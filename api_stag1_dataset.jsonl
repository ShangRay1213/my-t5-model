{"input": "I purchased Maverick beef jerky peppered and the natural one and broke my tooth really bad. I spoke with them and they suggested giving me a gift card, I thought that was ridiculous. I suggest that the damn that they call the company that makes the product and see if there was any other issues with other customers about this. I'm sure they didn't do anything about it I'll check into it as far as I'm concerned. Concerned customer"}
{"input": "I really enjoy this mall (especially during the summer; not so much during the winter) as its an outdoor mall! \nAs a whole it shows really well, it's always clean, I never see trash flying around, which I'm guessing has to require a lot of cleaning for an outdoor mall! \nI think they have a wide variety of shopping and food options, I like that it doesn't have fast food like most malls do! I do wish there were more dining options though. \nThis is definitely my favorite place to go shopping in Reno!"}
{"input": "I take out-of-towners to Ralphs to experience authentic South Philly Italian food.   Ralph's never disappoints.  It may not be fancy, but it's classic and damn good.\n\nThey are best known for their veal specials, but make a pretty mean chicken  or eggplant parmesan, too.  Other good choices are the antipasto, gnocchi, mussels, and Italian sausage.   But folks are right; the spaghetti is just OK.\n\nMake reservations, and don't forget to bring your patience (it can get loud and crowded), cash, and plenty of friends."}
{"input": "Came to Philly for a family event but stayed a little further out. Had dinner at this place and it was delicious! My favorite was the chicken chilli!"}
{"input": "This is a fabulous gym.  Considering the cost, it provides a lot of fitness opportunities. I look for a gym that has a lot of classes at various times so that I can fit in exercise before or after work. As my work start and end times change from day to day, though, I need a gym that has classes at various times throughout the early morning and mid to late afternoon.  I found that the class schedule here meets that need. The trainers are excellent.  The spin and row teachers are really exceptional.  Try the We-Fit class, but expect a huge challenge, even if you are fit.  The facility is very clean, but this is a new enterprise, so time will tell if the business will continue to keep things clean and fresh.  I love that the women's locker room contains a blow dryer and extra hair ties.  These little things make a huge difference. Thanks for thinking of them."}
{"input": "This place is a disaster in slow motion.  I would avoid this place like the plague.  Most mornings the drive-thru service is so backed up it blocks traffic on Bloomingdale.  The traffic pattern within the property where the location sits is horrible.  Also the service, while my expectations are not high, is extremely slow and often incorrect.\n\nThis location is also not owned or operated by Dunkin corporate either, so if you have a problem that management does not resolve at this location, no one at corporate can do anything for you, you are just SOL.\n\nI won't even go here to buy my beans anymore they have messed up that much, DD does have great coffee, but this place can mess that up to and has.  Bad management, no pride of work, and just not worth the time and money."}
{"input": "I'll keep this brief. I came in for an oil change and a half hour later they return to me letting me know they cannot service the car because the engine needs replacing. Yes, the engine. So I drove to the dealership and they changed the oil for $40. No engine replacement necessary."}
{"input": "I heard this is the original Habit so I had to try it.\n\nNot disappointed at all! The Charburger is excellent along with their fries. bottomless drinks is a plus.\n\nIt's located in old town Goleta with ample parking out back. \n\nI can't stay if I like this more than In-n-out so I have to say I like this place just as much as In-n-out. Definitely my go to burger joint."}
{"input": "1st time dining here was for business, at the recommendation of a co-worker. The hibachi was good, but the sushi was even better. 2nd visit was for sushi takeout, and if possible, was better than the first visit. Gave only 4 stars because I have had better hibachi (though this is good). As a sushi place, it's a 5!"}
{"input": "Ordered a giant plate of biscuits and gravy with chorizo on top and the food is delicious! I recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"input": "This place is awesome. A real throwback. Music is great, 4 stars (not 5) as they don't really offer seating beyond the first 15 ppl in line."}
{"input": "My favorite deli in the area! Mostly because it's one of the only deli's in the area. :)\n\nPickles & pickled tomatoes. Delicious pastrami, corned beef, brisket, cabbage soup! Huge sandwiches... delicious! Wash it down with a CelRay soda!\n\nJewish deli for lunch...and some Italian stuff to take home on the way out. \n\nOne of my favorite places in town! Wait staff is very friendly as well!"}
{"input": "F*** this place I will never come back here, the people told me to pay before they did my manicure, I mean I know not many black males or males in general come in to get these things done, but dam."}
{"input": "This place is amazing!  I have been coming here for waxing services for a few years now.  I usually go to Lori Berger but have had appointments with other estheticians as well.  I have no complaints about any of the services I have received here and would highly recommend!  The space is cute, clean, and always smells amazing.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"input": "Healthy food is a rarity in Nola, and HK does healthy food fast. I live in the campus area and I love the convenience of this place. The menu covers it all really, so whatever I'm in the mood for they usually have it."}
{"input": "My wife and I visited this hidden gem today and were not let down. The shop was clean, bright, colorful, and comfortable. We were able to sample all the flavors, listen to the story of how they came about, and walked off with many bags of deliciousness. The owners there were so kind. They took the time to understand exactly what kind of foods we enjoy to match us up with the perfect popcorn. Definitely coming back soon!"}
{"input": "Came with the family based on a recommendation and was not disappointed.  I consider myself to be a bit of a Pizza connoisseur and this was right up there.  The staff was friendly and the food came out quick.  Solid experience across the board.  I would come back and recommend it to others."}
{"input": "Fantastic service, great food, and themed trivia every Thursday night, just make sure you reserve a table ahead of time they fill up fast"}
{"input": "Stopped by here for a coffee break and the reviews did not disappoint. The service was awesome, I changed my drink order and they didn't even sweat it! They have these Delish cookies you have to try called the s'more rocher.. so yummy that I ended up buying all of them!! I ordered the matcha latte and looks do not deceive! A must go chill spot away from the crowd!"}
{"input": "Been here twice for sushi. Servers are fantastic- knowledgeable, patient, and not pushy"}
{"input": "Great, authentic food. Attentive and gracious service at a very good value. We've been here many times. It's become a \"go to\" and has set a pretty high bar. We have had pad Thai of course several times and it never disappoints. Ingredients were fresh and tangy. Crispy spring rolls are consistently good and not too doughy like most. Some of our favorite dishes are the crispy duck, BBQ squid, Meing cum and the Thai Salad. They will happily customize the curry to your heat tolerance level. Love this place for the food and service. The only thing that could make it better would be if they moved into Phoenixville downtown (but no doubt the parking would be much more challenging). Very easy and free parking in the shopping center where they are located."}
{"input": "I always am in favor of local businesses.  They have a big selection here and you get free popcorn.  Why go to the big boys and have to pay for popcorn when you can get it here for free?"}
{"input": "Best sandwiches in St.Louis! Could eat here everyday. Always a very friendly crowd when I come and eat here."}
{"input": "Very underwhelmed! I'm confused on the high ratings so im wondering if we were here on an off day. Good: smoked salmon, croissants. Bad: everything else. Here are the highlights: Waiter was confused and didn't know brunch menu very well. Menu said ask Waiter for french toast and eggs Benedict. Waiter says thats not the case but he'd be willing to go to the bar and get for us. Carving station and omelet station was run by one person who was trying not to get overwhelmed. Buffet selection was large but the gravy and clam chowder tasted pretty much the same, as did many of the dishes which was odd. With amazing brunch options like Mere Bulles, Copper Kettle, Ellendales, etc, I'd advise you to bypass this place. Did I mention we never got our drinks refilled and they bussed our table mid-meal?"}
{"input": "Worst service ever. We were really excited to try this place out as everyone raves so much about it. My sister lives here and while I was visiting, we decided to try it. We waited in line for about 30 minutes (I understand this is popular, so it's fine). We waited for a long time while we were seated waiting dor our food while everyone around us (who came AFTER US) had been served. Food isn't as expected, quality sucked for what you wait for. IHOP is WAY BETTER. Don't waste your time, we complained to the manager and all we got was \"I'm sorry\", no actions were taken on the management side. Disappointed, will NEVER come here and not recommended."}
{"input": "One of my favorites to take out of town guests to, or for any special occasion. Intimate setting that it great for conversation and the food is exceptional. Friendly, family-oriented restaurant that you can tell has stood the test of time for a reason. This place is an experience! Be sure to wear stretchy pants because you will be FULL when you leave. :)"}
{"input": "The service at Ava was wonderful but the entree salad I ordered was at best a starter size. My husband ordered a burger which came over cooked and way overloaded with too many salty options"}
{"input": "All earlier reviews were erased! so....Easily the best florist in the city! Michael, the owner, and his staff are absolute sweethearts and great at customer satisfaction. I am regular here, getting flowers for my sweetie at least twice a month and the staff always treat me like an old friend! Great selection of home goods and cool unusual plants. \nAlways helpful with any questions regarding plants and gardening, these guys rock. They do window boxes and small backyards as well, but beware they get booked up quickly so give them some time to get to you."}
{"input": "The cheesecake is the best I've ever had. It's so mouthwatering delicious I drove back from New York just to get it!"}
{"input": "Great tour! Very informative  (our tour guide Raymond was awesome!) and the food stops along the way were very delicious. Definitely worth the time and money."}
{"input": "The food is great. A true taco truck.  I only wish they would set up recycling for the cans and bottles.  Otherwise a Tucson classic.. almost better than Guero Canelo."}
{"input": "The staff was friendly and informative. I had the chicken adobo which was excellent and delicious"}
{"input": "The chargrilled oysters are amazing! The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is being the service was kind of terrible. My shrimp po boy was awesome, but my sister said her alligator po boy was just okay."}
{"input": "Perfect dinner spot !!! Went here tonight with one friend and got sat right away in a very nice private spot. We only got appetizers and coffee and it was the perfect place for that, great service and environment. Totally going to come back for more than appetizers !!"}
{"input": "THIS RESTAURANT IS NOT CLOSED.   Was just there today April 1, 2015 for a wonderful meal.   I had beef dish and chicken on a stick.  Food was so good, I got some to take home including egg roll which was fantastic.   \n\nIt is bit hard to see.   It is at inter section of Keystone on Raymond, next to Burger King."}
{"input": "I was very happy here.there is a shower with a slider door,a closet with an iron and ironing board (it has a reflection,so,thinking it was a portal,I walked right into it)plus,some people have to get have to get up early,so there is a complimentary shuttle.also,there is free wifi,and the front desk is open 24/7.it is right next to the Reno Tahoe international airport.i LOVE this place.there are so many reasons I love it,because no this place has great service."}
{"input": "Blackened fish tacos were tasty, good flavor, just wish they came with something other than fries. Atmosphere is good with faux candles lining the boundary and live music. Keep in mind you are in Florida and there is no smoking rules around the perimeter of the building and everyone here seems to smoke."}
{"input": "This place was nice, clean, and bright. It's your typical serve-yourself fro yo bar with several choices for frozen yogurt and a topping station. The cashier was very (berry?) nice and let me pay via credit card even though I was a few cents short of the minimum. I'd say my son enjoyed his time here."}
{"input": "This is actually a 3 1/2 star review for me. Only because everything that I wanted they did not have or weren't willing to do. Firstly, I came here specifically for the chicken slider because from the picture it showed that you can get it on a biscuit and when I told the lady taking my order, she said they don't do that -__-. Then I wanted that buttermilk bites and they weren't available, however, my brother ordered the brown buttered cream sundae and got the buttermilk bites in that!! Oh yes, and the glazed donuts are so thick and dry. I liked the sliders I had though: fried chicken, beef belly and catfish(okay). And the sundae is pretty tasty. Good for a first try but not to continue coming."}
{"input": "Had lunch at Carrabbas yesterday and if it weren't for the attentiveness and professionalism of the bartenders we would never return to this establishment. We waited over an hour and a half for food and asked to speak with a manger maybe 20 times during the entire experience, needless to say he never came over. Jen and Marcus handled everything perfectly, which is the only reason I'm rating this place 3 stars. It was happy hour and they kept us entertained and in good spirits while we waited forever to eat. When the food finally arrived everything was delicious. Marcus recommended The Johnny with fettuccine Alfredo and it was excellent. My wife also enjoyed the Johnny Rocco salad. We would definitely dine here regularly once all of the kinks are worked out but management needs to realize that this is New Orleans there are plenty of place to enjoy good food. Take care of your guest."}
{"input": "AMAZING!!! I just got back from the bakery. I ordered tres leche, hubby got chocolate dipped cannoli with original filling, we also got Italian wedding cookies, and dark chocolate florentine cookies. The tres leche taste just like my grandma used to make it minus the Malibu liquor. The cannoli was delicious. The Italian wedding cookies was a little crunchy yet still delicate, it also had the perfect amount of Anise flavor. The dark chocolate florentine is so yummy, that says a lot because I don't like coconut. The chocolate to coconut ratio is perfect. We will definitely be going back."}
{"input": "A little place to grab a quick slice and for $1.25 you can't beat it. Fast, convenient and cheap plus the pizza is actually good. The owner is an old school Italian kinda guy and I had the joy of shooting the shit with him while he heated the slice up. In this day and age these kind of places are far and beyond getting harder to find but look past the low key interior the rough edges on the place just remember $1.25 a slice."}
{"input": "Great ambiance!  Loved the trendy and modern decor.  The presentation of the dishes was also great.  The food was just okay though.  The potatoes weren't cooked and the pancakes were a bit on the greasy side.  Would def. go back again and give it another try...french toast and omelette looked good!  I would also like to try their lunch. Service was excellent."}
{"input": "I know everybody seems to love this place but both times I've gotten attitude on trying to order simple things. i. e. An iced green tea. I basically ended up making it myself. Maybe I'm being a princess, but how difficult is it to make an iced green tea. \n\nI really would love to love this place, but no wifi. What?!?!? I'd park myself here regularly to work if they had wifi & yes that means I would be eating & sipping the whole time."}
{"input": "Farmhaus is another great restaurant in St. Louis.  My bf and I went for lunch.  It was excellent food with a great price.  Next time we are in St. Louis we will go there for dinner."}
{"input": "The only reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because of the HOSTESS!  Now, I go to a lot of restaurants. The hostess (petite black girl) is extremely rude with an attitude. As soon as we walked through the doors, she looked at us and said the wait would be 30mins (which wasn't the case because she sat another couple down 5 min after us). Someone needs to fire her! She brought our menus over and just put them on the table, rolled her eyes and walked away. No smile, nothing. What a horrible start of our meal. Then the same thing happened to the couple who sat next to us where the couple said thank you for bringing the menus and she walked away without saying anything or smiling! \n\nThe bartenders and waiters are attentive and nice. \nThe burger here is wonderful! It's big, juicy and full of flavor. 5 stars for a delicious burger!"}
{"input": "Open 24/7 plenty of equipment never too crowded classes also available the staff is always friendly and willing to help the district manager stops in as well every week to Make sure everything is on the up and up and my membership is good everything!"}
{"input": "Mini size boong-uh-bbang for $2???\nPhoto looks like regular size. \nFalse advertising."}
{"input": "First time my girlfriend and I came here and it was delicious. The French toast was just right. The thing that did for me though was the hash browns, absolutely amazing. Waiter was kind and was nice enough to check up on my girlfriend and I to see how we're doing. Great experience!"}
{"input": "The Hummus Envy was so good! I chose the jalapeño cilantro hummus and the garlic hummus. The servings are huge and the severs are very friendly."}
{"input": "Love this place. So far I've had three different barbers and each cut has been perfect. Never used a legit barber shop before and i couldn't be happier to have switched. The fades are tight, love the shape up, barbers are all cool, good barber shop talk, sports on tv, and not too pricey. Who could complain? I usually go mid day during the week, so not sure about normal wait times, but I've never had to wait. Great place."}
{"input": "Since this is a live act venue you cant review whether or not the show itself was funny.\n\nI can only review the service and the price .\n\nService \nGet at Least 2 drinks at a time because the drinks are super slow to come\n\nPrice value\nCheck out YouTube of your headliners before you go.\n\nPre shows\nThis was one of the worst experiences I've had . You don't get in till right before.\nThere isn't anywhere to seat pre show . So you get to stand like cattle.\n\nWtf? Also there are no washrooms , you have to go to earls across the street.\n\nWow. Weak.\n\nCome to this venue if you are looking for a low rent but possible fun time.\n\nIt's like going to a bowling alley for comedy/"}
{"input": "Nice warm atmosphere, friendly staff, tons of menu variations. Price $7 to $10 average for calzones. Big portions. Loved it! Had the Duke calzone. Very good! Definately recommend if in the area!"}
{"input": "OMG! Breakfast pizza and bottomless mimosas and bloody marys. Is there anything better in this world? Even got a handshake on the way out the door. Service like that seems scarce these days"}
{"input": "I didn't use to frequent the market often but my coworker made me go after work one day and now it has become our Friday treat after a long day at work!!! The chicken enchiladas are AwESOME!! No really!!! I'm hooked and the southwest chicken salad is good hot or cold, and bc I spread the word I have to buy it weekly before my mother in law gets it's, there nice here always helpful!! We tried the chicken taqutios today. Guess what. Also good. We will be back again n again great flavor:)"}
{"input": "My dad and I are on a cross country trip and one of our first stops was Saguaro National Park. \nWe did a quick tour with Park Ranger Carolyn and loved it. She was incredibly enthusiastic and passionate about her studies on the saguaro and she was very knowledgeable. Definitely recommend both the tour and Carolyn."}
{"input": "I went to the salon for a hair cut and Meghan was my stylist. She did an ABSOLUTELY amazing job and was full of personality. I got a wash, cut, and blow out all for $27 bucks because it was my first time! I also got a coupon to come back for 20% off anything I have done in the salon which I will be redeeming later this month. I am very excited to find a great salon that is near my house & doesn't cost a million dollars to get something done. \n\nI have been here for the Benefit Brow Bar as well which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND, if you want your brows to look amazing - it is the best place you can go . I trust them with my life. \n\nI really can't say anything negative about Ulta. I am surprised at the \"rude customer service\" complaint because I have only experienced the best here. (plus there is always a coupon so I really REALLY love this place).\n\nOK bye!"}
{"input": "Downgrading my previous rating, I've visited Double Greeting three times since I wrote that most recent review and the food has been underwhelming at best every single time.  I'd pass this place by if I were you.  It's overrated."}
{"input": "It's ironic that you asked me to call you with no number. Before placing this review, I called and asked for a managers email , they said they don't have email addresses, I left a voicemail and the manager didn't even bother to call back. 3 days later I get a call from another sales rep. I know it can be busy within a day's work but no call back for 3 days ? This is unacceptable for a business who is looking to sell cars. Thank you for answering my review."}
{"input": "Ordered online through Yelp and got roast beef hoagie with extra Swiss cheese. I got the sandwich and it had American on it and only a few slices. So I call them up and describe the mix up. The guy on the phone says \"we don't have Swiss\" (despite it being an option on the online order form). And when I asked why he didn't call to let me know, he said \"oh someone probably tried to call you.\" I had no missed calls on my phone, so that obviously was a lie. Then I asked about the extra cheese that I ordered and he said all sandwiches get two slices of cheese, and extra cheese means you get three slices.  I told him that our definition of extra cheese is very different. I'd like to say I'll never order from here again, but they have good food just shitty customer service."}
{"input": "This is a nice Indian buffet with a pretty wide selection.  There is nothing that will make you say \"wow\", but many good Indian dishes for a very reasonable price.  Would return again."}
{"input": "Their pizza was ok, I think they need to cook the pizzas alittle more and have more tastier cheese. They do have a large delivery area in southern Tampa, as well as Ybor."}
{"input": "We may have visited on an off day. Tacos and gauc were good but no comparison to Funky Taco. $15 for a cold glass of the only Cab Sauv on the menu was disappointing. Seriously, that much for a glass of wine?  Mushroom taco that said was a mix of many mushrooms was all portobellos with one shiitake mushroom? Not ok. Great setting but need to refine quality. Blackened fish taco had no blackening. Might try again, maybe."}
{"input": "This place is great!  The prices are reasonable for the quality of the clothes you find; most of what they carry is either new or like-new.  I always love finding the original price tags, even if they don't show the original prices.  Definitely check out the shoes and clearance area!\n\nWorkers are nice, and tend to keep to themselves, though they are very attentive when you ask for help."}
{"input": "The place is beautiful, but prices are over the top, i went for my Birthday with my mom, niece,and sister i didn't have to make a reservation because it was during the week. They only have small tables so we were a little tight, I ordered the Birthday cake and my sister the raspberry cake, my felt dry but the icing was good. My sister's was moist and icing was good."}
{"input": "The food is amazing here! Would highly recommend the chicken satay, roti canai, mee goreng noodles, and beef rendang! \n\nThe only downside it is not BYOB, while most other places in Chinatown are. The food doesn't always come out right on time but service is decent!"}
{"input": "Really truly slow service.  Not the waitress. The kitchen. 40 min to get a pasta and salad.  Recommended if you want to really drag that date out."}
{"input": "We visited Village Bakehouse after reading the reviews and were very happy we did. The place has such a homey feel, but small. We waited a few minutes for a table, but were occupied looking at all the goodies. The breakfast prices are very reasonable, under $5 for many items. Pecan sticky bun was amazing!"}
{"input": "i've only come for ice cream so i can't attest to this establishment's other charms per the 4 and 5 star reviews. \n\nafter dinner, a friend of mine suggested ice cream, and this was the place closest to the restaurant.  the cafe area that housed the desserts was charming though in need of some refurbishing (the entire area looked worn down.)  the ice cream was so-so...i could get the same quality product at a grocery store. plus, the ice cream melted entirely too quickly. my dining companion wasn't blown away by her selection either. in addition to ice cream, there were other baked goods - apple pie, peanut butter pie, etc. but they didn't appear all that appealing (investing in nicer display cases might help.) \n\ni would give this place another shot since one visit doesn't mean MTJIC isn't worth it, but i'll only stop by if i'm in the area."}
{"input": "Delicious crab cakes, both the appetizer and the sandwich! Happy hour until 6:30 means all appetizers are just $6, so I couldn't pass them up! Bar staff were friendly, and kept my glasses full."}
{"input": "Great food and service as well. The shrimp app is really good and the burger is one of the best I have ever had."}
{"input": "Spur of the moment decision to eat there last night - we dined in. Am happy we tried it. The steamed dumplings were delicious. The pork egg foo young was absolutely delicious. I could definitely taste it was fresh and made on the spot, not pre-made and frozen. For once, I could actually taste the egg. My husband had the pork lo mein, and he gave it a thumb's up. No, it's not NYC.... Come on people....accept that you live in Tampa Bay and judge accordingly. China City is not the prettiest of places, but hey, I find that holes-in-the-wall stay in business because the food speaks for itself."}
{"input": "Comfortable room with a awesome guitar swimming pool. \nShort trip to downtown.\nRooms are clean and staff are friendly."}
{"input": "My favorite brunch spot in Nashville. You have to come here if you are visiting. Although you will be waiting in line no matter what time you get there. Lines are long before the place even opens. The hype is real!"}
{"input": "The best fried rice ever! Also the best Pho I had while in Nashville. I'm from Seattle so I'm a little spoiled in that department. If you're looking for a good place to try it for the first time or just looking for a good Vietnamese restaurant, GO!"}
{"input": "I totally live in this target is only few minutes away from my house it has everything I need, but the only reason why I give it 4 star is because there's is no Starbucks but besides that's this is my favorite store !"}
{"input": "My husband is a huge fan of Chinese buffets, but this place did not live up to its name. At all. We got there 5 minutes after they opened expecting fresh food on the buffet. It tasted like they brought out yesterday's leftovers. The baked chicken was over cooked. Most items were sitting in puddles of grease. Everything we put on our plates was cold or lukewarm. The egg drop soup was bland. Sushi had very little variety (every roll had cucumber and crab, and then something else on top). They do offer a military discount, but at the higher Sunday price it was NOT worth it. There are other options in town. Stay away from this place."}
{"input": "Great Mexican food at Ucity. I was a bit skeptical going in on a Wednesday night, but the environment was very homely (the murals are a bit sketchy though) and the staff very helpful. \nThey have 'free' nachos like most mexican places these days, but the salsa was delicious (I had to stop myself from overeating nachos before my meal).\nBeing a vegetarian, I can't get into the majority of the menu, but my colleagues can attest to it's quality and the staffs willingness for customization. I felt my enchilada was just right. Portions are great too !\nDefinitely would revisit !"}
{"input": "Ask yourself a question, are you going for food or a blizzard. If it is anything other than a blizzard find a different DQ. Sadly it seems to be ran by young adults not even out of high school so don't expect the beat they have to offer."}
{"input": "LOVE chiptole- all locations! this location had great customer service and the food is siesta on point!"}
{"input": "This place has gone downhill in a hurry.  When it first opened, the donuts were actually good and had creative toppings.  Now they have creative topping but the actual donuts don't taste fresh.  They have opened up a few locations and now the quality at the original location isn't there."}
{"input": "Over the last year I've tried many, many, many things on the menu.  My rating has not changed.\n\nFirst, parking can be a bear.  Despite the numerous parking spaces, it's still gonna be tough getting in and out, and a spot, but trust me, you'll be fine with a little walk to the door.  Get there a little early from the lunch hour or you'll be waiting in line and you'll be looking for a spot to park your butt.\n\nNow that you're inside, check out the menu board.  There's nothing I've tried that isn't good, and most things are great.  Fish Taco Tuesday...it should be added to the Outlook calendar as a standard reminder.  Brisket tacos, with BBQ sauce (I add the white sauce too), are splendid.  Tortas, burritos, whatever you pick, you're probably gonna be under $10 with a drink and chips, so splurge for the white, creamy goodness called queso.  Once you've paid, go to the drinks and pick \"Baja Fruit Tea\" as your drink.  You're welcome."}
{"input": "The korean wings are really good I like that they use real fresh chicken even for the boneless wings. The mega fries were solid and I like the variety of sauces although I do wish they had a better garlic parm."}
{"input": "Awesome sangria.  Rotating craft beers. Pizza and calzones keep me coming back"}
{"input": "Please Sheraton, put this hotel next on your list for renovations.  Our room kind of looks like like a tag sale of furniture acquired between 1970 and 2000, and the grout in the bathroom has turned pretty black.  In fact, it looks just like I remember Sheratons looking when I stayed in them as a kid. And, the fitness center has a ripped up treadmill, loud elliptical, and ceilings not exactly conducive to a tall man lifting weights.\n\nBright spots were the lemonade at afternoon check-in, the 1875 watt hairdryer, and if we were the wedding (or prom) crashing types, it would be easy at the Sheraton.  \n\nGiven the choice, I'd stay elsewhere (after a string of bad Starwood experiences, the chain has yet to redeem itself), but hotel rooms were in short supply."}
{"input": "expensive, bad food and service.\nI have been to other corner bakery cafes, and I usually like them, but I tend to get terrible service at this one. These problems manifests as long waits for meals even during slow times, and getting orders wrong.\nThe last time (never again) I went in it was a slow morning, and it took them 45 minutes to get me my eggs, and when they came they were cold. I informed the cashier that my eggs were cold and I asked him if they could make me new eggs.  He said yes, and took my eggs.  He came back out with my same plate, and it was evident that he microwaved the plate with the toast and fruit on it; the toast was soggy, and fruit warm. I returned my food, and have vowed to never return."}
{"input": "We ordered take out and ate by the ocean on the pier! Food was kind of pricey and not enough for the price."}
{"input": "Service by our server was great. But the rest of the staff seemed to be more interested i. Each other than helping the servers that were swamped. Took 45 minutes to get cold hamburgers!"}
{"input": "I've done take-out from this restaurant several times when I'm in this part of Philly. \nIf you have read my other reviews on yelp, you know I have tried several different Indian restaurants, so I'm very familiar with the cuisine and what to expect.\nWhat I like about Mumbai Bistro:\n1) The prices -- most affordable Indian food. If you're on a budget like me, this is perfect.\n2) Simple, easy-to-understand menu. It also tells you what's spicy, what's gluten free, what contains dairy.\n3) Fast service. Even if you don't call in and order ahead for take-out, they get your to-go order ready in 5-10 mins.\n4) The food taste and quality is good. Good selection of appetizers and entrees. It's not THE best Indian food ever (you get what you pay for), but it's always good, enjoyable.\n\nThere's nothing I really dislike about this place."}
{"input": "As an active runner my shoes are my life force. Endurance House has a fantastic selection of shoes for all runners.  The staff are always nice and helpful. What sets them apart from other stores is how they check for what shoe will best suit your stride and reduce injury.  I will happily keep coming back and know that I will get a good price, a great pair of shoes, and have personalized help."}
{"input": "The food is good the service is terrible i went there about 3 times with my cousins and the people workin there were on the phones or talking to the other employees i didn't know if i should go and pour myself a refill or ask the waitress that was working at the time for a refill she took forever to come and check up on us and i would understand if it was busy but me and my family were the only ones in the restaurant and i think i understand know why were the only ones in that place i thought i came in to dine in not to get up and refill my drink myself if i wanted to get up and refill my own drink i would have went to McDonald's is this place a fast food place or a dine in restaurant and truly believe McDonald's has better service. Only thing that's holding me back from going there again is the service it's sad to say"}
{"input": "10/23/2015 at 7:45am Friday TICKET NUMBER 624\n\nOne white guy making sandwiches alone. There are two other black female team members was standing around talking about how they got paid today. Not doing a damm thing while he takes all the tickets. The shorter one of the two get's my ticket and mumbles my number and then takes on other orders that have been backing up. They ran out of sauté onions so for 10 mins I stand there watching others after me get their order. She did a piss poor job of correcting the issue. She needs to be retrained on the rule of FIRST IN FIRST OUT. Help out team members on a BUSY FRIDAY MORNING. I will no longer place corporate orders for ANY of our events here at the University because of this incident. She made no effort to correct the problem or respect my busy time. WHY WAS ONE MAN DOING ALL THE TICKETS ON A FRIDAY MORNING! I was lucky enough to have her pick up me as the first ticket to be skipped. I will skip this WAWA from now on."}
{"input": "Bomb.com! I forget what I ordered but it was similar to a Cuban sandwich on donut bread. My friend ordered a cinnamon sugar donut while she waited for her actual food and that was delicious. I ate everything because it was amazing and deserves all the hype it has received. I need to go back and try those stuffed donuts."}
{"input": "I hurt my back at the gym and was actually pretty worried I really hurt myself but they got me in the next morning and were able to straighten me out. I called around and the pricing, quick service, and location made it an easy choice. Would definitely recommend them to friends and family."}
{"input": "They should change their signage for their hours. I've been multiple times in the afternoon to try to have lunch and they are always closed. I like this place late night for pizza. But they make good burgers and sandwiches, but are never open during their posted hours for lunch."}
{"input": "Amazing food and service. Excellent EXO coffee. \nVegetarian and gluten free options. Highly recommended!!\nI used the app to put our party on the wait list and by the time we arrived we were seated In under 10 minutes. \nWhat a gem of a place!!"}
{"input": "This place is horrible. Do not get bottle service.  The bottles are over priced and the waitresses poor drinks extremely strong so you have to purchase another bottle. They will also charge you for more than you purchased, thinking that you are too drunk to realize. The manager comped us for their mistake but still made us feel that we were wrong. I was not impressed."}
{"input": "no bueno...annoyed I couldn't get any service and the prices are a joke."}
{"input": "A local favorite.  I get consistently good food every time I eat here.  Nice staff. Great chicken tender.  Great buffalo chicken cheesesteak.  I'm never disappointed with my food when I order from Fresh Works."}
{"input": "My first experience with Mongolian BBQ was in Westwood, CA -- home of the UCLA Bruins. I loved it. Then the versions at the mall food courts popped up in CA, and it was decent.\n\nCI Chu's is great! Cleaner than the one in Westwood. More selection than any of the others I've been to. I love having tofu as an option, even though I'm not a vegetarian. I love the soup and the bread that come as part of the meal. It's never been crowded when I've been there. (By the way, I prefer the one on Broadway to the one on Tanque Verde, service-wise. The food is just as good.)\n\nThe only downside is that it is a tad pricey -- I only go when I'm totally starving, since you can't (usually?) take doggy bags."}
{"input": "Delish! One of my favorite sb pizza joints. Yummy thin crust, great toppings, and great variety on the menu. Just wish it wasn't in the mall!"}
{"input": "I have been going here for a few months now. I switched to this gym from being a Ballys member for 10 years for the amenities. The place looks clean, the towels are a great plus and the people that both work and work out here are nice. I also love the PRX class that Fania teaches as well as her pilates classes.\nThat being said, I don't appreciate the loud Zumba music at 10 am on a Sunday. I am most likely half hungover and trying to function as a human being at that time, I really don't need to hear regaeton music blasting from the work out room that I can hear floors below. \nOne thing I wish they would do is post on their website and on the facebook page when the gym will close early and update the class descriptions on their site. \nOther than those few suggestions, I really love this place and it makes me want to work out every day."}
{"input": "Pina's is easily one of the mroe underated places to eat in Roxborough. They have great stromboli (which are HUGE) and thier sicilian pie is the best I have every had. Sandwiches and pizza are just ok. \n\nI stopped ina two occassions for a sit down dinner and came away very stisfied and full. Ordered the chicken park with was a huge chickem covered in cheese and sauce. Excellent."}
{"input": "What can I say about my experience with Eric at One Stop Guitar?  I bought a Groupon (or Deal Chicken) years ago in hopes of picking up a new hobby and I came across Eric.  I bought some personal lessons on a whim for really cheap as for something to do on off nights. At the time (building has since been torn down and rebuilt) the shop was an awesome little studio right downtown and open late in the evening to work around my busy schedule. I couldnt have been more impressed with Eric's level of knowledge and the actual art of teaching students how to play the guitar.  I even continued going to see Eric after the 5 sessions were used because he made guitar learning fun!  You can probably learn how to play a guitar online, I changed an car alternator from a video on youtube, but you'll be miserable without some personal guidance from the best guitarist in town.  Eric's an absolute stud, he loves what he does and it shows. Young or old, give him a look!"}

{"input": "Second night in a row at 2 Different LaQuintas, both times I am questioning whether the room has been cleaned properly, coffee stains and cup rings at one, and when I opened the door on the second, a piece of the heating/AC unit laying on the floor on one side of the bed and a empty to go cup on the other....needless to say, extremely disappointed"}
{"input": "My fiance and I ate here recently, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I had heard often enough that it was excellent, but I usually take others' high praise with a grain of salt. However, the Smiling Elephant definitely lived up to the hype. Both of our entrees were incredibly delicious - the best Thai food we've had in Nashville, by far. However, our appetizer (the spring rolls) were NOT very good, hence the four stars instead of five. Overall, though, I'd say a great place to go!"}
{"input": "We ordered the fried oyster and the catfish platter and sincerely speaking it was terrible. Incredibly greasy and please don't tell me it is because it is Cajun food. Moreover, the service is really bad. We wanted to sit but the place was packed so we ordered food and ate while standing up. When there was finally a place the waitress was really rude and said we couldn't sit because we had already ordered food and we were already eating. Hello? Funny thing is that one of the people eating at the bar had the same exact plastic container for to go food that I had. Please, don't ask me for tips on the receipt if you are going to give me a plastic box and will not let me sit in your restaurant."}
{"input": "Cut a couple of clubs down and took em in to have them gripped.  Prompt service, reasonably priced.  All in all, a very pleasant experience."}
{"input": "Best pizza ever... hands down.\n\nLove the peeps running the place - former hockey player (ask him to pop his nose) and adorable, but tough as nails wife... very funny.\n\nThey make their own sausage and mozzarella here.  And God help you if you mispronounce Ricotta!!\n\nAny of the pizzas are fab... we even eat the crusts - which is a rarity in our family.  Just dab it in the olive oil, and mayb ask for some of their viniagrette to dip too!"}

{"input": "Are you kidding me? This is without a doubt some of the best food I've ever had my life. The bread is the best, and I cannot believe the chocolate croissant. Ambience is wonderful, intriguing, and very chic. People are friendly and kind.  Coffee looks great but I didn't try it (yet! I WILL be back) Prices are good, too."}
{"input": "This restaurant is on point!!  My husband and I were at the entrance off the lobby just peeking in and one of the managers that was dropping something off stopped us and asked if we wanted to eat.  Only because of her friendly demeanor did we stop and eat.  Love love love this place.  Our waiter, unfortunately cannot remember his name...but he is darling, personable, and wore glasses and was by far the best waiter we have ever had.  The Bloody Mary bar was delish only outdone by the food!!!  OMG!!  Menu was so good and great selection.  The manager on duty came over to greet us and our service dog and told us more about the hotel.  So impressed that we switched our reservations for 2 weeks from Peppeemill to now to staying at Whitney Peaks!!  Keep up the great work and see you in 2 weeks!!!!"}
{"input": "This little restaurant can be summed up pretty easily with two words; overpriced and mediocre. \n\nThe waiter, while being nice, was a little too pushy for our tastes. The food was decent, but not worth the Country club pricing at all. \n\nI had a meatball sub, which if I recall correctly was one of the cheapest things on the menu. It came out Lukewarm with some fries. The portion is pretty small, again, taking that price into consideration. \n\nMy wife had a burger, It wasn't good enough to be memorable. Again, very middle of the road. \n\nThe decor when you walk in certainly didn't match what they were clearly going for. High end prices, with diner type atmosphere. \n\nThe waiter was quick to remove our plates, even tho there was still food on them. \n\nI don't think I'll be going back, it left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"input": "It was ok....Did like the homemade potato chips. Had to wait 10 mins after asking for the check as the waitress was talking with other guess. But food was good."}
{"input": "Very disappointed. We went to eat  at 2:15 on Saturday and were told the kitchen closed at 2. Their website says: Sat & Sun all day. Their website claims that they are open until 5.\nI'm always a bit suspect of places that can't manage simple details like their hours on their website. It makes me wonder about the awareness to quality and other \"small\" items."}
{"input": "Busy but quick and fast service with deliciously thick custard.  I had the turtle and it was everything I thought it would be, sweet, smooth with a bit of crunch.  This place is a St. Louis staple."}
{"input": "I just recently moved to Idaho and today I went to Chipotle and she comped me one meal (out of 3) and it made my week let alone my day lol. She was so nice to start with and had the best customer service! She definitely stood out in the staff, her name was Taylor. She's absolutely awesome!"}
{"input": "Great food and a small-town feel! Angie is one of the sweetest people and makes you feel so very welcomed!"}
{"input": "Delivery issues caused our pizza to be over 30 minutes later than the estimated delivery date.  Pizza finally arrived and was warm at best.  Won't be ordering from this location again."}
{"input": "The food is always excellent.  However, it is very difficult to hold a normal conversation due to the abnormally loud interiors. Please please add some acoustic treatments to this space so we can enjoy the tasty food without a throbbing headache."}
{"input": "I've been to Gilley's many times and love how they have it set up. You could get lost in there which I did trying to find my way out. Haha if you come to Gilley's give yourself a few hours it's big and lots to see and buy. They even have a flea market outside on certain days.  You'll love this store mark my words."}
{"input": "After reading the reviews we decided to try it out.  Waited about 1/2  hour and was seated at a dirty table with remnants of left over breakfast and on one of the chairs too.  Told the waiter and she hurriedly wiped it down but the table was still sticky. Ordered the croissant breakfast sandwich with no cheese and hubby ordered the big easy.  \nSandwich came out with cheese on it and had to send it back, hubby's eggs were under down.  Asked the waitress if the egg whites are suppose to be raw and really runny and she huffily said yes....mmmm okay....had eggs at our restaurant establishments and when they make it over easy the egg whites are not raw and runny.\nAfter that, waitress didn't check up on us during our entire meal.\nWouldn't go back."}
{"input": "I was all too underwhelmed by Pre and Pastry. My amazing fiancée and I went there for breakfast one day with high expectations! I love a good breakfast and am a picky eater. I understand that not everywhere has something I love, but I remained hopeful!\nThe inside is darling and has a promising ambiance. We were sat at a tiny table that was incredible unstable. Once we had our waters and coffee the table was nearly full and very shakey. Our server was an awkward girl who wouldn't look us in the eyes. \nI ordered the sweet potato hash with no eggs and my fiancée had duck fat gravy with biscuits. My meal had little to no flavor and I ended up using tobasco to make it resemble tasting like something. My Fiancée said his meal had no flavor and was greasey. \nMaybe if we ordered differently, we could really like the place, but we are turned off by it now. If you go, do not get the sweet potato hash!"}
{"input": "It simply does not get any better than Tako for sushi. Everything is fresh & delicious. The private rooms are so fun for a festive night out, it's BYO & when my girls get together we enjoy the feast & atmosphere! Some personal favorites are the jalapeño yellowtail(a must!!), kani salad, bird's nest roll & the naruto (served in cucumber instead of rice. Honestly, you can't go wrong when ordering. And so reasonable!! I rarely spend over $35 including tip when we go, and we do not hold back at all when ordering. Highly, highly recommend Tako!"}
{"input": "Great to have a new spot in Temple Terrace. Food is good. Service is good. However, I'm not sure if they are trying to be a night club or a restaurant. The Music is so dang loud it's hard to think let alone carry on a conversation w/ folks I'm hanging out with. Turn down the music & you will get more business!"}
{"input": "Outstanding Indian cuisine. We are not native eaters and the waiter was patient and helpful with us ordering. I had the vegetable biryani. Probably for the first time and I liked it. I also tried the garlic gobi. Batter is tasty and the cauliflower is tender.\n\nFor a place in a strip mall the interior decor is particularly upscale and all food is presented professionally."}
{"input": "I love their atmosphere and there are plenty of outlets.  a little secret that most people dont realize, there is an outlet outside in each lower corner of the two windows, outside on the patio.  I have tourette's syndrome, and my uncontrollable tic is a cough.  its not a real cough, its \"tic\", like people who twitch, but people think Im sick.  the baristas were very understanding and Ive only had one issue with a customer. I cant say Im too fond that its \"no name\" coffee that sits in an airpot til its gone, which could be a half hour or could me 3 hours (unlikely tho), but its REALLY GOOD! \n\nI would HIGHLY recommend this coffee shop!  I LOVE IT!"}
{"input": "Good place. Good people and fair pricing. They got the job done on time and for less than they estimated."}
{"input": "I have an old 1999 Subaru Outback Legacy with nearly 300,000 miles on it. I've been brining it to Buck's for several years now for regular checkups and oil changes, and whatever else comes up. Theses guys provide the best service I've ever experienced with an automotive service place. They've kept my car happy and running for a lot of miles! I highly recommend Buck's. They are worth every penny!"}
{"input": "To maximize the hot pot experience: come with a group of friends, take your time and prepare your favorite sauce.\nOur group of 7 people occupied the big round table so we got enough table space for all the materials . I tried Coty S sauce recipe. It turned out quite delicious , I loved it. We ordered, cooked or grilled, ate, enjoyed the conversation. After 2 hours, my tummy was happy. We were each served a complementary small Yogurt drink. The services were good. They added venting vacuum on top of each small table, so the grilling was less smoky . Overall the materials were fresh . The selections were wide.  I enjoyed the hot pot meal."}
{"input": "I have been going to this park since I was a child and as an adult I now hold an annual pass. The pass is well worth it, because it is less than the cost of three admissions. \n\nI love the selection of treats in the park. The bakery has fresh baked bread and it is delicious. Old fashioned candy can be found on the midway and in a couple of stores throughout the park. Have lunch in the Hotel Selkirk, the prices are reasonable and the food is much better than the short order place. \n\nTry going on a rainy day, the park will be less crowded and the interpreters will have more time to interact with you!"}
{"input": "Yesterday was my first experience at Thai Thanee.  The space was large and inviting.  As far as I could tell, there was only one waitress, but she was personable, attentive and fast.  \n\nThe chicken satay ranks among the best that I've EVER had, moist tender and very flavorful.  The basil with chicken was very good, even if not quite as spicy as I would have liked.  All in all the experience was very good.  I'll definitely be back to sample more of their menu..."}
{"input": "This target is conveniently located and has what we are looking for.  There is a large parking lot so no need to worry about finding a spot to park.  We can get in and out quickly, and those are the main things I look for at Target."}
{"input": "What a great Happy Hour! Gotta be there!!!"}
{"input": "I have never eaten here always got take out so I can't speak to the ambiance but the food is delicious. \nI always get the veggie pizza. It is always perfect crisp bread topped with light sauce and a host of veggies then cheese. Baked to a perfect ooie gooie crunchy bite every time. And they make the best fries ever!!"}
{"input": "Great food, excellent surface. Many options, so try everything. I highly highly recommend the oysters!"}
{"input": "I was a lucky dog.  Got to go to Modestos 2 times in the same week!  I was worried about Dismoor's departure, but if anything from the customer's perspective it is a better dining experience.  The menu is the same to better.  Tapas come out more timely, and in a more flattering presentation.  Good call by management.     \n\nThis trip I had: Serano wrapped quail egg (It was ok, don't know that I will try again.) boqueron (These are one of my favorites, The combo of olive spread and anchovies on top of bread makes for taste foreworks), olive relleno (delicious,I think these anchovies were fed crack before they died, because they are so addictive), garbanzo spread (apps very good), pepinillo (these were very good), Tigre and shrimp which came with a little freshmade aoili (I could seriously make these my last meal on Earth.  All were awesome to Very good (outside of the quail egg).  Had a side o hummus and orgazmos!"}
{"input": "Yay a new ice cream shop...which has only been open a couple of weeks. The space is small but I like the sparkly booth seats.\n\n The ice cream selection is small but there is definitely something for everyone. I had the peach vanilla and it was fresh and tasty. My only small point was that the peaches bits were large so they got a bit icy to the tooth. But that's probably me just being a weirdo. My friend loved her toasted coconut and it was yummy. \n\nThe business is cash only and supposedly also has snowballs but I didn't see anyone get those while I was there."}
{"input": "99% of the time I love Whole Foods. This week and last week, though, I am quite disappointed. We drive a distance to come to shop here so we always eat from the salad bar. Two weeks in a row, there is no vegan salad dressing available. They usually have 4 vegan options. Last week I didn't discover that they were out until after I had made my salad. When I asked about it, the gentleman said \"we're out til Monday. \" He didn't seem concerned or offer any alternatives so I gave him my salad and left.  This week, still no salad dressing, but I looked before I made my salad, and I purchased my own vegan dressing. Come on Whole Foods. Please don't disappoint me again."}
{"input": "I love that they deliver and the food is pretty good. There is a variety of choices and all reasonably priced. Service is great too!"}
{"input": "I'll admit I messed up and tried to rent a car from another enterprise location and they didn't have a compact car ready for but they gave me an SUV for a discounted rate with no hesitation. Then a few days later when I found out my car would take a week to be done I called to get a compact car due to money issues and they told me to keep the SUV for the compact car rate! Can't beat that! This enterprise location is so nice, quick, and accommodating. When I'm in need of a rental it's the only place I'll go!"}
{"input": "Went there yesterday the combo was almost 10.00 the burger was burned to a crisp,fries and drink were good when I told the cashier she said they all look like that baby so I threw everything including their little red basket in the trash.There was a couple of employees off the clock sitting in the restaurant cursing and laughing so loud that a few couples got up and left.No management or customer service skills in that entire place!Save your money and go and buy some fresh ground meat and make a real burger!"}
{"input": "Great choice in a small shop. Worth the drive. The wine cakes are excellent! Just went here for first time based on yelp reviews and will definitely be going back"}
{"input": "Very disappointed they no longer have the salad & pizza bar! Used to go to other location all the time, moved away & thought they closed. Then I realized they relocated & was excited about having salad there; I loved the salad bar. Was hoping for a piece of pizza for dinner and some salad. Not anymore:-(  Not unless you want to order a whole pizza!"}
{"input": "Great place for breakfast! I had the waffle, which was fluffy and perfect, and home fries which were nice and smashed and crunchy. Friendly waitstaff. Will definitely be back!"}
{"input": "I bought my first road bike from Keswick Cycle. I was extremely pleased with the sales staff and had a great overall experience. Fernando deserves a special mention as he is extremely knowledgeable. His professionalism and excellence enabled me to get a great fitting bike, on time!"}

{"input": "Pan-Latin concept .. I got the chips with trio salsa for appetizer. The short ribs for main course. Short ribs were very tender and tasty. The decor is modern and elegant. Service was beyond great, Rachael was very friendly and attentive."}
{"input": "Such a pleasant surprise! My fiancee and I booked a room through Hotel Tonight at the last minute and were exhausted from a long day of driving on PCH. We were welcomed by very friendly front desk staff, warm fresh chocolate chip cookies, coffee, juice, and candy. It is extremely clean consistently throughout the Inn ( which is very important ).... obviously. They are very accommodating to basic comforts, such as a couples jacuzzi?! Yes we actually had a fully functional, cute jacuzzi in our suite. We also had a fireplace and delicious homemade breakfast INCLUDED, which is obviously a plus in my book. The Inn has very nice Spanish details throughout. Overall, they cover the basics and then some!"}
{"input": "I think the biggest takeaway at Koffee Korner is the value.  Huge portions and low prices.  My buddy and I stopped in for a late breakfast yesterday and had a real nice visit.  We both ordered omelets which were huge.  Each came with a generous portion of hashbrowns and toast.  Throw in coffee and our bill total was only $15!  Food was good, served piping hot and service was friendly.  I had the Western omelet and my buddy had the Farmer's.  We came in 30 minutes before closing but they did not rush us out at all.  Plenty of street parking nearby.  Typical diner atmosphere with counter seating, tables and booths.  Seems like they can fit in a decent crowd on a busy weekend morning.  Not exactly around the \"korner\" from me but worth another visit if we are in Lansdale again."}
{"input": "An amazing dining experience in the sky.  The flat bread with arugula and truffle oil was an awesome app!"}
{"input": "Awesome! Loved this place. Great little breakfast joint easy walk south of route 90. Easy walk from French Quarter and surrounding areas. We got the bananas foster and it was incredible. Great decorations and colorful setting that feels like how you'd expect New Orleans to feel. Highly recommend."}
{"input": "One of our fave St.Pete restaurants. We prefer this location to the Cantina because of the complimentary valet parking. Every dish on the menu is pure perfection. Personal favorite is the Santa Fe chicken. Reservations are a must. It's that good ;)"}
{"input": "Good breakfast place with a varied menu. Service is warm and attentive. Well prepared food at value prices. Clean but not fancy breakfast spot."}
{"input": "This is the best Thai food in St. Louis. Chicken Pad Thai that has never disappointed.. One of the very few restaurants in North County that beats all elsewhere, it's hard to even try other Thai!"}
{"input": "The food is delicious but the service has always been pretty slow if not bad which would be understandable if it was busy it's just usually it's not ."}
{"input": "Came here and was delighted to see nothing but Taiwanese people (Authenticity).\n\nServer asked if I wanted the Taiwanese menu, I asked for the English Menu and went with:\n\nBraised Beef Noodle Soup: 3.5/5 - Recommended by server.  Chewy noodles, beef was lean and tender, soup had nice touch of star anise, but nothing special though.\n\nScallion Pancakes: 4.5/5 - Delicious.  It was nice and crispy on the outside and had a soft, chewy texture on the inside.  Paired well with the dipping sauce.\n\nCrispy Pork Roll: 1.5/5 - Disappointing.  The pork was off. It was a meat mixture that was flavorless.\n\nPopcorn Chicken: 4/5 - Can never go wrong ordering this anywhere.  The basil was awesome. Great portion.\n\nSchezuan Eggplant: 3/5 - Tasted awesome, but was way too oily!  Was not spicy as I thought it would be.\n\nOverall, it was just average.  There is not a lot of places to eat that is close by to the casino (that I know of).  I just wanted to try something new and opted for restaurants outside the casino for a change..."}
{"input": "My all time go to sushi. Love all their rolls and their sake is amazing ! It also comes by the bottle and I always stick it for friends coming over. Service is good and prices great :)"}
{"input": "The food was pretty good..however, the service was almost non-existent.  Maybe we came on an off night but not only did we wait 45 mins for our meal, the table behind us came in after us and got their food way before us.  The waitress walked past us about 50 times before apologizing for the wait.  We were patient and didn't complain, but we felt that the service needs major improvement."}
{"input": "Axis Pizza is very convenient- its 24 hrs and within walking distance of two universities. With that being said, it still manages to produce meals that are surprisingly quality. This place boasts about using fresh ingredients, and you'll see what they mean after your first bite. \n\nThe food is simple, good, and fairly priced. Its my go to for late night meals and it hardly let's me down!"}
{"input": "I really like this place. Josie cut my hair. She was super nice and knew exactly what I wanted. I am a man with long hair, and she did a great job of giving me a nice cut that has some layers and shape to it without it looking too lady-like. Perfect. She gave me samples of the product she used and she told me to bring my dog next time, which was very nice."}
{"input": "The service here is outstanding and done with a smile. The salmon cakes are cooked to perfection, the way you'd remember from your parents kitchen if you grew up in the south. This is a great place to come for breakfast or anytime. The decor is very tasteful and the bar area is very classy. A great gem in St Pete!"}
{"input": "Food was excellent. Service was great. We had the pork belly, the wings and the chicken club and I can honestly say it was the best meal I've had so far in STL. Highly recommend if you're looking for something outside the busy city limits."}
{"input": "As a first time shooter, I really enjoyed this facility. The staff was great- very friendly and always open to giving advice. They even gave us a recommendation for a dinner spot after our shooting session! The prices are reasonable (no time limit per session), the facility is clean and well kept, and the staff seems to really care about your safety and experience. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"input": "Randy was an excellent tour guide with so much historical knowledge of the French Quarter and surrounding areas. The tour was interesting and amusing. He was very able to answer all of our questions and I trust his experience and love of history. Highly recommend magic walking tours..."}
{"input": "Had a business lunch with friends. Service was efficient and friendly. I ordered the pulled pork tamale and it was very good. Everything ordered at the table looked good as well. Good margaritas."}
{"input": "Went here after another restaurant in the area didn't serve us in a timely matter. They sat us right down and it was not very busy around lunch time. Food was good but it took a long time to get it out and the place was dead."}
{"input": "Good service in a relaxed, yet upscale atmosphere.  The Gumbo Ya Ya and bread pudding are highlights."}
{"input": "I have to say that the food here is good; however, the staff/service could be better. My sister and I came here for lunch and a few drinks. My sister ordered a drink off the menu and 10+min later, as we're finishing our lunch, the waitress comes back and says \"sorry, our bartender doesn't know how to make that\" ..... So the bartender doesn't know how to make the drinks listed on the menu? And the 10+mins. it took to tell us that, it could have ben googled and made. I don't want to bash this establishment, but the customer service has always been an issue here. I would recommend continued training to both current and new staffers to improve their level of knowledge and customer service"}
{"input": "Great food, great burgers, great service.... need I say more... just had an Absolutly amazing burger on GF bun best in Tampa\n\n5/18 update.... repeating theme of over cooked burgers, order requests not followed by kitchen and inconsistent food  during different visits.\n\nWas getting used to it but leaving today, another table was talking to waitress that everything was over cooked..an I thought... yep a trend in the wrong direction...\n\nNeed to lower my rating and hope management is reading.\n\nGet your kitchen in order... as I heard my self say I will rethink my next visit..."}
{"input": "The General Tso is definitely better than #1 but the dumplings are far worse.\n\nThe chicken fried rice was decent and so was the lo mein. \n\nI may switch my standard delivery chinese to Royal Chef."}
{"input": "Restaurant has a quaint homely feeling.  Good as an intimate setting and the bread was so yummy. Never tried Afghani food before but now I know I like it and want more. Cheap kebobs for Rittenhouse Square area and attentive service. Waiter checked up on us multiple time while still respecting our need for privacy."}
{"input": "Hypothetically speaking, if I had to swim in any substance in the volume of an Olympic regulation size pool it would have to be the queso from SatCo. \n\nSatCo doesn't do much well besides the queso. The tacos and setup are a slightly strange blend of Tex-Mex, nothing authentic. But damn do people come far and wide for some chips and queso! The patio is a cool place for a quickie after work or a hot lunch time in the summer. And you can't beat the 80's tunes jiving from the patio speakers! The food is expensive for what you get in variety and flavor so I recommend you go for a snack!"}
{"input": "Loved the Bourbon flight! Bartender was attentive, and another bartender offered his opinion on the bourbon when he asked. Very friendly atmosphere."}
{"input": "This is a great neighborhood spot. They have a great bar with a good spread of bourbons. More importantly the crawfish beignet is a must. That dish was on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. It was the tastiest thing I had during my trip in NOLA so far. There was a healthy amount of crawfish in it as well as good sauce and cheese. Although it had jalapeños, it wasn't too spicy. As far as the entree, it was ok. I had the Redfish NOLA. I liked the reddish, I liked the shrimp, and there was a nice amount of crab meat. However, it lacked a good carb (there was like 1 little red potato) and I would have liked a sauce. So although it tasted fine, it wasn't memorable."}
{"input": "Repeat after me, Chicken Basil Ricotta Pizza. My kid suggested we try this place for delivery. We are staying nearby. While it was not 30 minutes or less it was fast. And it was fantastic. I with I had a place like this when I was in college. Fresh, tasty, inventive and I am not a fan of white pizza. The crust was fresh and very good. \n\nGo here, have it delivered send your kid to pick one up. Just do it.\n\nI will be back."}
{"input": "You can't get this quality of BBQ anywhere in the area! Hickory Kitchen is a quaint little BYOB BBQ restaurant right in the center of Doylestown! I highly recommend it!"}
{"input": "Really love their food, IMO the best chinese in chinatown.  Stars of the menu are the hot and sour soup (unlike any that you've had) and the General Tso chicken (again, unlike any that you've had more tempura style than the greasy chunks of fried chicken you get elsewhere).  \n\nIf ordering the General Tso chicken, ask for the sauce on the side, you'll thank me later."}
{"input": "I am searching for a decent Thai place in the city, and we had Basil Spice delivered a few months ago. However, if we try ordering again for delivery, the woman on the phone has said either they aren't offering delivery tonight or that the driver wasn't in our neighborhood (though we had not yet placed an order). Not reliable."}
{"input": "really great food. this place is always packed and has very limited seating so be prepared to wait in line. menu is also small but it extremely worth the wait. highly recomend going"}
{"input": "I really love this place! The food is very good and fresh. The service is usually good, but they could be a little more friendly. The place is small and can get tight. It seems that it is always empty or packed! The lunch special is a very good deal!!! They have a lot of choices for vegetarians! I love the coconut soup, the curries with tofu and coconut soup here."}
{"input": "Great breakfast.  Would definitely come again.  Highly recommend.    Next to Carrollton Market.  \nHad the Southern breakfast.  Basic but excellent.  Nothing pretentious, just good."}
{"input": "Best shrimp and grits I ever had! I had read reviews before going and some were negative. Decided to try anyway and glad I did. The wait staff was wonderful and so was our dinner. Wine list is somewhat limited but had a glass of viognier with dinner. Yum!  They're a little overpriced but I would go there again"}
{"input": "We loved this place. The catfish was perfectly fried, and I can't stop thinking about the crabmeat omelet and how long it will be before I can have another one (quite a while, sadly). Service is on the laid-back side, so just go with it. Enjoy a cup of the excellent coffee or a glass of strong iced tea and soak up the experience."}
{"input": "This place is still unbeatable. Inexpensive, INCREDIBLE-tasting, whole-ingredient ice cream is where it's at. \n\nThe staff is great and the portions are enormous. Love these guys!"}
{"input": "I love this crazy chicken.  Probably the cleanest, freshest and friendliest location I have been too in Reno.  Customers are usually interesting species , but even when it's busy and annoying they handle it very well."}
{"input": "Finally, Berlin's Doner is adding some much needed excitement to the dismal food selection on the South Side. Both the beef-lamb and chicken are excellent whether in a sandwich, wrap, or salad."}
{"input": "It's been 10 years since I've been to a Shoney's, and I'll never eat at a Shoney's again. The people working there are nice and I honestly feel for them. The food was disappointing, though not inedible. The $11.99 buffet is a poor excuse for a buffet, we might have done better to just order something from the menu. I went with my wife and two kids on a Saturday evening and although they didn't appear to be that busy, it took 15 minutes to get a table and another 20 minutes to pay at the counter once we were done eating. \n\nI don't really enjoy eating at Waffle House, but I would have had a much better experience at the Waffle House across Briley  I'm sure."}
{"input": "I love Village Whiskey, it's just a shame it's always so crowded. The bar snacks and their signature burger are delicious. I'm bummed they did away with the warm pretzels, but oh well. The whiskey selection is extensive and the bar tenders are very helpful and knowledgeable. But be warned: their whiskeys by the glass are definitely a bit overpriced."}
{"input": "This review is for the racquetball courts only. \n\nI only give two stars because upkeep is needed on these courts. I've been twice and there was so much grit  and unevenness on the floor from cracks that I was afraid of rolling my ankle and doing serious damage to myself. In a sport like racquetball you really need at least a level court that you won't slip and slide on. I also noticed a lot of trash in them too, like a pregnancy test. For such a nice park as Francis is, I expected better.\n\nIf you live on the Hill or South Hampton area, go to Tilles Park first for Racquetball, that's my number two spot for RB behind Forest Park."}
{"input": "Every time I stop by an Italian restaurant, I forget they're there to feed the starving family in you. My gosh, my meal was never ending. Alfredo sauce was pretty good. Standard to what I expect my white sauce to be -- rich and creamy. I also ordered a side of the meatball because it seems to be their specialty. Cooked through without being too tough. The meat tasted well seasoned without overpowering and despite the clashing sauce, was pretty good to eat together. Blasphemous maybe, but I enjoyed it. I will stop by for a meal next time I'm in STL."}
{"input": "Ambience OK, too bad stuck in a mall in New Hope.  They were very understaffed (which thankfully they kept apologizing for) so there service was definitely slow, however very very pleasant.  We definitely felt it was worth the wait!  Vegetable Samosas were delicious, chicken were slightly dry.  I ordered chicken tikka masala which was so flavorful and rich and my husband had the chicken tagine...amazing!  Has the feeling of a place where \"you get what you get and you don't get upset\" but when you get it, it is really out of this world!  Loved the mix of cuisines, just enough choices on the menu.  Restaurant is BYOB so we were unprepared, but we will be back!"}
{"input": "My husband and I are not \"spring chickens\", but we love to Par-Tee. The server immediately welcomed us and asked about our drink preferences.  He was very knowledgeable and helpful. The beer selection was wonderful, the liquor selection divine.  The bar food, even though it was a small selection, was excellent. I had never wanted to try pork bellies (the name turned me off.) Dan ordered it, I tried it,and we now have a convert.  WE highly recommend their pork belly sliders! I hope they continue to add a few more delicious tapas.  These folks have it together and are very engaging.  We'll be back often."}
{"input": "If you want shotty work and bad attitudes, this is the place for you. Mediocre for toes and poor for fingers. And don't try to make any suggestions or corrections without getting an attitude in returned and then talked about in another language."}
{"input": "Just order a few things for take out, the people doing take out were amazing. Very friendly even though it was crazy busy. I popped over to the bar for a drink while I waited and ordered a gin and tonic.... The girl gives me one without a lime... Which I then ask her for. She gives me a couple in a glass, and I squeeze them and ask her for a napkin. She wasn't super friendly...Really... For $8 you would think they would finish making the drink for you?  Food and take out service 4.5 stars, bar 2 stars."}
{"input": "I just got a manicure, which turned out really well.  The shop is really well decorated, super cute! The tables have heat lamps built into them, and one for your feet as well.  They have plenty of colors for nails in gel and regular. \n\nThe only thing I didn't like was the pushing of other services. I was offered a polish change on my toes, gel polish, eyebrow wax (mine are so blonde you cant see them), and even a haircut. (After I mentioned I got my hair cut yesterday. \n\nNeedless to say, I will return."}
{"input": "I visited Jake's for the first time after learning that the small diner I used to go to in Delaware as a kid had become a franchise. I was so excited to experience the delicious burgers and fries that I craved as a kid.\n\nI walked into the establishment and was frankly unimpressed by the ambiance. The restaurant was moderately clean and very open. The menu actually reminded my of a Five Guys. You get to choose your own toppings (all free) to put on 1, 2, or 3 patties.\n\nI ordered the regular cheeseburger with a ton of toppings and a regular size french fry to share with my boyfriend. The burgers were delicious. The bread was soft and tasty and the burgers were succulent and juicy. The fries were disappointing. McDonalds fries taste better and usually aren't even as cold as Jake's were.\n\nMan oh man, Jake's. I'll go back for the burgers, maybe, but I definitely will stick to the original location for a better experience."}
{"input": "Stayed down the road from this place and walked past it a few times a day without trying it -- glad I finally did! Incredible veggie tacos! They had two kinds and I tried one of each with their hottest sauce -- no regrets. Very affordable and quick as well. Give it a try!"}
{"input": "Wanted to follow up the review I wrote in Sept. Everything has been great. I've not been disappointed with any lunch or dessert we've gotten there. My only issue previously was with the fries and that must have been an anomaly because since then they have been uniformly great. The sandwiches are fab and as my daughter would say the desserts are to die for. Plus the family that owns it are great people. I highly recommend this south side gem."}
{"input": "Why did it take me so long to return? Oh gods of HCV, i've missed you so!  I came here for a quick bite after shopping on Walnut.  It was peak lunch time and they were busy! Be patient, it's definitely worth the wait.  I ordered the \"chicken sandwich\".  Anytime i can enjoy a delicious sandwich is a winner to me.  Do yourself a favor and grab a sandwich, get a groothie, and walk to the park and enjoy. Your welcome!"}
{"input": "LOVE. This tiny place is consistent & personal. The staff is always prompt & very helpful. The quality & pride in food is my favorite part. They are definitely accomedating if you have any preferences. I had only two places I would eat sushi at while pregnant (sparingly) - this was one of them. The out door seating is a massive bonus on a nice day!"}
{"input": "The shrimp poboy was out of this world. And the white chocolate bread pudding was delicious. There's no drive-in option: take out only."}
{"input": "Best burger I've had in a long time, loved it. Fries were great too. Went with 5 friends and everyone loved their food- chicken cordon blue, sliders, ginger chicken lettuce wrap, grilled romaine... all of it. Friendly wait staff and good drinks!!"}
{"input": "Don't go here. They gave me grief over the groupon then didn't bother to actually change my oil filter or tell me that they hadn't changed it so I drove 5k miles on an old filter. Crappy customer service, rude attitude, find somewhere better."}
{"input": "The price point is amazing. The size of the plates are just right! We had the squash dumplings, brisket slider, collard greens, and hot chicken - all worth trying. Loved the Mobile Mule cocktail."}
{"input": "What a great addition to the Funk Zone!  Grab a bite, grab some tastings, life is good. Right next door to the Santa Barbara Wine Collective, in fact it actually shares the same tables.  We had a fabulous savory croissant."}
{"input": "This is as authentic as you can get in Nashville. The feel of the restuarant is like an establishment in Tokyo. The sushi and other dishes are fresh and delicious. Not to mention they have a half priced sushi menu everyday of the week. I recommend Ninki to anyone who enjoys fresh and delicious Japanese cuisine."}
{"input": "This is above average bar food. They have something for everyone, from pizza slices to pasta entrees. The take out beer selection is awesome, if you can't find something here, you have a problem."}
{"input": "I luv coming here. If I am on my lunch hour , they are very good about getting the food and my check out so I am not late .\nI had the Banzai Burger. Done the right way and it was yummy. I also like the loyalty program. Every time I come I try a new item and I have not been disappointed yet !\nStaff is friendly"}
{"input": "Surprising good bagels from this unassuming shop on the north end of Lambertville. \nVery friendly owner.  Decent coffee.  \nDefinitely a keeper."}
{"input": "GREAT place to stay! My husband and I spent our anniversary night here and the front desk (Jake) sent up a complimentary bottle of champagne and anniversary card. We stopped at the bar on our way out to dinner and the bartender gave us 2 drinks on the house as well. Great service didn't end at checkout... 2 weeks later my husband realized he left his eyeglasses at the hotel....we called and were transferred to Craig in Loss prevention who said that a pair of eyeglasses were reported found and that they would mail them out to us immediately free of charge. This by far is the best service we've experienced from our travels in the Northeast!! Clean, modern, and excellent service."}
{"input": "Western cycle is a huge store and sells everything to do with bikes. They've got your $150 kids' bikes with training wheels and your $5,000 racing bikes for triathletes. The staff are knowledgeable, and they've got a mixture of older, more mature and younger people, all of whom seem into biking. \n\nThe one aspect I've enjoyed most about coming here over the years is how they keep returned, out-of-package stuff in a drawer and will sell it to you on discount. I once got $200 pedals for $60 just 'cause they were sitting in a drawer without their proper package. The guys work really hard here to keep their customers loyal, and it works. They're honest and well-trained. You're never left wandering without help. This and United Cycle are pretty much the only two bike places I'll shop."}
{"input": "Eh, disappointing food. I saw this place got busy during lunch hour so gave a shot during weekday lunch. \nPlace was busy and I saw people getting salad with salmon so I got that one as well. \nMy salmon was dry... And lukewarm. Definitely didn't enjoyed my protein. I had only one visit so I can't speak for all but my salad wasn't fresh either that day. Sandwiches on other tables looked good though. That was my first and only trip to Marathon."}
{"input": "We are choice rewards members and this by far is the worst property that we have ever stayed at and we travel a lot.  I wasted my reward points staying there because their pictures of the property were so deceiving. There was mold all over the bathroom light and ceiling.  Chunks of drywall missing from the walls.  The bathroom smelled like urine.  Their were people smoking,  screaming and running down the halls way after 10 pm and then back at it at 7am. We were told that we were lucky to get the room we got because they were booked up but the parking lot was half empty. Very disappointed and a waste of points."}
{"input": "Best ice cream in New Orleans!  I personally love the chocolate peanut butter and fudge."}
{"input": "We had a great experience enjoying happy hour here! Vaughn and Mark are so kind, we will absolutely be back to get that same service. It's truly one of a kind. The free appetizer was awesome and the slot machines at the bar brought us luck. What a fun happy hour with amazing service!! It's a must!"}
{"input": "I had dinner about a week or so with a few colleagues. Going to any steakhouse, you have to expect to drop a good bit of money. \nI got the porterhouse, and it was cooked perfectly at medium temperature. \n\nThis gets a 3 star - only relative to the other steakhouses in Philly. Philly is all about restaurants with personality and Morton's just lacks that, though I know this is a chain. Morton's should consider restyling their layout. When we got there, it was just a huge empty room with a bunch of tables. There were probably 4 tables full max, which makes the restaurant look empty and somewhat undesirable. \n\nAll in all, you will get a good steak here, but for the price you're paying, you could get a good steak AND better ambiance elsewhere."}
{"input": "Good price, great location and good accommodations with decently sized rooms. The bed is pretty firm though and the sheets are super rough but overall, I would stay here again!"}
{"input": "Last time I ate at La Casona (and it's been about 2 years now) I ordered the Pollo relleno a la casona and it made me incredibly sick. I had ordered mofongo in previous ocassions and it was good. Service was very slow too and it seems it hasn't change based on recent reviews I have read on Yelp."}
{"input": "This place is over priced, it was totally empty on a Friday night at 9:30.... Disappointed that I didn't look at the menu before coming here and just looked at the rating. The quality of the food is completely off. They didn't give us utensils to begin with. I am disappointed."}
{"input": "Was in town for the weekend and after a red eye flight I took a stroll to Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell. I stumbled upon this place and decided to check it out. It was a Friday lunch visit and they were moderately busy but I had no problems getting service, and water. It is a nice atmosphere. The views from this place was great as you can see the \"city\" action from within. I was a walk-in. I did not have reservations."}
{"input": "Hands down the best pizza in south county. You have to try the pinwheels they are awesome little rolls of goodness. Stephanie is always friendly and helpful."}
{"input": "Ate dinner at Pinocchio's.  It was ok.  Service was good and they refunded us the price of the shrimp because we thought the shrimp tasted a little too fishy.  I had the lite plate.  It was ok.  Nothing to write home about.  He had the fresh raviolis which I thought was better than my dinner.  We ordered the kids pasta with white sauce and that seemed pretty good he ate it all.  \nThe drinks were ok.  We had a coronarita, call it a turborita,  and a top shelf bloody Mary. Prices are middle of the road.  About 10 to 15 bucks for adult dinner.  Desert was awesome we shared a big slice of mud pie!  Ate half of the desert and took the other half home."}
{"input": "Nice, rivlas Grand Central Station in NY & Union Station in DC"}
{"input": "Timpano's is a great place for Sunday afternoon brunch or dinner. It can be a little pricy, depending on what you want to order, but the food is delicious. One of my favorite things for brunch is the crab cake Benedict. YUM. A few nights ago we went for dinner and I had the shrimp fra diavolo (or something like that). It had a delicious rosa cream sauce that packed the perfect amount of heat and shrimp that were cooked just right. No matter when we go we always order the fried mozzarella appetizer. It comes with one of the best marinara dipping sauces I've ever had. \n\nThe service is always fantastic as well."}
{"input": "This place gets two stars from me only because the gravy fries were good. Their sandwiches are awful. Thick slabs of badly sliced, tough, dry meat....gross. I made the mistake of ordering their pork sandwich once and it was inedible. I tried to bite into the sandwich and couldn't even bite through because of how tough and rubbery the pork was. I don't understand why they slice the meat the way they do but it makes for a disgusting sandwich. The people raving on how good this place is are just locals who have never had anything better. You're better off going to Wawa for a sandwich. Seriously. It will at least be edible."}
{"input": "We love Beach Place! Right on the gulf, walking distance to lots of shops and restaurants, nice pool. This year we were disappointed in the condo we had (210) and wouldn't rent it again but otherwise the location is perfect!"}
{"input": "We recently moved within walking distance of the store.  On my first visit, I found the employees to be no so friendly.  They didn't make eye contact, say hello, can I help you, nothing!  I brushed it off as just a bad day.  Today I went back and that will be my last time.... The deli lady and the cashier were the only employees that spoke to me or make eye contact for that matter.  The people that look like managers don't smile or speak.  The bag boy was hanging on the coke cooler door when I went to the register.  He piled can goods on foil pans that I bought and when I asked him to move them he said \"well I didn't bend them\"!  No one offered to take my groceries to my car either.  I'll drive the extra miles to shop at the Publix on Alderman and Alt. 19 in Palm Harbor.  Those people ALWAYS go out of their way to be friendly."}
{"input": "Have gone to this location several times and am always impressed. The staff is always super polite and welcoming even when it is a busy weekday lunch hour. They even offer samples if you're having trouble deciding. The bakery area is always well stocked. Some favorites of Panera in general include: black bean soup, vegetable soup with pesto, Asian chicken salad, Thai chicken salad, tuna salad sandwich, Cuban panini, Napa almond chicken salad sandwich. I recently tried a soba noodle bowl with chicken and it was yummy. Perfect size with a side of baguette. And I absolutely love the strawberry poppyseed chicken salad. Wish it was around all year!! Losing one star because it is always freezing in here despite the time of year. Not a comfortable eating atmosphere."}
{"input": "The filet mignon is good. Always cooked well when I order it. The banana foster is also very yummy. They cook it table side. Overall, not a bad place."}
{"input": "We really enjoyed our dinner here since we are tapas fans.  The food was delicious all the way around.  The lamb chops were so so but fried cauliflour, albondigas, mojo tacos, and manchego cheese were all great.  Atmosphere was a bit crowded and we were seated by the door on a cold night so that could have been better.  Waitress was helpful and attendant.  We will be back."}
{"input": "Went there with some friends and I really enjoyed the atmosphere... My biggest problem was they can't make drinks! Stick  with the basic drinks..."}
{"input": "Really the best of Edsville for my $$.  I go all the time.  The staff and menu will guide you to sure fire bets but the staple is the drunken noodle. I like the noodle dishes over the rice dishes but a little tip they will typically convert stir fry to noodles which is a must with the bomb stir fry!   Try their homemade soda, I like the orange.  And spring rolls for an app.  Love the new digs.  My go-to when my out of town friends venture to IL."}
{"input": "It's been a few years since I've been here. I was impressed that they had little tvs in the exam rooms for the patients. Now I realize 1. you can't really watch tv during dental work and 2. maybe it's a \"perk\" since the prices are so high.\n\nI originally went to get a cleaning/exam but was told I needed several inlays which, of course, weren't covered by insurance and were very expensive. The dental work was done well(no complaints there) but it's very expensive and was possibly unnecessary."}
{"input": "We have great food every time we are here. Great milkshakes, ice cream, Chicago dogs, and cheese fries. Super affordable and delicious!"}
{"input": "We have used this company and referred clients several times...easy to work with, professional drivers and great cars and service..."}
{"input": "Came in at 6:30 pm on Labor Day for dinner on my way home.  We were sat almost instantly and greeted kindly by one of the managers.  Our server was also very friendly and efficient.  In all fairness, it wasn't overly busy, but still there were other customers around.  The menu was great and the food was as well.  The calamari appetizer was wonderful.  My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly to temp.  Salad was very nice as well.  Hubby's seafood platter was pretty nice but he said the fish-n-chips (fish) portion had a different taste, coming off as a little strange to him from what was expected.  Mostly he enjoyed the meal though and was not complaining...only answered me when asked.   The cocktail sauce here is quite tasty as well.   As usual, the Claim Jumper restaurant is beatiful inside and out.    Overall,  we were very pleased with the whole experience."}
{"input": "This is a very mediocre place.  The location itself is in the same dirty strip mall as Mozzarella Pizza. The inside has that \"we don't really care about the looks\" feel to it.  It's not dirty, per se.  It just doesn't look very clean.  Everything looks like its falling apart.  It probably gets its business from suburbanites like me craving what we think of as Chinese food.\n\nAll that said, the food I had was palatable.  Nothing outstanding or amazing: it was just all right.  I won't recommend against it, but it's nothing that you would think of as that great either."}
{"input": "Chargrilled oysters were everything. I also had the Cajun red fish. They don't have many healthy options. Only green beans, that looked like edemame. I'm allergic to soy so I didn't take that chance. \n\nStill overall the food was great and staff was nice."}
{"input": "The food is excellent. The customer service and quantity over time has continued to go down. I've been going to this place every couple weeks for two years. The portions over time have continued to gradually get smaller and smaller. I commented on this, because my take out dish is now to the point where it is less then half full when I order, when it used to go to the top. When I commented on this I was told I was wrong.  I proceeded to explain my case. I was told if I didn't want to take the food, I didn't have to pay for it. I said ok, and was the berated for not taking the food I ordered. \n\nLong story short, these people have lost my business. I am not going back."}
{"input": "Went here as a last resort and was pleasantly surprised. It's fairly dark inside but is cozy, and would be good in the winter. I ordered the French dip and I was so hungry I gobbled it down. It was good, probably not the best I've had but good. And the clam chowder is really good, even the waitress was saying people from the east coast comment on how good it is in the Midwest. The waitress was great and attentive and personable, and we didn't have to wait too long!"}
{"input": "The food was good, not great, the atmosphere was fun and lvively. Drinks were large and wine list was pleasing."}
{"input": "Changing this to a 1 after I just had to pay $10 to park. Seriously?   Not like they aren't making any money on anything else in there....."}
{"input": "What a fun little find. Busy first thing in the morning! Our server was spunky and fun, just the right amount of perfect service. \n\nMy husband was starving and grumpy after our red eye flight in from Cali, this was the perfect meal to perk him right up! \n\nI ordered plain crepes with powdered sugar, they were thick unlike an ordinary crepe which was a little weird but, none the less delicious. I topped them off with some cinnamon-cream syrup. My husband enjoyed a meaty man omelet with a side of cinnamon and sugar pancakes. \n\nThe portions are just right. Totally worth the extra 10 min drive from the airport."}
{"input": "Good for the price, nice service. Seafood is pretty fresh, other than that nothing really impressive. Prime rib is good. Crab legs modest. Long line waiting around 8 pm."}
{"input": "The service was great and the food was good too. I didn't want soup with my grilled cheese since it was such a hot day...so they made me a second grilled cheese!\n\nI didn't try the coffee but had a couple of the smoothies (PB&J, Island Espresso) which were really tasty. \n\nThe atmosphere is good-open space-makes it feel larger than it is. And there is a tiny puppy chilling here too."}
{"input": "This place is great, even for vegetarians.  The food is fresh and delicious.  The sauces are fantastic.  The staff are courteous and helpful.  My daughter and son-in-law live in nearby Lansdale and it seems as if we stop here for a meal at least once every time we visit them."}
{"input": "I love driving on the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. Every time I go up to NJ, I make sure I take this bridge. The view from the bridge is amazing. I love the waterfront PA/NJ scenery. It's best to have EZ Pass during busy times. The EZ pass makes getting through the tolls a lot smoother. If you are riding across the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, enjoy the waterfront view."}
{"input": "Poor service to start off with. Server was abrupt and seemed to be kind of snippy I guess you could say. Waited 25 minutes for food and when it arrived it was luke warm at best. Something we had never seen before but they would not let a couple pay individually. There were 3 couples in our party. Safe to say we will not be going back."}
{"input": "Come and order the Shark Attack.  Their presentation is delightful and witty.  The drink is tasty.  Otherwise the bar is packed and kind of frat-ish."}
{"input": "Never mind the fact that I was the only female in the joint all night long, this is a fine establishment that makes me ooze with positive verbiage. Excellent food, service, and even better prices. Best on 2nd Street by a long shot."}
{"input": "This is the best Auto shop I've been to. Their prices are great but their service and quality of work is better. It is the only shop I trust for my 4Runner. I've also taken my fiancé's Mini Cooper there for oil changes. The shop has a quick turnaround but does tons of business so I'd recommend you call them before dropping off your vehicle if you can.  They never do work or buy parts without calling you to get consent; unlike other auto shops that will do work unauthorized and expect you to pay to fix the \"pixie-dust unicorn O2 sensor\"* that wasn't broken in the first place or that you didn't want to get fixed at the moment.\n\n\n*pixie dust O2 sensor\" is purely a hyperbole but you get my point."}
{"input": "I don't know what so special about this place. I had classic chicken parm. It was okay, but I had expected something more than ok."}
{"input": "My crew and I absolutely love this place. We frequent here on Thursday nights for Quizzo. Delicious, reasonably priced food, good atmosphere, and great service. My only criticism is that they don't offer a bar menu. It would be nice to see the different beers on tap and cocktails offered. Other than that, a great, local bar!"}
{"input": "Everything about this place is average. The food is just ok, the service sort of depends on your luck - sometimes good sometimes not so good. \n\nHad the drunken noodles once and Thai green curry once. Both were average."}
{"input": "Food is good, but don't try to ever call in for takeout.  Every time they put you on hold and don't come back."}
{"input": "Before you judge the appearance, remember it's a thrift store.\n\nThis place is awesome if you hunt for books, magazines, & music.\n\nNothing I bought had frayed edges, or missing pages; the price was better than reasonable, is down-right cheap.\n\nThe staff is constantly organizing shelves, & rotating product.\n\nI would definitely suggest a visit."}
{"input": "Best Indian around by far. Reasonably priced, good service, clean and great food. Try Ekta vegetables and the lamb korai. Yum!"}
{"input": "Foodie Call: always there when I turn around, at a cool dive bar. Or my homebase for bama gamedays. The burgers are always the  best. My boyfriend and I like to split them just as a nice hearty snack. Just tell them to cut it in half if you are splitting a burger with someone. I've had the #1 and it's always amazing and we just had the jalapeño burger bc my bf loves spicy things and it's his bday and omg this burger is also perfect. I'm not surprised. I probably wouldn't have been able to eat a whole one because it's so deliciously spicy and I can't handle much spice. But it was still extremely tasty, like always!"}
{"input": "Love the food here and the Fire and Ice drink.  I've been here twice for food and once just for drinks at the bar.  Wait staff and bar tender were all extra friendly and very knowledgable of the menu and made great recommendations."}
{"input": "Reasonably priced spot with good beer and food selection. I tried the PO Boy with sauté onions and red peppers - food was good and the fries were great (note don't use ketchup as they are tasty by itself)."}
{"input": "We did the regular tasting menu with a few bottles of wine--possibly the best meal I've ever had.  The chef clearly focuses on great textures and on selecting a few key ingredients with strong flavors in their own right (the pigs feet meatballs were outstanding).  The service was absolutely perfect and much appreciated having just eaten at another place where I felt rushed through my dinner.  Absolutely excellent!"}
{"input": "Picked Luke's for brunch on a Monday. Located in the business district you can come casual. Highly recommend the fried chicken with red beans and rice; it's like a spoonful of heaven in your mouth; smoky, bacon, maple, Tabasco, crunchy chicken skin all merge together to create an orgasmic effect. My wife's gumbo was a good authentic New Orleans gumbo, with a caramel like brown rue. The okra was a little stringy. We enjoyed a dozen oysters with our friends, they were awesome- fresh, clean, light smell of the sea, and shucked properly. All in all would go back to enjoy more!"}
{"input": "This restaurant was pretty good; i'll admit it! I went here in the late evening with my boyfriend to have a nice date! He insisted on us ordering a milkshake and i'm SO GLAD that he did. The milkshake was probably one of the best ones i've had in my lifetime. The food was pretty good and so was the service but something was a little off. I couldn't tell what it was but i just got a really strange vibe from the restaurant. Maybe i'm just being crazy!"}
{"input": "BEST haircut I've ever had!  I recently moved to the Reno/Sparks area from the San Francisco area, and was a tad bit nervous about finding a new hairdresser.  I searched the internet, and decided on Shearz and specifically asked for Katie based on Yelp reviews.  My experience exceeded my expectations.  Katie was so patient listening to my concerns, but beyond that, gave me the best haircut ever.  I've paid three times the price at some 'boutique' salons in the Bay area, and have never received a better haircut.  This is the place to go!"}
{"input": "1. Cultural\n2. Filling portions\n3. Don't judge by the storefront\n\nConsumed: \nLamb kabob\nFish kabob\n\nHole in the wall? Whatever. It's so good! This was my first time trying afghani food and it was a very pleasant experience. I really like the ambiance. The cultural decorations are pretty fun. The artwork is pretty, if you have an appreciation for that kind of stuff. This restaurant is like a mini museum! \n\nThe food was descent. The fish was light and yummy. It was too dry. I used the spicy, tangy sauce to add a little more flavor. The lamb was also pretty decent. It was nicely flavored and the gamey taste was subtle. \n\nGOOD EXPERIENCE!"}
{"input": "I like Yelp for this very reason. New place. Decent buzz. Needed to try it myself. That said, I feel it's an ok start to a place that has potential. My biggest concern is that the dishes are small. Also, a bit on the pricey side. I had the cauliflower pizza. It was good but waaaaaay too small for $8. I had the \"zoodles\". Which was a Greek salad made out of zucchini \"noodles\". It was good but pricey at $8 as well. I feel this place could be good over time but it felt sort of, I don't know.....rushed? Add more food for the money or drop the prices at least $1 across the board."}
{"input": "My absolute favorite cafe in the city. Their black and white latte is probably the best I've ever had (not too sweet and just the right amount of foam), soups are always really good (even for non-soup people) and there's just a lot of space to do work. The noise level is perfect, the music is at a perfect level, and I always enjoy when patrons bring their dogs. I'll keep giving them my business for as long as I can."}
{"input": "Sitting at Jiffy Lube getting an oil change making me think of my car... Which makes me think of Carl's.\n\nThe owner's name is Mike and him and I go way back. One of the few people I still like after giving them about $5k. \n\nThis man will tell you like it is. What you can wait to fix, what you need to fix, and when it might be time to throw in the towel (he told me if I need another big repair I should part ways with my VW).\n\nHe truly has done all the major repairs on my car.\n\nAnd he is a really nice guy. He once did a free oil change because I had just spent so much. Last time? I had him replace the wires, coils, and shock plugs in my car and it was raining outside. I live about a couple miles away and Mike offered me a ride. When I turned him down he gave me his own umbrella. \n\nWhich is pretty fabulous service. Service you probably wouldn't get anywhere else."}
{"input": "They have great prices if you order family style. We tried the pot roast and it was just as good carry out as it would have been at the restaurant. They packaged everything nicely and it stayed warm after the 30 min car ride. There was definitely enough for a family of 4. The green beans were amazing! I would definitely recommend. It's nothing special, just a good family restaurant"}
{"input": "Maybe I just had bad luck at this property but I am a SPG gold member... quickly approaching platinum and made a reservation at this property. I payed a good amount for my room and when I asked for a larger room they told me they where all the same. I asked did every room have adjoining doors and was told yes. I then told the front desk clerk that I could hear EVERYTHING going on next door including sneezing and even AC talking on CNN 360 very clearly. He told me to come down and get a new key and move to a room there was nobody in. They did not offer to bring me a key or help me move. When I got to the lobby the line was at least 10 people deep and there was only ONE person there. I just gave up and dealt with the noise and a few hours later they finally turned off the TV and I could sleep.  There is nothing fancy about this hotel and the service for sure needs improvement!"}
{"input": "Food-4\nService-5\nAmbiance-4\n\nWhen everyone of the 16 guests leave happy, restaurant needs to be commended.\nOur glasses were constantly refilled, we were being checked on from time to time for our drinks, appetizer and entree- full marks on service. \nI the flip side, The food is brought out as it gets ready and no separate checks are entertained.\n\nFor appetizer we got the combination platter with hummus, red pepper hummus and eggplant mash. Also got falafel and saganaki. The falafel was a little underdone and hummus tasted very different from usual. Definitely the cuisine is not authentic Greek but unique adaptation.\n I was satisfied with my blacked Tilapia and DH got lamb chops. On the table, people loved the lamb gyros, lamb kabobs and pesto pasta. The chicken Gyros were very ordinary.\nThe dessert of bread pudding was stellar though and my cocktail Medusa was nice and sweet although weak.\n\nThere was a pleasant belly dancer who kept us entertained.\n\nWe will be back.."}
{"input": "The place where franklin's stands now, has been playing russian roulette as a lot of earlier tenants have come and gone, but i hope franklin's is here to stay ! It's quite a laid back neighborhood  place with bunch of screens where u can even catch ur favorite teams play.\n\nI don't know how long the deal is gonna last , but franklin's has the best happy hour deals on this side of the Schuylkill ! A lot of juicy 0.25 cent wings we gorged upon ferociously whilst trying to pay attention to the bingo numbers being called out in the background , on once a Wednesday. \n\nWith a tonne of seating and an uber friendly staff  that goes along with a solid beer choices and a bunch of well drinks on the cheap , Franklin's certainly makes for one helluva night out in the burbs of east falls ..."}
{"input": "We ventured over here on Friday at noon and the wait was about 30 minutes. Luckily the line moves fast and they provide self-serve complimentary coffee outside. I thought that was a nice little touch.\nEveryone here is extremely friendly! Our waitress came over to our table right when we were seated and made some delicious recommendations. Since we were starving and standing in line, we already knew exactly what we wanted. I ordered the raspberry delight, which was basically three rolled up pancakes with raspberry, powdered sugar and whipped cream. Wow and add that maple syrup to it, everything about those pancakes was perfect. It was hard to stop eating them!\nOnly disappointment was the bacon. It was barely crispy! I feel like it is hard to mess up bacon, especially at a breakfast joint, but they sure did and it was definitely not worth $4. Also, note that you pay at the counter once you're done."}
{"input": "Just personal preference i guess but there was too much sauce so it was all goopy and too overpowering of a flavour. ."}
{"input": "The food was good and the staff was nice, but we arrives at the start of the breakfast rush and it took a long time to get food to the table."}
{"input": "What negative thing can I say? Absolutely nothing! We walked right in and was seated right away! Anthony was simply amazing! He explained the menu very well and made us feel as family! The apple old fashion was simply heavenly! We had the steak and pork chop with twice baked potatoes. The steak melted in your mouth and the pork chop was out of this world! I can't say enough how awesome this place is! We definitely will be back!"}
{"input": "What the deuce?? I've never been to a vietnamese place that doesn't serve pho!...or vietnamese food for that matter. \n\nTheir 'special' vietnamese soup is actually just wonton soup with a some chicken in there.  The broken rice dish which is also another staple of vietnamese food was closer to chinese food since the 'spring rolls' were more like a 'chicken roll' consistency that you get in dim sum. We also tried the pad thai noodles, which really was bland lo mein...but hey it works when you're hungry.\n\nService is actually pretty good and the location is really convenient. I would say come here if you want to try a weird chinese version of 'vietnamese' food."}
{"input": "I have taken my small pomimo here 4 times and before I hadn't had any complaints. I had set up an appointment on Thursday which I had walked to and the power was out but they still told me to keep my dog there. 30 mins after being home I get a call saying they can't do it and that we need to reschedule. I rescheduled for Saturday morning, two hours they call me tell me to come get him. I paid 60$ and his haircut is literally a hack job, i could of done something similar with my boyfriends trimmers! I called to inform them and they were not picking up my call.. What a waste of my Christmas money!"}
{"input": "Super good food here.  I am pretty new to Khmer food, i can't express that this is amazing and the portion is family style.  So if you order too much.. prepare to bring it home and eat it again!  \n\nHome made food here may take a bit to prepare depending on what you get, but it's worth it as it is made fresh on most items.  just BYOB and enjoy the food with your families/friends"}
{"input": "Claire does an amazing job!! Thanks so much for an enjoyable time with family, excellent drinks, and incredible food!"}
{"input": "Great food and drink. The staff are always friendly and attentive! This is one of my favorite places to go!"}
{"input": "Soooo good.  The dishes were light, fresh, and had really excellent mixes of flavors and textures.  The fried cheese (I forget what all the dishes were called) was great, salty and a little crispy over a chopped salad that had a little mint and cilantro in it I think.  The yogurt-lemon mousse was a perfect summer dessert - very lemony which I love.  The waiter was nice and outside seating is always appreciated.  Stop at the foodery on your way over and mix a six or bring a bottle of wine.  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 b/c it was a bit pricey, but the lunch menu looked good (and cheaper)."}
{"input": "Ok, only 8 taps, but they support AZ beer! All 8 are AZ beers! \nGreat service, and the location is in the Beer Triangle! \nWOB is next door, Club Congress is across the street, and Borderlands is a short walk away!\nAlso Barrio is a short and I mean short drive away!\nGreat place, cozy atmosphere and great beer!"}
{"input": "I took my car after an accident and Joey took care of everything for me , he called the insurance for me and fixed the car within one week.  I am very satisfied with the service. My car looks great again.  Very much recommend."}
{"input": "lit!!!!! just wanna give a shoutout to my g, kyle. he was such a chill waiter and deserves a raise or somethin. he recommended me the honey hot sauce and it was some of the best hot sauce i had eaten in ages. kyle from milk and honey changed my life and i will forever owe him. also the biscuits brought me to heaven. i didn't even order one i just stole from my friends but they were just that. good. so yeah def come here and ask about kyle. tell him i miss him and that i hope we get reunited soon."}
{"input": "Coco Nara coals. Ice chambers. KM hookahs. As someone who prefers to smoke at home because hookah bars tend to cut corners, I was shocked by the options and quality Aladdin's had to offer and at an extremely reasonable price. This is hands down the best place for hookah I've been to outside of my home, and my boyfriend, a certifiable expert, agreed. We got guava mixed with mint in a pineapple bowl with an ice chamber hose. The blend was great, and the coals were replaced by a pro, so it never got harsh or ashy. It also burned for over an hour and a half -- awesome! We just got hummus to eat, and for $5 it was tasty and a good snack. I will definitely remember Aladdin's even after I leave Nashville."}
{"input": "Their pizza is pretty good, service is usually cool inside. But today I ordered a delivery for the first time, the driver was very insulting to me. When I open my door she asked me about a car across the street with a guy in the driver's seat. I replied \"I don't know,\" she said \"cus I don't wanna be set up to get robbed\". Mind you I already paid with my visa when I ordered, her behavior made me feel awkward as if I had done something wrong. I gave her the tip I had in my hand and said thank you, hoping that maybe if I remain polite she'll stop thinking so negative I just wanted some pizza not to be judged because of my surroundings or to be stereotyped."}
{"input": "I think this is better than the Philadelphia location. Nevertheless, Szechuan house in Hamilton, NJ is still the best."}
{"input": "We sat at a pretty hectic lunch at Johnny rockets in the casino. Our server was Lyndel! She was awesome! Helped us at every needy request lol... Good was good, too! I'm too full"}
{"input": "It may be in the back of a best western but it has carefully selected beer, games and BBQ that was 1000 times our expectation. Awesome!"}
{"input": "This is a great breakfast sandwich spot. Affordable prices and tasty bagels, my favorite is garlic. I wasn't blown away with the lunch options but I would recommend this place for breakfast to my friends and family. Their quality is WAY better than Dunkin Donuts sandwiches. However, the man and woman behind the counter are very rude and it's a shame becuase the owner seems like such a nice man. They have ignored customers standing in a long line to hold conversations and move extremely slow as if no one has anywhere to go. Don't bother calling an order ahead becuase chances are they won't answer the phone during breakfast hours."}
{"input": "Well my daughter and I figured we'd try the new place on Speedway before the one opens up on our side of town on Valencia.   Let me say the burgers looked like Whataburger but that is where it ends.  I get the name now Lotaburger, must come from the Bible as to Lot's wife because the burgers we had tasted like a pillar of salt.  Sorry won't be going to this place again."}
{"input": "One of my favorite restaurants in the Fairmont area.\n\nZorba's is a BYOB with traditional Greek dishes. The prices are reasonable as well. They have an appetizer sampler which is really good and filling in of itself. As a fan of lamb, I've tried several of the stewed dishes and never been let down.\n\nIt's a quaint restaurant you should definitely try out."}
{"input": "Stopped in on a Monday around 7pm and the place was pretty full.  The bartender was friendly and attentive.  The bar seemed well stocked, not a drinker so take that as you will.  Now the food...THE FOOD was fantastic!  I ordered the Pear Gorgonzola Melt.  How they fit all that amazingness on one plate is impressive.  The clientele is all ages and backgrounds, which is great.\n\nNutshell:  Definitely check this place out for a good sandwich at a good price (~$10) and to catch up on the footy games."}
{"input": "Good hoagies, which I have never been disapointed with.  It is always busy when I try them and they are very efficient in how the operation works and keep the wait short.  I have tried other locations as well and for a franchise, the standards are met across the board."}
{"input": "Love the sweet spiral plain pies at Franzones.  Can't go wrong with plain.  I tried the white pizza with onions in addition and it was a pleasant surprise.  The onions were a great addition to the pizza.  Same Franzone's as the Bridgeport one I grew up with."}
{"input": "Now this is a cocktail bar! If hollywood wanted to recreate an old time alchemists cocktail lounge this is it! Bowls of fresh herbs, tons of little tincture bottles of house made bitters (pecan anyone) and who knows what else. Drinks crafted with care, eyedroppers, tweezers, muddlers and strainers...cocktail geek nirvana! \n\nOrder anything off of the menu and it will be a treat for the palette. Or you can chat with the bartenders about your likes and dislikes and have them create something unique...AWESOME.\n\nThe room is very cool and welcoming. Service is attentive even when they are crafting drink after drink on a busy night. \n\nOf course, you can enjoy a beer or ordinary libation of your choice, but I'd suggest trying something new and see what the art of cocktail making can provide."}
{"input": "Wow, what an incredible place!! The food is fabulous and the staff friendly. Friday night there are extended hours with a bistro menu and drink specials. Seating is inside or outside and there is a wonderful bakery next door so you can get fresh baked goods to bring home after! I will be going back!!!"}
{"input": "was I here?  i think so, but the signage didnt say petes.  it just let me know there was a car wash.  there was an automatic credit card reader and you can choose any wash from $3-12 depending on what fixins you like.  \n\nit washed but didnt dry on the $3 wash.\n\nfree vacuums.  \n\nslippery when pulling out onto busy germantown pike so be careful!"}
{"input": "Cute Japanese restaurant in Old City. Fresh sushi and amazing ramen. Wonderful customer service! This is my new favorite go to for sushi and ramen. There is a great selection on the menu."}
{"input": "Caring, personal and fantastic service. My special order tires were miss delivered twice and not only they were extremely vigilant but they actually took me to work and back until they had my tires to replace. Best service I've ever received. Highly recommended! Milton, mike, and Steve are who you want!"}
{"input": "So it's 6:30 pm and all flights at the airport are delayed due to weather. This pizza place is right in the middle of the terminal so it's a good place to grab a bite. Here's the problem. They have no food! I ordered a salad and was told \"we are all out of salads\", then I ordered a slice of margarita pizza and was told that all that is available is pepperoni or cheese. The lady behind me wanted garlic knots, they were out. The place was empty at first so it's not like they sold out. They just didn't stock well. They have one kid working there and he makes one pizza at a time. Don't have a menu up if only 2 of the 11 items are offered! The pizza was fine but it was really a strange experience."}
{"input": "This was my second visit to a chik fil a. My first visit in Bakersfield was a huge disappointment given the build up some of my friends gave me. This Reno location couldn't have been more different. The place was packed so I opted for the drive thru, there were 4 employees, well dressed, clean with superior manners and excellent customer service . They were polite, helpful and fast. They got my order right and the sandwiches were far better than my first visit in Bakersfield. This place is about as squared away as it gets. Way to far exceed my expectations, Well done !"}
{"input": "I recommend getting the migas. We had to wait about 20 min to get a table but we had 5 people in our group. If you're looking for a lively place for brunch, check this place out :)"}
{"input": "We stopped here's on the recommendation of our shuttle driver.  The red velvet ice cream is wonderful!! Pieces of cake. Creamy goodness.  Yum!"}
{"input": "Eight of us came here for brunch for my birthday. We made a reservation and were seated quickly. We did the all-inclusive bottomless drinks which came with the order of any entree. The Bloody Mary's were excellent but the mimosas were more OJ than champagne. I had the steak and eggs which were amazing! The rest of the table enjoyed their food as well. \n\nOur server, Cesar, was excellent. 5 stars for him but 4 stars for the overall experience. We will be back for lunch or dinner another time to try it out!"}
{"input": "Wonderful customer service with attention to detail. Michael Brandon, the Used car Manager is involved in every facet of purchases. They are warm and friendly to work with. \n\n... it's a great company that offers a superior product. But it is Michael who makes it happen. His easy-going manner... here, consultant really means something other than salesperson. There's no push, no hard sell. Just answers to questions and advice on which Cadillac fits you. Michael is the guy I call when I want to buy a car. Nuf' said."}
{"input": "Ready for some unique meat burgers?\n\nFrom Bison to Elk, Bareburger has you covered. Not to be left out, they also boast a nice selection for vegetarians.\n\nWhile here on a visit, I had the El Matador.  A Bison burger with Queso Fresco, pickled jalapenos, guacomole. green leaf, and pico de gallo on a brioche bun. \n\nCan you say mouth party?!  Between the juiciness of the bison burger and the snap of the jalapenos & pico de gallo; I was delighted. \n\nIn addition to my burger I noshed on the spicy pickles and fries with an assortment of dips. \n\nIf I ever find myself in the area again, I will not hesitate to make stop."}
{"input": "Today was my first time ever at federal donuts I must say as soon as I walked in the lady at the front greeted me right away she was so nice and I told her it was my first time and she was so excited that I was there she asked was I here for chicken or donuts I told her donuts she explained what kind she had and told me everything I needed to know let me tell you me and my family loved them I will be returning soon !!!! Thank u guys for making my experience great"}
{"input": "Average American food with deluded aspirations.\n\nYeah, I didn't hate it but I really do not care for eating at a restaurant and thinking, \"Yeah, I can do this better at home.\" (With a blindfold and 1 hand tied behind my back. Ok, maybe not but still)\n\nI had the \"chicken\" enchiladas. Didn't hate them or love them and they come covered in sour cream which is not stated on the menu. So I ended up scraping off more than half the sauce while trying to get rid of the weird white stuff on my food. The beans were good but I have a feeling most people would say they were under seasoned and under salted. The rice was not good. It was dry and boring.\n\nThe bf had the buffalo burger. I didn't try it, as I do not eat buffalo. He said it was seasoned \"different\". \n\nThe service was fine. Not stellar but not horrid.\n\nThe beer was fantastic, lol, which made the dinner better.\n\nI would only eat here again if someone else wanted to."}
{"input": "Wonderful quaint bar with cool clients and an incredibly charming staff. Chefon made me feel so at home. She's beautiful and very funny! She recommended the poutine, mmm. I wish I could stay in New Orleans forever."}
{"input": "Wow!  Yummy, different,  delicious.   Our favorite is the lamb curry and korma.  With 10 different kinds of naan!!!  Don't let the outside deter you (because we almost changed our minds)...go in and try something new!   You'll be glad you did!"}
{"input": "Very pricey for a small amount. The acai was a little watery and I did not enjoy whole hard chocolate chips in the acai bowl."}
{"input": "Cute, lovely place in a hidden location! The service was great and the owners were lovely. Had the chicken and waffles and it was AMAZING!! 10/10 would eat here when I'm in town again!"}
{"input": "If you're looking for a great place to start your day I'd go here. Great place for a simple breakfast that'll fuel you up for a day full of festivities. Portions are huge, prices are great, and the place is cute and quaint. What more can you ask for a breakfast spot?"}
{"input": "I think I would've given this place a 4/5 star rating if not for the lackluster service and attitude. The entrees were good, the prices were spot on, and the breadsticks were delicious.\n\nAhh, the breadsticks. This is where the attitude part kicks in. These things are advertised as \"as much as you want for free.\" However, my buddy heads up to the front counter to request enough for our table of three only to be given a hard time from the manager that we're eating more breadsticks than what we ordered. Give me a break. Don't advertise what you don't want to deliver.\n\nEven ordering was a chore. It seemed as if they had a new hire manning the register during the lunch hour rush. She was placing orders as to-go for people looking to dine-in and had to have the manager place orders for her. Not a good idea for a Friday lunch rush.\n\nIf this Fazoli's location can improve upon these things minor inconveniences, it'd be a great place to grab a quick bite."}
{"input": "My favorite burger in town! The place is confortabke and has a great variety of drinks with bourbon. They should have a reservation policy."}
{"input": "Food was terrible!!! I ordered through Postmates and my order was WRONG. The food was so bland and such a let down. I will NEVER set foot in this place again. I asked for aioli on the side of my to go wings. NOPE. Swimming in aioli. I asked for the wings crispy. NOPE. Skin fell off immediately so soft. I asked for extra peanuts for my vermicelli,. NOPE! Got ZERO peanuts. Asked for sauce. Wish I hadn't. The sauce for he vermicelli was TERRIBLE. Omg never never never ever again. Funny thing is, when I got my receipt, all of the modifications were there. I was expecting to pay extra but I didn't Bc they didn't do any of them."}
{"input": "I've ordered pizza here twice because I am in the neighborhood. Both times have been awful. Today, the dough on my pizza was literally raw. I really want this place to suceed, but the pizza is not good."}
{"input": "Mead -- I always thought of it as some old timey drink.  Boy, did New Day blow my mind with all that they have to offer!\n\nHoney wines, mead, ciders, and even mixed cocktail concoctions.  \n\nI highly recommend starting with a tasting menu so that you can try several different drinks and then settle in a pint of your favorite.  This place looks small, but if you see that door near the back -- head down the hallway to another seating area that is basically the same size as out front.\n\nI also enjoy that New Day supports many local charities and events.  And they sell local honey and other artisan goods.  A great stop when hopping around Fountain Square!"}
{"input": "Very good sushi. The peanut avocado roll is a must try. Delicious! I ordered the Volcano roll as well and it was amazing. The service was also great, very friendly customer service. I will definitely visit again even though it's far from where I live. If you find yourself near Valrico, then definitely visit this restaurant. You will not regret it."}
{"input": "I never knew what Indian was until I ate here. The food is crazy delicious! Since eating at Palace of Asia I've tried other Indian restaurants. Palace is by far the best. The atmosphere is classy, quiet and enjoyable even on a Friday or Saturday night. The service is fabulous. I asked for my food to be very mild and that is no problem for them. I think their favorite thing to say is, \"no problem.\" If you've never eaten Indian food order the Chicken Tikka Masala... trust me. Also, best rice ever. Also, try their mango drink. This is my restaurant of choice."}
{"input": "I was looking for a gluten-free option, which basically left me with a taco salad. It was basic and not very filling, but good. I'd like to try the green smoothie- it looks delicious. I applaud this place for it's location and well designed menu. I hope that they can one day expand their venue to include seating and more gluten-free options."}
{"input": "Great for lunch! Our meals were hearty, tasty, and affordable (most entrees priced around $10).\n\nI had the Hummus Plate which came with 4 falafels, pita bread, and greek salad. But the real star was the Greek Chicken Soup that my husband ordered. The broth reminded me of a creamy Thai soup because it's infused with lemon flavor. Half the customers in the restaurant ordered this and I would definitely go back for seconds!\n\nCan't wait to try dinner at Kanella, especially since Kelly W. says the fish is out of this world."}
{"input": "I loved the ambiance the service is just phenomenal! We received so much food I actually have grocery leaving lol. The food taste just like LOVE! You can just tell the food is cooked from the heart and soul! Glad we decided to try this soul food restaurant reminds me of being in the south!"}
{"input": "I foresee this bar becoming a new local fav, great spot for amazing cocktails and you must try the bar burger, it's the best burger in town! Brunch is also delicious. I would recommend to anyone, whether you're a local or just passing through!"}
{"input": "Lucy's was great! Mimosa's were fresh and the pulled pork was awesome! Great service and food was wonderful. Menu was extensive !"}
{"input": "I'm a guest of the hotel here and I skeptical because typically restaurants inside hotels after that great. Burger Theory broke that trend! I ordered the BT Classic Cheeseburger with a side of fries. The burger was cooked to my request and was delicious!!!! Fries were good and fresh, perfectly seasoned."}
{"input": "Great bagels!  I wish they stayed open later in the day though.  Staff not very friendly but the bagels are worth it!"}
{"input": "I went to Jones because I was craving a good home cooked meal.  I ordered the \"Thanksgiving\" dinner and wished I had saved money and gone to the nearest diner.  The turkey was supposedly baked but it tasted like lunch meat.  The mashed potatoes were instant and the stuffing was not good at all.  Pre-cut carrots served as a bland vegetable.  The best part of the meal was the cranberry sauce which was excellent.  The price was twice that of most diners for a similar meal.   I feel I wasted my money.  Other menu entrees may be very good so if you go there don't order the \"thanksgiving dinner\".  You would be better off buying a TV dinner."}
{"input": "Mike is a fair, straight to the point, no-nonsense businessman. He advised me on what to purchase (and not necessarily from him, although I ended up buying from him in the end) and patiently answered a lot of my bike related questions. I've been a customer for 5 months now, had several repairs and some very good advice when I call. I've had nothing but a positive experience there, and plan to return."}
{"input": "Traditional Mexican Cuisine that is made in front of you're eyes\n\nBest place to grab a burrito in South Jersey. Very friendly staff who will make you feel at home. \n\nIn my opinion, Pancheros over Chipotle any day of the week!\n\nIf you feel like your not getting a fair portion for your money, just ask for a little extra. Doesn't hurt to ask!"}
{"input": "The food is okay! The rice under the sushi seems hard sometimes. The hot pots are pretty good though. The Shabu shabu is what I come for! Overall its good, but not great!"}
{"input": "Great shop! Lots of options. Very helpful service -- David will help you pick out everything. Framed 5 items. Reasonable prices too!"}
{"input": "Excited to have this place in Reno! Delicious matcha and ube flavors! Like authentic. Friendly staff, looking to get better but what they have as a base is solid. Soft serve, cake and the sauces aren't overly sweet.  Hoping they add more flavors!"}
{"input": "I've been to this location many times when I lived in the area and although it is a chain and not exactly sexy, it does the job on many occasions.   If you need an oil change, this place is ok, if you need a state inspection this place does it.   The key is getting there when they are not busy or else you will wait.   \n\nAgain, nothing fancy here a pep boys is a pep boys but all in all decent stuff."}
{"input": "Stopped by for lunch with a group, so didn't get to experience the belly-dancers.  Most in the group ordered the gyros - wihch were decent.  Service was a little slow - possibly because of the large group size.\n\nGood ambience, average to better food, slower service."}
{"input": "This hospital is by far the best for families on the East Coast. They make seeing multiple MDs on the same day very easy and the quality of care is incredible. The renovated wing is fantastic with good accommodations for caregivers and friendly and attentive staff. I wholeheartedly recommend A.I. DuPont and will continue to travel from NY for my child's care."}
{"input": "In a week of beer and wine tasting in Southern California this place had the standout beer!  Their XII quad was to die for.  I'm usually an IPA man where my wife usually goes for porters and stouts and this one hit the spot with both of us.  \n\nNice bar area and friendly staff close to other wine and beer tasting rooms in the Funk Zone - definitely worth going the extra couple of blocks for it."}
{"input": "Love love live Orangetheory!! Best full body workout ever!!! And so many classes.... always convenient!"}
{"input": "L9 and a pepsi! This restaurant has the BOMB thai. With it being so close to Macdill AFB it can get really busy at times, but once inside you will know why it stays so busy. The food is flavorful and spicy and the lunch menu is reasonably priced so you dont go broke eating there. The waitresses seem to be related to one another and it seems to be family run. If you like really spicy food go for the Thai Spicy, other than that stick with the mild or medium spicy and you will be happy! Restaurant is always VERY clean and very quick with their service, I highly recommend if you need some good thai food in your life!"}
{"input": "Legitimately 50% cheaper than stores on Canal Street. (Bought Sazerac Rye, Herbsaint and a large bottle of Peychaud's for ~$56, versus the ~$97 it would have cost at the Roosevelt Hotel's gift shop)\n\nAlso, insanely vast selection, including (but not limited too) two kinds of orange bitters and celery bitters. I was pretty sure you could only find those things online or in specialty shops in New York City. \n\nNow you know."}
{"input": "Great place, decent price for rentals. Dudes are always super respectful and amiable and not condescending like some other ranges can be. Military discount. Phil is the man! thanks guys"}
{"input": "A local told us about this nice coffee house on our first day in NOLA. It's nice and clean, the guy behind the counter was nice and the iced mocha latte was great. If your looking for great, inexpensive coffee this is the place."}
{"input": "Stopped in for dinner, and we had a fantastic experience. The service was pleasant, the food delicious plus the atmosphere was very welcoming. Mike the owner, said hello to us and just made us feel very at home. We will be back!"}
{"input": "A GREAT used book shop.... very few duds.\n\nI  CAN NOT comprehend these lazy, \"elite\" Yelpers who give this place three stars and complain that they have to look for books in actual space.\n\nIt's not Google or Amazon, it's reality.  Living in it, drifting through their jammed stacks is bliss, finding something you weren't looking for is bliss cubed.\n\nHuzzah for Book Trader!"}
{"input": "Friendly people,  quick service.  Place ok,  Food (spaghetti) was underwhelming,  not worth the price... Located in a new area that has a nice future."}
{"input": "Delicious, tasty, very competitive (formula with 2 starters+1 entree for 15$. Adorable service, the best coconut icecream i had ever. Do not hesitate."}
{"input": "Chery did a magnificent  job creating a desert bar that was beautiful and filled with delicious cakes, cup cakes, tarts and brownies. Our guest all made comments about how excellent the deserts were. She was so sweet and helpful in guiding me in selections to offer. The presentation was beautiful."}
{"input": "Fast.  Fresh.  The carne was very good.  So was the guacamole.  Wish there was the ability to customize taco toppings.  The tortilla chips were too thick.  The dulche de leche  soft serve ice cream was amazingly delicious.  Wish that there was more seating.  Wish that table clean ups were more timely and more thorough."}
{"input": "Good times and great crowds at Grand Opening over Memorial Day weekend.  Another good addition to the local craft beer scene.  Current beer selections include a wheat, stout, IPA, and seasonal IPA.  And the beers are slightly stronger, ranging from 6.0 to 7.3% ABV.\n\nThe ambiance of the taproom is very nice, with wooden interior and large garage doors to give it an airy feel.  There is also a good view on the inside of the fermenters in which the beers are brewed.  One other note on the taproom are the artwork.  The artwork are some of the same as the ones shown on First Fridays.  Think the aim is to use the space to display works from local artists.\n\nI only tried the stout during my visit during Grand Opening, and it had a good flavor w/ coffee undertones.  Hope to make it back to try out the other brews, as well as finding out about new styles that might be coming out."}
{"input": "This has fast become one of my favorite New Orleans gems! Enter over at the bridge on Peters near Elysian Fields or a little way up on Piety, either way, if you like breezes and city views, your efforts will be rewarded. The path stretches about a 1.25 miles from close to Elysian Fields over to the area near the old Navy installation. Along the way are various art installations, a dog park, and a wonderful walk along the mighty Mississippi River. If you time it just right, you might catch one of the spectacular sunsets. A beautiful way to end any day in NOLA!"}
{"input": "A couple friends and I stopped by for some late night milkshakes and found ourselves at More Than Just Ice Cream. Well, we just got ice cream...not fully taking advantage of what the name implies, but maybe next time.\n\n3 milkshakes: 1 coffee, 1 chocolate, and 1 black&white malt. \n\nAll were pretty good. Definitely satisfied the ice cream craving. I thought my coffee milkshake could have been thicker, same goes for the chocolate. The black&white was plenty thick and was probably the best of the three. Unfortunately, I did not order that one so I settled for my not so creamy coffee.\n\nI did sample some ice cream flavors before setting on a milkshake. I tried the pumpkin pie which was AMAZING. I don't know why I didn't just get this. Maybe a milkshake isn't the way to go here."}
{"input": "The bayou burger is literally the best burger I've ever had. Great staff also -definitely a big thumbs up."}
{"input": "Arrived late in town and this was the perfect spot for a reasonably priced, quick meal. My husband had a double burger with a grilled cheese in the middle! I had a zydeco dog, both we good. It was quite loud, but the NCAA games were on. Definitely worth a stop in if you are looking for a good, decent priced burger."}
{"input": "This was the second time coming here.  First time we came the wait for a drink (only got a drink) was quite long.  The second time coming was for dinner.  I personally ordered a Johnny Blaze...this was good; however, the burger was half the size of the bun...So I feel like I just got one slider and a handful of fries.  The other order was a Ruuurouper (grouper tacos) which was sooooo rubbery tasting I actually spit it out.   It seemed as though I was gnawing on my tire.  It's unfortunate as the ambiance is pretty decent and wait staff was attentive."}
{"input": "Very very busy when I was there...stopped in for one and left good bartender once I got his attention .... only one bartender on a Sunday in 30th Street Station ???? REALLY????? I'm not slamming the bartender just who ever scheduled one bartender on a Sunday (or the bartender that called out sick)"}
{"input": "Had an overall great experience at The Saint Hotel during a three night stay.  The hotel is conveniently located on Canal Street and just a short walk away from the French Quarter and the Central Business District.\n\nDidn't have any complaints about the noise level even though our room faced Canal Street.  The higher the floor the better I imagine if you're particularly sensitive to noise.\n\nThe rooms were comfortable, clean and newly renovated.  I didn't have a chance to check out the bar and restaurant as there was a filming happening in the lobby and well, there's so many places to go out in New Orleans, but they looked very cool.\n\nThe free wifi was awesome and exactly how it should be - free.\n\nOnly ding was that there was no hand soap in our room upon arrival and the coffee pods were not refilled each day.\n\nI would recommend a stay here."}
{"input": "This place is awesome! The food is really good. I'm a huge fan of the white chicken chili, the buttered bread, and the fudge. The costumer service is always fabulous and if it isn't let the owners know! They will really make it up to you!"}
{"input": "Nice new burger spot downtown! They are apart of the harry & izzys chain. The burgers are pretty good. You do have to order a side separately which kinda sticks but seems to be a trend these days. They take reservations so that's always a plus. If you are looking for additional options besides a burger might not be your best spot to go. I'd like to see them do a lunch special during the week for those that go during the work day. I think it would help with costs and getting a bigger lunch crowd. Overall great experience and service. Check them out!"}
{"input": "After a last minute cancellation of dog walking services for our vacation, we luckily found Zen Pet Care Services!\n\nChris and Elisha were extremely responsive and accommodating.  They were able to come out to meet our dogs within just a few days and we could not have been more thankful!\n\nWe'll definitely be contacting them for our future needs!"}
{"input": "Spent my birthday here and it was heaven. The entire day I received services and all were amazing.  The shower in the body treatment room is spectacular!"}
{"input": "This is my neighborhood cafe, and it's everything I want: casual dining, friendly service, dog-friendly outdoor patio, and good food. In some ways, Ghini's reminds me of the Hotel Congress' Cup Cafe, but quieter and more laid-back. I've been here for breakfast, lunch, and desserts. Ghini's is a popular place with a solid reputation---and the bakery next door is a favorite too. I'm awarding the cafe four stars instead of five because the place does get a little chaotic during the peak times (again, just like the Cup) and I can see how a first-time visitor might find that off-putting. All in all, I recommend you try Ghini's and discover one of Tucson's delights. Enjoy!"}
{"input": "I live in the neighborhood and used to order at least once a week and pick up.  The last last few times I have had to wait from 10 to 15 minutes as the team scrambles around trying to find change. All I wanted to do is pay for my food and take it home.   And tonight after the wait for change. I gave them 2 20's for a 27 dollar check. \nI get home and it is the wrong food. My warm dish was cold and my sushi was wrong.  Lost me as a customer"}
{"input": "What is wrong with this O Charley's?  Where  to begin.  The positive, our waitress Kaitlyn was outstanding.  That's it for the positive.  It is a Sunday...Fathers Day and only place in town with no brunch wait.  Our first signal.  They didn't have enough menus when we were seated.  It took 25 minutes for one of drinks to arrive.  My wife's coffee was cold and full of grounds.  Food arrived.  My omelet was cooked to death, never got my toast or fruit.  Everyone else got waffles.  They were chewy like they had been re heated.  Only two small things of syrup.  No butter or sugar on my wife's. Her eggs were scrambled rather than over hard.  Just one thing after another.  Never be back for brunch."}
{"input": "Our go to place for cheap cheerful and awesome. Love the staff, brisk and efficient but will crack an occasional smile. Everything's good but try the special turkey club."}
{"input": "We got takeout from here last night for dinner and I was really impressed! I've had Thai from a lot of the places around Brandon and typically I wind up disappointed.....most places aren't authentic and just really lack. This was not the case for Jasmine Thai. The main reason I took the star is because their crab rangoons were a bit dry. But my husband had the Chicken Basil and I had the Chicken Panang Curry and they were both wonderful. Also I must comment on the decor inside, they could use new carpeting but other than that it was one of the nicest Thai restaurants I've seen."}
{"input": "Service has been great both times I've been there. I now crave the ABC burger. Delicious. Save room for a boozy shake. Yum!"}
{"input": "So surprised by all these lower reviews. Every time I've been here the food has been DELICIOUS, we really have enjoyed everything we've ever had, from a simple cheeseburger to an omelet to the bigger dinner entrees. The desserts are delicious. Portions are big. Staff is always friendly and attentive and have never made a mistake. It is not the cheapest place but I do feel you get what you pay for and the ambiance is warm and nice. Good for bigger groups too."}
{"input": "Conveniently located across the street from Bryn Mawr Hospital between Glenbrook Avenue and County Line Road, I shopped here for the first time last week and was pleasantly surprised. For $4 I picked up a pair of cropped pants that I was unable to find in any retail stores.  I also saw some lovely Wedgwood dishes for only $10 each that I would have grabbed as well if I hadn't been on a budget.  The staff was friendly, too.  The dressing room was an open, community-style room; there were no private stalls.  A little too personal for me!  Also, the store is not handicap-accessible, as shopping on the upper floor requires climbing stairs.  The public dressing room and handicapped-unfriendly store layout are the reasons for the star deduction."}
{"input": "We were only staying for the night.  The concierge upgraded our room when he realized we were first time visitors.  They went out of their way to make our visit memorable.  Would stay there again if I am ever in Nashville."}
{"input": "Nashville is challenged when it comes to Italian food in my opinion. This restaurant is no exception. Disclaimer: I lived near several great Italian places in NYC so I am spoiled. That said, la Tavola is still below what I feel should be an average experience. \n\nIf you have high standards for Italian food, you will likely be disappointed. The recipes aren't traditional (the Marsala so many people rave about is a creamy sauce, for example, rather than a nice, light Marsala wine based sauce). If you are looking for something a little better than Pizza Hut, you will be happy."}
{"input": "Good quality food for decent prices. Fast and fresh, this is a great place and one of the best in town in its category. I make burger joint a regular stop!"}
{"input": "My husband just got his hair cut at this new salon with his favorite hair stylist, Susy Hurtado.  Susy has done such an awesome job with my husband's hair that he's stayed with her for over three years and followed her to salon renova. He also loves their conversations.  (Should I be jealous?  JK). \n\nPer my husband, \"The salon has a great atmosphere, a great location.  Easy parking.\"  Also, he loves the sinks because they tilt and are so comfortable."}
{"input": "We tried to stop in and wait for a table for the second night in a row. The hostess was utterly useless. She refused to tell us how many tables were in front of us, rough estimate of how long it would be (other than a while), and wouldn't tell us how long a to go order would be. There were empty tables everywhere so I didn't understand why there was such a long wait. \n\nSince we did eat there the night before and we were trying to go back, the food was good. Best cheesecake my fiancé ever had. My steak was cooked well and flavorful. My baked potato was cold when it came out. Bread was yummy. But the service sucks so bad, I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"input": "I really do not understand the bad reviews at all. This is the best burger in Hendersonville. They are delicious! The buns are so tasty and the burgers super juicy. Great value for such high quality. French fries and sweet potato fries are a must. My husband and I have tried several of their burgers and none have disappointed. I'd give it 5 stars but the atmosphere is a bit .. Boring. Otherwise great food and good service."}
{"input": "Horrible disgusting not sure how they are even open. Food tasted old and was served cold and had zero taste."}
{"input": "Ate at Desire two times, once 2 years ago and 2 weeks ago. Both experiences were picture perfect. The service is impecable and the food followed in suit. Dont let the fact that its dead smack on Bourbon Street put you off.......Desire is a Jewel....Guaranteed. \n\nNote: Remember that if youre trying to keep dinner on a budget at Desire, dont order any alchohol......itll run up the tab in a hurry :)"}
{"input": "Incredibly impressed - I'm relatively new to the Philadelphia area and took my parents here to show them what the city has to offer, and we were all blown away.  Delicious food, affordable prices, great ambience, and very kind staff - we even got a Cyprus travel brochure from the restaurant owner after asking about how the food was made.  I might take him up on the offer at some point!"}
{"input": "chicken sandwich was a little light on the jam and spinach, good portion of chicken.  Roll was great.  But really, .50 for a little side of mayo when 7 of us are ordering sandwiches and drinks?"}
{"input": "LOVE THIS PLACE!! Visited on a flash trip to NOLA and loved the donuts. Cant wait to be backkk"}
{"input": "It's a combination of Urban Outfitters meets Anthropologie, with a whole lot of Pottery Barn.  I'm a big fan!"}
{"input": "I am surprised this place doesn't have better reviews.  I have found the people to be very nice.  The meat/seafood department is excellent.  I live in nearby Mt. Airy and come here a lot to get meat to grill.  We also frequently take advantage of the meal of the week which typically has an entrée, side, and desert for a very good price.  They will have all the elements together and there is a recipe card you can pick up.  The bakery is also very good.\n\nI agree with the commenters that the produce selection is pretty bad.  This does not bother me, however, because we have a ton of good options for produce in the area.  We have 2 weavers ways, A&N produce in Germantown, and Produce Junction in Glenside.  For everything but produce I find myself coming to the fresh market a lot.  I find the parking lot to be very convenient.  With the layout of the store I can zip in and out very quickly.  I have also never had to wait in a long line which I appreciate."}
{"input": "I love love love this place!  I make a point of it to come here every single time I'm in Santa Barbara.  Every time!\n\nI never order smoothies anywhere else as I have a badass blender at home and can make just about any type of smoothie I can dream up (and I do).  But I will go out of my way to pick one up from this place.  I don't know what it is but BB has cast some sort of spell on me.  \n\nUgh, now I'm craving one..."}
{"input": "Great bar that has above average pub food. Friendly staff. Fair pricing. Lots more tv's added! I always stop in when I come into town!"}
{"input": "Everyone here is so nice. They had 3 employees working and they all greeted each customer. They explained their different cupcakes but I kept it simple with a red velvet and and wedding cake. The cupcakes were great. I can't wait to go back and try some different one. \n\nGreat experience. A MUST GO!"}
{"input": "Excellent venue for a quick lunch! NY style pizza accompanied by a delicious fresh salad.  They offer Daily weekday specials.  The best part is sitting out on the shady patio."}
{"input": "The food here is great. They're quick and the staff is so nice, seriously. I always feel welcome when I place my order here."}
{"input": "Nice little bar located at the very far end of Terminal E and Tampa International. The airport recently added several new restaurants with a \"local vibe\" and this is one of them. There isn't a ton of seating but it also isn't close to the TSA area so it's a bit hidden. Hey have TVs if you wanna catch a game while you wait for your flight. Food is very reasonably price for the portion size. Appetizers run from $5-$10 and majority of sandwiches are $12. I didn't order any food but it looked amazing! Drinks are tasty and Prices are not terrible. Think 22oz Jai Alai for $8.50. You cannot take alcoholic beverages into the terminal (Columbia does this I think). I had a Manhattan for $11 and it was very tasty. Staff is attentive and friendly. I know my new spot when I'm waiting on a Delta flight!"}
{"input": "1st time here. We were headed to Terakawa with the family on a cold Friday night, but they had a line out the door so we went here. Glad we did...\n\nExcellent service & friendly staff. Waitress helped my wife take off her jacket as her hands were full with our baby, as I was tied up with the 3yr old.\n\nI had Chicken Katsu Curry Ramen, Sister had Shrimp Katsu Ramen & Wife had Shoyu Ramen. Everything was excellent, I loved mine. Curry soup was tasty &I the fried chicken was done just right. Same for my sisters shrimp, fried just right with good quality shrimp. My wife lived her Shoyu Ramen.\n\nWe also got the pork buns which were excellent, but not your traditional porkbun. \n\nGreat, great experience."}
{"input": "I was told by many people to try this place out and it did not disappoint. We went very early in the morning so we were in and out quickly. I am told it can sometimes be a wait to try the delicious goodies here. Our group all tried multiple items. The shrimp and grits were very good, this came with fried shrimp for any one wanting to know as it is not listed on the menu as being fried. Still a very good selection for breakfast. The biscuits were very  moist and fluffy. The coffee selection here is very good and high quality much strong than what we make at home. Will defiantly be recommending this place to friends and family."}
{"input": "This is a fantastic environment to work in.  Everyone who works there is friendly and considerate of others.  The conference rooms are great for small meetings, and Collin was really helpful when we needed assistance.  There are numerous places to grab lunch nearby.  If I lived in Reno, I would be here on a regular basis."}
{"input": "Great little find! Came here for brunch & built my own Bloody Mary.I also had their roast beef signature sandwich.  Good service too!  I will def come back for more"}
{"input": "Really chill atmosphere. Had the special sandwich for lunch which was delicious. Fiancé had a couple of good beers. Bartender was super friendly."}
{"input": "After not dying my hair since 2015, I knew it was time to switch it up & try something new before summer. They did such a great job & I received a lot of compliments! Will be returning"}
{"input": "Hands-down my favorite restaurant in New Orleans. Fantastic happy hour with $.50 oysters and half-price drinks from 4-6. Amazing gumbo, tuna, and even the burger is phenom. Wow."}
{"input": "This is our favorite Italian restaurant by far. The service is always good and the food is always delicious. My husband and I have tried several different plates and they have all been very good. The building doesn't look like much from the outside, but it's pretty nice on the inside. Their cheesecake is pretty amazing too!"}
{"input": "Wonderful wonderful food and service! We had an outstanding lunch amid bonus that it was directly across the street from our hotel.  1 star off for service on the next day - I called that morning to order a to go to take with me for my long flight home.  I specified pick up time. When I got there they said the person who took the order forgot about it.  It wasn't ready and I couldn't wait as I had to leave for the airport. Disappointed when I had to have airport food instead."}
{"input": "Comfortable bed, good breakfast, fast internet, great location, and low price. Overall I was really impressed with this place. However, if you stay on the top floors you may be waiting up to 15 minutes for an elevator in the morning."}
{"input": "Food here is good, woman who answered phone was extremely rude to me...very unprofessional"}
{"input": "This place is fantastic. The food is exceptional and the service couldn't be better. Very nice and generous people with a cool atmosphere. I eat here almost every weekend. Can't beat the Cuban espresso!"}
{"input": "Awesome place on Broadway in Nashville.  Music was better than most great entertainment.  Had deep fried chicken was tasty once you get past the breading.  Only first floor was open with a 15 minute waiting time."}
{"input": "Hands down, one of the BEST steak places around! The atmosphere- an \"adult\" restaurant, with \"adult\" servers! No screaming, crying children. Light music, great service, great food. Very relaxing dinner! Have never had a bad meal and drinks are great too!!!"}
{"input": "Peter saved us the serious tragedy of missing another day of work and the misfortune of being taken by the dealership. We can't thank him enough for getting us in right away and getting us back on road."}
{"input": "Such a fun party bus!  Fransisco did a wonderful job driving us around Santa Ynez for our friends 40th birthday.  We toured around different wineries, drank way too much and he got us all back to our hotel safety.  Thank you Fransisco and jump on the school bus for a great time!  We'll definitely be using you again."}
{"input": "Who would have known! Food here is delicious. Can't really go wrong. Specials like chicken and waffles are always a nice surprise too. Definitely a unique and fresh menu for a \"department store\". Staff is friendly, can get crowded on weekends but they provide you with a buzzer so you can shop while you wait for your table. Unfortunately, deserts are amazing too! Be hungry."}
{"input": "The hotel room service is terrible cause they skimp on shampoos, conditioners,body lotions,tissue and on the toilet paper .You would think they want to keep the customers happy,well they're very cheap on everything. My sheets and towels are often stained. I booked the hotel for the week, and spending the alot of money on my vacation this will never be the hotel I'll ever stay at.Thats a feed back toward better service for the future customers!"}
{"input": "I love the Warson woods location but this not the same. Service was slooow. The sushi roll was rolled loose and it feel apart. It is trying to be too fancy and is not focused on the sushi basics ... just good sushi in a fun comfortable place. The interior is very lovely. The service was just OK. I might try again since I like the other locations."}
{"input": "We order food for the office from here all the time.  The food is healthy but doesn't taste bad.  They offer a variety of foods from chicken salad salads to peanut butter and jelly in peta bread.  They also offer soups and smoothies.  They deliver right to our office floor."}
{"input": "Stayed here for a conference at the hotel so that was convenient. Location isn't near any of the action per se, but everything Is Within a mile or less so not that big of a deal unless it is torrential rain, which of course it was! My two biggest complaints are the beds are so uncomfortable. Like, crazy, how is it even possible for a bed to be made so poorly? If I slept on the ground I might have had a better nights sleep. Pillows need an upgrade too. My second complaint is the noise. You can hear everything, a door closes, a shower starts, people coming in at midnight, 2 am, 3am, 4 am, oh well, wasn't sleeping anyway the beds are so damn hard. The hotel restaurant was pricey, but really decent for a hotel bar. Overall, I wouldn't recommend staying here, there are too many other fabulous locations, but if you had to stay, it's not too bad and the art is cool."}
{"input": "Great Cranberry Orange Muffin and Caffe Latte on a Saturday morning. Great ambience and fast service."}
{"input": "Not too sure why all the negative reviews. I was in and out within 5 mins. Maybe it was because I wasn't looking for something elaborate, who knows. Anyways, I got exactly what I needed and the employees were courteous. The store was organized, well stocked and clean. Unfortunately for this area however, I don't see them staying in business. So many other places near by closed."}
{"input": "Great bar food, the Cuban is the sh@t.  Awesome Saturday bartender!!  All in all, a great experience."}
{"input": "ONE OF THE BEST FOOD TRUCKS IN PHILADELPHIA!\n\nThis is coming from a person that doesn't like trying to things, extremely picky, and not very daring... EVERYTHING on their menu is so good and filling! My favorites are veggie burger wrap which is $5 (instead of veggie burger, it'll be in a tortilla, but somehow 10x better) and chicken satay tacos (2 for $7). Their thai bubble tea is extremely tasty too! \n\nBeware of the long lines though (try to avoid going anytime from 11:45-12:30, if you do, expect a long wait, and no you cannot call ahead and order). If you're a Drexel student, go in between class, guaranteed no line! \n\nCASH ONLY"}
{"input": "Having grown up in the south I equate fried food with comfort. I live in California where it isn't inextricably woven as in my heart. Zydeco filled me up with great food and did my heart good as well.  The catfish was the most tender and succulent that I've had in memory.  The shrimp and oysters were flash fried to perfection. The okra was crunchy and perfectly salted!  Go?"}
{"input": "Food is on point.  I am deducting 1 star for the condition of the bathrooms on the Friday night I went.. Toilet didn't flush, no toilet paper or paper towels and overall gross."}
{"input": "Went here for dinner today. Here is the review, good and bad. We got salsa and that was homemade and it was delicious! Also, the steak was not too bad, just slightly burnt. It was alright. The fries were very good, the bread was yummy. Overall a good or okay experience. Wish the steak wasn't so burnt, but I'll be back!"}
{"input": "Good food!!! Parking lot!!! Ok service. Limited English staff so it's a point and nod kinda place."}
{"input": "Just what we were looking for.  A neighborhood bar with better than average bar food.  The meatloaf sandwich was delicious!  Sara was a wonderful bartender and gave honest suggestions.  Great find!"}
{"input": "Awesome tacos!  I first walked in and expected it to be like chipotle....I was wrong.  Carne asada tacos had a lot of flavor and the meat was cooked perfectly.  Beer was cold, service was good.  Long line but it moved quickly.  One of the best tacos in town!"}
{"input": "LOVE the building itself and all the fab art on the walls. One of the things that makes Eagle unique. Very fun place to grab coffee with a friend! I pass on the food though, because its really not great."}
{"input": "Nice salon and clean. Holly did my pedicure and it was so relaxing. I chose the pomegranate pedicure and was not disappointed. Long did my powder dipped nails and also did a wonderful job. I will be coming here when I'm in town."}
{"input": "This is a small-size Whole Foods, bigger than South street but tiny compared to Cherry Hill or Marlton, NJ. The staff however is always super nice, best of the 3 others and they are good about special orders. I love farmers markets and small local markets with great produce, but this Whole Foods offers convenience and excellent quality fresh produce. Their new location is being built north and a block closer to Fairmount so even closer for us, yay!"}
{"input": "Too-soft ice cream. Kids working don't pay attention to you and chat with each other. Bad ice cream. I like DQ, but not this one!"}
{"input": "We had awful service (took 2 hours to bring the food when we ordered 5 small plates and 2 items from the middle of the menu - and everything was vegetarian).... Wondering if our waitress was new?  She also messed up the order and brought us plates from the order of the table prior to us.   However, the food was all good!  \nAfter speaking with the manager, the restaurant redeemed itself when they comped a big portion of the meal and threw in 3 desserts.   We would have likely walked away with a very different opinion had we had normal (\"good\") service!   3.5 stars"}
{"input": "I ate here for the first time today.  The woman that works behind the counter is really friendly and offered to waive the minimum credit order amount ($7), since I work nearby.\n\nThe food itself is pretty average for American-Chinese food.  Nothing great, but not bad either.  My sauce was greasy, but the food in general doesn't seem to be (e.g. fried rice).  They do have some vegetarian options which are of the tofu variety as opposed to fake meat. \n\nI would go back since they have lunch specials that come with rice and either a drink, soup, or egg roll ($5.75).\n\nEDIT: I got super sick after leaving this review, and I'm 99% sure it was food poisoning.  Will not be returning."}
{"input": "The food was pretty good with exception to the ham; pictured was a ham steak and I got cooked lunch meat. Also, start to finish, we were there close to 2 hours. Granted, we did come on Memorial Day, but still way too long."}
{"input": "Great neighborhood place. They fry up some good food and their Mac and cheese is super yummy!"}
{"input": "This is my new favorite nail salon! Very clean and fresh. They use disposable liners for pedicure bowls and also provide you with your own set of tools. Beautiful salon with great nail techs. They also offer a variety of services such as waxing and have many types of mani/pedis.  Love it here and will definitely go back."}
{"input": "Ughh. So I have called them with questions a few times and its sooo frustrating! I understand I have to keep getting redirected and being put on hold and etc, but some of the representatives I talk to are so rude! At one point, I was talking and the lady cut me off and said \"hold on\". Put me on hold, comes back, had to repeat myself, and in the middle of me talking, she does it again! I think after that I may have gotten a different representative which meant I definitely had to repeat the same question all over again. Geeeeeze, so frustrating! I already had to repeat the question after being redirected like 3 or 4 other times!"}
{"input": "Marriott could care less about helping you.  Wow.  Love this hotel. Hate the mgmt \nAlso. It's music city USA and u can't hardly hear music in the hotel"}
{"input": "This was the first coffee shop I visited in Philly (trying to branch out from Starbucks) and I wasn't disappointed!\n\nThe atmosphere is my favorite! There is plenty of room and plenty of tables to sip your coffee or pull out books to study (they offer free wifi). The shrubbery at the front of the door adds to the charm and makes you feel like it is a secret spot (haha). As a plus, the bathrooms are also very nice and clean!\n\nThe staff is super great ! Quick to take orders and whip them up.  I saw them walking around cleaning multiple times.\n\nI ordered a pumpkin spice latte with almond milk.  It was very good! It didn't have a strong pumpkin flavor with lots of spice which some people don't like. A little pricey in my opinion around $5 for a small but that's usually how much lattes are anyways elsewhere.  \n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed Good Karma and can't wait to go back, grab a coffee and study!"}
{"input": "I doubt that anyone even reads the reviews before going to this place, it is so popular around town that everyone knows about it and there is no way to go wrong with it, anytime I need any kind of delicious meat, coffee or just want to grab a quick bite this is the place to go."}
{"input": "Had the lunch platters (curry chicken and goat) and the roti here - the platters were decently sized and the curry was flavorful. The Mac and cheese that came with the platter tasted a little stale though, but as a side dish it worked out okay. I would recommend getting the roti instead - it comes out hot, with a substantial filling, and is really satisfying to eat. \n\nWould love to come back to try the juices or pastries - they have a pretty big assortment on the menu!"}
{"input": "I absolutely love Courtney! She is hands down the best hairstylist I have ever had. The reason I think she is so great is that she knows what will look best on me and over the past year has understood my limits for styles. I always go into the salon and tell her to cut my hair how she thinks will look best, and I always leave blown away at what she does. You know you have a great stylist when you don't have to specify what you want done, but instead they see what needs to be done. Great stylist, great personality and very knowledgeable. I would highly recommend her to anyone who wants to look their best."}
{"input": "I may follow up with this review later but for now I just want to say; Revolucion, I love you,"}
{"input": "Not quite up to expectations considering most of the other reviews, was cozy & charming but from the moment we walked in we didn't feel very welcome, they almost seemed put off by the fact that there were seven of us in our group, would think this would be a welcome sight since it was about 9:00 in the morning & only a handful of customers there, waitress seemed to be in a bad mood, unacomadating , & short, food was just  ok, most everything was barely warm & a little on the bland side, ' the sausage gravy was just gravy with sausage chunks on top, biggest issue for me were the biscuits, seems a shame to go threw the  trouble to make homade gravy & specialize in omelets & accompany it all w/ a cheap, frozen biscuit, would rather it not be on the menu at all, they have the potential to be really good, but we're far from it this time"}
{"input": "There is no better Thai food in the Tampa Bay area.  This is authentic Thai food. Not your typical \"not too spicy please\" bland Thai food made for Americans. Although you can decide how spicy or not you want your dish. Fresh delicious food at reasonable prices. The Yum Nua beef salad is one of my favorites, tender slices of grilled beef, cucumbers, scallions, purple onion over greens with a light lime dressing. Other favorites include Panang chicken, beef or shrimp, papaya salad, chicken satay, fried rolls, thai sausage. pork larb. If I ever won the lottery I would hire the cook. She's is the best!"}
{"input": "I received a vase of flowers for Mother's Day and they are terrible. I'm sure my son paid top dollar, because he always does. But this very small bouquet had only three roses that never opened and wilted within two days. The rest of the arrangement was cheap filler flowers. It came in a plain glass vase with dirty water and no bow or ribbon. They forgot the candy that came with it and had to deliver it later in the day. Look elsewhere if you are looking to send an impressive gift, because this one was not."}
{"input": "Rude and impatient while going through the drive thru. It was an inconvenience to ask Monica any kind of question. Won't be back. If you don't like your job work somewhere else."}
{"input": "The best Sicilian pizza around! Delicious shrimp, chicken Caesar salads. We will be back. Great service, almost a little too attentive. We were interrupted quite frequently while trying to eat."}
{"input": "Beautiful waterfront park with lots to do! They have a mini splash park, docks, playground, picnic tables, a bait shop and a small restaurant. If you're in the area definitely check this park out and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"input": "I believe the owner greeted me at the door. She was rude and threatened service if I didn't get gel. The quality received is not worth the price."}
{"input": "Penca is a quaint restaurant in the heart of downtown Tucson. The look and feel of the restaraunt is perfect for a date night or a meeting, it's not too big and not too loud so you can actually hold a conversation with who you're dining with. The drinks and food here are very good. The bartenders take crafting a cocktail seriously and you can see this and taste this in their drinks. The food is fresh and appetizing. Their tacos are simply delicious, the corn tortillas are a perfect thickness and the meats and tacos filling is so fresh and so filling. I love this place and always recommend it whenever anyone is looking for an intimate space to hit downtown."}
{"input": "If you're looking for good waffles...who knew, Waffle House!! Kind of cramped inside, but good comfort food none the less."}
{"input": "We've eaten here twice, both times during off-hours. Food was fine, service friendly and attentive. We'd go back."}
{"input": "I found this place through my partner as he was getting some work done on his car. When I told them about my Honda, they were very excited about it. I didn't even mention (yet) that I needed some work done on it, but they seemed so passionate :)\n\nI just got some brake light bulbs fixed, and some rear brake work in since I asked them to check to see if anything needed replacing. They are super nice, very honest, knowledgeable, have great rates for repairs, and most of all--they never made me feel like I was a car-challenged person. \n\nAlso, there is a cat in the waiting room that's super cute :D\n\nIf you live in NOLA or are in the greater NOLA area, let THIS shop be your go-to! They pretty much do everything!"}

{"input": "I got a bacon and egg sandwich and it was awesome. The impressive thing about this place is that I had a change of plans and had to leave quick and my waitress changed my order to a to go order and had me ready to go in like 30 sec flat. She was really nice about it. I was there for breakfast and there were only breakfast items on the menu but usually diners have some more lunchy options. So if I had to make one suggestion it would be that."}
{"input": "Worst customer service ever, food is par by far, dirty tables, nothing like a real New York slice, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is away from home in need of a slice of pie. I taste the time frame of some of the ingredients, Like they sat to long before being used. How could the great state of NY ever allow people who serve crappy food to use their name."}
{"input": "I asked the woman at the counter which sandwich she preferred and she said, \"The Wendy.\" And then she revealed her nametag and it said Wendy! Okay, well, can't really argue with that. And I'm glad I didn't. That was a really good chicken sandwich. I had mine with grilled chicken and fresh garlic, in addition to the standard issue peppers and veggies. Dang, it was really good! The bread was soft, warm, and it soaked up the Italian seasoning with perfect absorbancy without going soggy. I cannot complain.\n\nMy wife had a chicken caesar wrap which was also excellent. The dressing was creamy without being cloying and it had a nice garlic zip to it. \n\nThis is the place to eat!"}
{"input": "Fun place to watch a sunset. It's like a picnic with out the basket! Great mix of locals and travelers. The lack of a dessert menu beyond the soft serve ice cream variations cost that 5th star. The fare is fair, the location makes up for it."}
{"input": "c can't figure out why this company has good reviews tried to set up an appointment for a cleaning he was very arrogant and rude wouldnot let me talk. just talked about his good reviews very poor customer service.  told me he don't give prices...that I had to. so I did and he hung  up. there are plenty of other cleaning companies  I can take this one off of my list\n\n.\n.."}
{"input": "Very stylish joint that's great for a casual date or dinner with a group of friends. I've had a few of their entrees and, while their sides can be a little bland, they dominate their meat dishes (considering they're going for a \"hip butcher shop\" vibe that shouldn't be too surprising).  My personal favorite is their pulled pork. \n\nThe outside patio is great for chilling in the evenings and having some local craft brews (a decent selection), but some areas of the patio have mosquito swarms so be wary of where you sit if you're planning on staying a while. Definitely would recommend."}
{"input": "This place kicks ass. The Munch King was very pleased with the mountain of food presented before him to scarf down. Service was great as well. I was so full after I left that I had to stop at the Columbian to take a big poo, because that's where the munch kings droppings belong!"}
{"input": "Whenever we make the trip over from Orlando.. We usually end up here.  I am a big fan of smaller intimate venues and this one does the trick.  Staff is great and the service is on point.  If you get a table.. request #4."}

{"input": "Lives up to the hype. Bring cash as no cards accepted (had to run cross st for atm). Lavendar honey, creole cream cheese, coffee and christmas. I loved the xmas flavor and Lavendar most!"}
{"input": "Probably the best coffee shop I've ever been to. Everything they make is great. Their pure black and draft latte are the best iced coffee drinks I've ever had, full stop. Their drip and espresso are also very tasty and strong. If you are in the area and love coffee you need to stop by this spot. \n\nOnly complaint: the line can get absurdly long. However, the staff here is some of the best around and the line moves very quickly. On that note, service here is also very friendly."}
{"input": "Loved it. The woman was very nice. I believe her name was Tracy. Most restaurants I go to value money over customers appreciation it is not the case for Sweet Taco™ they took our coupon even though they didn't have to. I would recommend getting a Burrito and then some doughnuts."}
{"input": "Stopped here while staying at the nearby Omni Hotel downtown Nashville, and not wanting to eat at the hotel, we decided to give this place a try since it is within walking distance from our hotel. It was opened 4 months ago, according to our waitress. \nWe had breakfast at this 24/7 diner. My husband had a quad combo of a huge moist pancake, perfectly done 4 strips of bacon, cook to order eggs (he chose egg white) and scrumptious potato fries. Loved it, and the portion was generous. \nI ordered the lox and bagel. This was just OK. It did not come with eggs or onion as expected. The smoked salmon was on the skimpy side for this order. \nI did like the endless strong coffee!"}
{"input": "OMG! What an amazing dinner experience. A friend recommended this place and it was incredible. We had two of their signature dishes -- the BBQ shrimp and bread pudding. This is a fantastic restaurant with great ambience and fantastic service. Highly recommend it if you're visiting New Orleans. Their fried green tomato appetizer was a great way to kick off the meal."}
{"input": "EAT HERE ON TUESDAY: the special is phenomenal. Call and order a large plain for pickup. Starting at 6pm, you will be charged the same amount as the time you called. Call in at 6:30pm, you get a large plain pizza for $6.30. Hard to beat. Pizza is quite good."}
{"input": "Really nice IHOP. Clearly it's very new. The service was very good. The wait was short. Lilliana, Liz and Kim were extremely attentive (they use teams of servers) for Sunday breakfast.  Since its an IHOP, it's not like there's anything all that different in the menu, but the food was really good. Nice and hot, not greasy. My wife had an omelette and I had the sampler. We would definitely eat here again. Apparently a lot of people come here for Birthday breakfasts as there were three times when staff came out clapping singing Happy Birthday. Ignore the reviewers that talk about bad smells and other nonsense. They only have one post so they have some kind of axe to grind. This place is fine."}
{"input": "I got a concrete that was supposed to have Reese's and banana. When I got it, it was melted and disgusting with literally 2 small pieces of Reese's and maybe 1/5 of a banana. Had a minty taste too which is not what I expected haha. Disappointing for my first time at this place. Won't be going back"}
{"input": "Went to Winco to purchase my weeks worth of groceries, It was about 6pm on a weekday. Spent about 45 minutes to an hour picking out my items, stood in a long line for about 20 minutes, when I got to the front of the line the cashier turned off her light and said I'm closed but were opening another check stand one over. Everyone that was behind me ran to the new checkstand and I was left in the back of the line for a 2nd time. Now it took 40 minutes to check out instead of 20. When I got home my ice cream was all melted. If this happens again I will walk out and let them put the groceries away."}
{"input": "The food is awesome here. I went with some hardcore meat eaters and they absolutely loved it. They didn't even miss the meat and thought that if there was meat added to their dishes, the food probably will not be the same."}
{"input": "I had the carrot cake.... Very disappointed tasted like licorice and baking soda cooking powder. It's too bad because everything looks so delicious :( also didn't like the chocolate chips in it either."}
{"input": "Got the geisha, fancy and kampai special rolls, and all 3 were great, we couldn't reach a consensus on the winner!"}
{"input": "This has been our go to pizza and wing place for years...we would drive 15 minutes for pick up because we lived where they didn't deliver. Now I live about 5 minutes away. Anyway the wings in the mild sauce are awesome...that mild sauce goes awesome with there buffalo chicken cheese steak or pizza. There fries are not my favorite because they are never crunchy but my family likes them. There BBQ chicken pizza is very good and not what you would get in any other pizza place (no red sauce). The chicken Caesar salad is HUGE, you get a ton of chicken...I've recently noticed they have had a price \nincrease, which isn't good, but they put pretty good food out so I'll keep going there."}
{"input": "Op suggestie van yelp- hier geweest op onze eerste avond in NOLA tijdens onze roadtrip (dag3). It's the best place. Wachttijden kunnen oplopen, maar waar Nederland vaak faliekant in faalt, gaat hier geweldig: er wordt door t personeel vlijmscherp in de gaten gehouden wie er aan de beurt is, zelfs voor de krukken aan de bar. Bijna gingen er mensen die later waren gearriveerd dan wij er met onze lang verwachte krukken vandoor, maar de barman regelde dit op sublieme wijze. Het moraal van dit verhaal- je raakt hier niet geïrriteerd omdat andere mensen voor schnitzelen. Ondertussen word je getrakteerd op de lekkerste live muziek en hebben ze er heerlijke cocktails en prima wijnen. Eten was ondergeschikt deze avond, maar wat we hadden was bijzonder goed. Dikke aanrader- wellicht reserveren als je niet van eindeloos wachten houdt."}
{"input": "Lunch is the best deal in town and it is our favorite resturant in New Orleans. Great service."}
{"input": "We were gonna eat next door at Neyow's next door per recommendations from a local but the wait was so long and it was pouring and we were hungry and ate here. Food wasn't bad, but we probably don't know the difference since we're not from around here. I'm sure a local could name several places similar to this that are better. The service was terrible. We had a table near the kitchen and I kept looking back into the kitchen and would see employees just bantering and not doing shit. It took way too long to get our food. I also had to ask for paper towels THREE TIMES before someone brought them. Horrific service."}
{"input": "Meun Fan Thai took over the old Cafe International spot and gave it a face lift and painted it a fresh minty green to match their Mesa location.  For Thai food, there are only two choices in Goleta.  My favorite is still Your Choice on State, but Meun Fan was passable if I don't feel like driving to Santa Barbara.  We started with a bunch of tiny fried spring rolls.  I wasn't a fan of them, too much wrapper and the filling was dry.  The pineapple coconut curry was also mediocre.  While the sauce was full of coconut flavor, I wish the meat was wok fried before hand instead of being directly boiled in the sauce.  The tofu pad see ew was tasty and there was visible caramelization from the wok without being too oily.  Overall, I am willing to give it another chance."}
{"input": "This was our second choice after finding out Rio Mar was closed for Mardi Gras week. We had a hell of a time getting here since it was on the other side of the parade from where we were staying.\n   Nonetheless, we had a great meal. \n    Service was spot on. Professional but not overbearing or obvious. \n    A little disappointed that they were out of two ingredients for one of their signature cocktails, but it WAS the day before Mardi Gras.\n   The bread and butter at the table was excellent. Crunchy outside, soft inside.\n   The beets salad was so much better and different from similarly named items at other restaurants. The greens literally tasted like they had been picked from a sun warmed field minutes before.\n    G's Choucroute was a meaty fiesta. He loved it. My crab ravioli was lovely with a delicate Meyer lemon sauce. \n    Bread pudding for dessert was just how we like it - sans raisins.\n    Truly a memorable meal. Way better than most hotel restaurants."}
{"input": "When my glasses broke, these folks were incredibly helpful.  They worked to get my prescription from my doctor in California.  They called me to let me know what was happening.  They told me about cheaper options.  They were friendly.  Can't say enough good things about them."}
{"input": "A++ for ambience. Very cozy English pub feel. Great drinks too - the bartenders here know how to mix 'em. That being said, the prices are steep (I paid $7 for a standard mixed drink) and the seating is limited."}
{"input": "I have no idea why this pretentious, dirty place is so popular... If you like terrible service, over priced wine, junky lawn chairs, and cock roaches crawling up your arm, you should definitely go here. Otherwise, you should save your time and money and go anywhere else."}
{"input": "i put off trying P & K because of the $12 price tag on the burger, even though it's been recommended.  yesterday i decided i'd try it out for drinks.  the mark up is almost as bad for drinks.  however the real turn off was the service.  the hostesses and waitresses were all aloof and unengaged.  hypothesis 1- management sought to hire snooty staff.  hypothesis 2- they are made to dress them in quite constraining clothes and they can hardly breathe enough to talk to customers.  who knows?"}
{"input": "One of the best restaurants I've been to while living in the Nashville area. First off Franklin is probably the nicest town in tennessee, it has a New England feel and maybe that is why I love it so much (being from there most of my life).\n\nNow the restaurant itself has excellent food and service, I have only been two times but I am yet to have anything that isn't absolutely delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly and was very tender (not the best I've ever had but close). Now the steak is good, but the shrimp and grits is spectacular. I would rank it in one of my top 20 meals of all time!! \n\nLast of all they have a great beer selection with many interesting choices on tap. This restaurant would get 5 stars from me, but it is to small and gets very crowded. Just go on a week night. You will have one of the best meals in Nashville!"}

{"input": "I ordered a last minute pumpkin pie for pick up the next morning, and it was not a problem for them.  The pie was ready when I showed up and delicious.  I had forgotten about this little gem, and when I walked in I wanted to buy all the treats they had on display - they were beautiful!  I think their pricing is beyond fair for their quality product.  \n\nJust a heads up on the phone orders - you must pay over the phone, not when you pick up."}
{"input": "Neighborhood dive bar, fun atmosphere. My vodka tonics were 80% ice."}
{"input": "Seooooooooooul Garden (does anyone else hear Soul Train in their head?) pretty decent Korean food, I love that you can grill at your table. Its fun, cooked the way you like it and its entertaining, but if someone doesn't like to cook, this may not be for them. Its a bit pricey, but most Korean restaurants in the area are. \n\nThe service is hit or miss, they are never rude, they just don't come by often. My friend ordered a glass of wine, wanted a second one half way through our meal, but we couldn't get it ordered. anyways the bill showed up and the wine was $10 (for very average table wine) on the menu it stated it was $4 dollars, we asked why and we got \"oh i don't understand, so sorry\" strange, as she spoke to us in English when we ordered and asked her questions before, but by this time we were over it, paid for our meal and left.\nOver all i enjoyed the food and the grilling of the BBQ but I would rather take a trip over to Charlotte Rd."}
{"input": "Loved the environment here. Chilled on a comfy sofa in the lounge area watching the Saints game. Seat yourself and the bar food options are pretty good. We had the buffalo wings, artichoke dip with pita, and the free with Yelp checkin homemade chips. Everything was hot and tasty. The wings are overpowered with sauce and is a good balance of hot, tangy, and crispy. The pickled veggies were tasty and crunchy. Loved the homemade chips. Not too overpowering. Our waitress Nicki was awesome. Made sure we got what we needed."}
{"input": "I LOVE this place. I have dreams about the Bananas Fosters Pancakes. Owners are super sweet and really try to take care of you. Place is small and the line is long so get there very early!"}
{"input": "Favorite salon in Nashville. Even though I have moved a little further away, I still go back. I've had haircuts, color, perm, and eyebrow waxing at the salon and have never had a complaint.

{"input": "Fantastic experience! I own a flower shop so I am kind of a hard one to please when I send flowers to others but this shop did a GREAT job! I called this afternoon and told the woman that answered the phone to do whatever they would like for x amount of money. My only request was that it was bright and cheery. They hit the nail on the head and delivered it quickly. THANK YOU :)"}
{"input": "I wish I could go back and time and not eat here. We waited 50 minutes for cold chips and salsa, they were stale and they didn't even have picode Gallo. They charge for them!\nThe burrito was cold, and when I asked they said they plate was suppose to be cold. Really? Cold rice and beans too? \nThe margarita was the only good thing and the 80's music."}
{"input": "This is everything I want in take out food - fresh, yummy, and relatively healthy. I also love that there is a good to go place in Northern Liberties that is convenient - there is not enough of that!"}
{"input": "Stupendous customer service, and exquisite food. My favorite is the Japanese pan noodles with marinated steak."}
{"input": "I've been ordering mostly take out and delivery from here for about 2 1/2 years.   As far as quick Chinese food goes, can't say enough good things.   First- the people who own it and work there daily are always incredibly nice and polite.  The food is great, meat is tender and veggies are very fresh and the shrimp are decent size. Portions are a good value .  The menu is a little more limited than a more upscale fine dining Chinese place but better than most fast food Chinese places.   Sometimes they do offer specials that aren't on the regular menu.   An extra nice feature is if I'm too lazy to leave the house, that they deliver!   Anyway, like I said above, I can't say enough good things about this restaurant and the folks who run it."}
{"input": "I was looking for a solution to tame my frizz not wanting to go the keratin route and ended up booking the phyto relaxer treatment here thinking it's just a smoothing treatment. I know, stupid me! My appointment was booked with Drea, the master stylist here. One look at my hair and she said I don't need to go the relaxer route. I just need some deep conditioning to hydrate my hair. I'm glad she just gave me good advice without trying to upsell treatments. The entire process took almost an hour and I just walked out of the salon with smooth nicely blow dried hair. Thanks Drea for understanding my attempt of reducing chemicals and unnecessarily stressing my hair."}
{"input": "Drum-roll please! Review #100 coming right up! \n\nI chose to review Starbucks as my 100th review because it is a guilty pleasure. Something that I only allow myself once a week. But something that I crave everyday! \n\nThis particular Starbucks is great. The baristas are always friendly and welcoming. The drinks are made correctly and quickly. I usually go with a Salted Caramel Hot Chocolate or Mocha. I also occasionally order the White Mocha. If you can't tell, I enjoy coffee that doesn't taste like coffee! In the summer their iced teas are the perfect thirst quencher! Their breakfast pastry items are always delicious. Try the Cranberry-Orange Scone and you will not be disappointed! Their breakfast sandwiches are unique and pretty tasty as well.\n\nI always choose to go in and place my order over sitting in the drive thru. The line for their drive thru is always ridiculously long. It's usually quicker to go in!"}
{"input": "Wow. Fantastic! Greek food at its finest! I had the lamb pita, which is phenomenal, with the fries, also phenomenal. The desserts and dips are also so great. Definitely a place to go to when in Nashville."}

{"input": "I've been to Michael's a couple of times now. First, it's important to note that they are 24 hours, which is nice. Their french onion soup is really great and so is the red velvet cake (if you can get it!). I've also had breakfast at Michael's and that was delicious too. The servers are really nice, perhaps just refill the water a bit more."}
{"input": "Had a great dinner at Spasso. My parents always request Oana and she is an awesome server-- answers questions, gives suggestions, and really knows the menu. We were quoted an hour wait, but were able to grab a high top in the bar area with no wait (they are full service).\n\nSpasso is Italian, but has its own little spin; it's not just the classic dishes of a typical Italian restaurant.\n\nThey start you off with bread and this delicious eggplant/pepper topping that is so refreshing. I typically love oil for bread, but love this alternative.\n\nI started with a Caesar salad which was perfect; just enough dressing, super fresh and I love the shaved Parmesan on top. For dinner I had pappardelle porcini which I think is the best item on the menu, it is thick pasta with sundried tomatoes, mushrooms and chicken with light sauce. It is totally delicious, and I had leftovers to have for lunch the next day.\n\nSpasso is definitely recommended for a great dinner in Media!"}
{"input": "Stayed for one week post Christmas. Unless you take adjoining rooms as a family, strangers conversations/coughs/clearing throats/fights/dogs barking etc feel as if they are in your bed with you. Only slept two out of seven nights after hotel cleared out after New Years. Connecting doors are very poorly insulated. Staff at hotel is superior...really excellent but Starwood needs to do something about insulating those doors. Have stayed many places with connecting doors and never experienced anything as bad. Poor materials used????"}
{"input": "Mind blown. This is the best shop I have ever experienced. Pulling up I see Porsche's and other luxury cars being fixed. They walked me through the extent of damage to my car and fixed it without ripping me off... and I see how they might have but they didn't. The price was amazing, the service was prompt and delivered as promised and most importantly the repair was executed perfectly. Unbelievable versus the work on a different side of the car performed by a different shop in the past. Thank you so much Philly Auto Body. No really, thank you so much. I am so pleased."}
{"input": "Loud loud loud!\n\nAnd the food sucks. They got new management not too long along, doubt they made an improvements."}

{"input": "A true hole in the wall with authentic middle eastern wraps. I love to go to this place, I used to go more often about 5-10 years ago but I got the chance to revisit a month or so back, boy didn't I miss it!\nI had the Mediterranean wrap, amazingly well done and cut meat to perfection with all the necessary adds on (such as feta, grape leaf dolma) to make sure all the middle eastern flavors dance in your mouth. I enjoyed it so much. The portion is perfect, not to big, not too small. You want to top that with a really awesome desert, you have to try the pistachio burma.... God I am coming to you."}
{"input": "I was a little nervous since this is my first time with LF and I didn't know what to expect. Tori was such a sweetheart. I showed her picture of the hairstyle I wanted, and she turned it into reality! At the end of my visit, she wrote down the products that she used. She also gave me some great suggestions about treating my hair type (fine & thin). The place was clean and modern. Parking was not an issue and I came on Saturday. It was a great experience!"}
{"input": "I love to bring Nick's virgins here.  I twist their arm to order a roast beef combo and gravy fries.  It arrives nice and quick and then I just sit back and watch and listen.  It starts with the rolling of the eyes and the huge smiles with roast beef sticking out of their mouth.  Then there is the OMG, OMG, sometimes muttered several times.  It's hard to understand them because their mouth is full.  \n\nThis is all before they try the gravy fries.  Then it really gets crazy.  You know they like it when they start comparing it to sex.\n\nAdd a cheap beer in an ice cold glass and it doesn't get any better than this!"}
{"input": "This was my 2nd time dining here. Once again received wonderful service from a great staff & amazing red cabbage. Tried a new bourbon, 4 roses I think. Love the variety of poisons to choose from!!! We'll surely be back again."}
{"input": "The food is good sometimes and sometimes subpar. I do love the chocolate chip cookies! Everything is overpriced for the quality. Also, they say they are open until 4, but when I went to grab a late lunch to go was informed that they close the kitchen at 2. I didn't see this info ANYWHERE online so ended up leaving upset with no food. Also, others have mentioned the lack of a bathroom. This is a serious issue. I was told to go to the library which I found out was closed. AFTER I friggin walked there. So, although I've gotten some good sandwiches and cookies, it just isn't worth the hassle or unreliability in quality to come here again."}
{"input": "What an amazing dinner!  The wonderful ambiance of this restaurant was enough for me, but when they brought out our food, I was mesmorized by the flavors!  The owner/chef came out to greet us and he shared a nice glass of limoncello with us.  You will not be disappointed in any way if you come here for dinner.  Everything we ate tasted like the chef prepared each dish with a little bit of \"love\" in every bite."}
{"input": "hmm deep fried balls. This was my first venture with takoyaki and I love Japanese food of any kind, so needless to say I was excited. I ordered the original and was served 6 deep fried balls of goodness. They were tasty, albeit doughy, but left a greasy aching not so fresh feeling. I needed to be drunk to really appreciate the grease. Since it was my first venture I'll say its worth a try, but buyer beware they're super heavy for being small balls of dough. \n\nThe curry chicken I had was a bit disappointing. I scarfed it down thanks to my near state of starvation, but found the roux too rich for my taste. Its worth another trip for japanese fast food- one of my faves and sorely lacking in the city, but its certainly not the best I've had..."}
{"input": "This was my 1st visit here.  Overall, not that impressed!  To start with parking was really bad!  There are good choices of beer on draft.  The food was ok.  We split a few appetizers.  The fried olives were very tasty & different!  The rest of the appetizers were ok: the blue cheese chips, calamari, & meat/cheese platter.  I would try this place again, but overall not thrilled!"}
{"input": "The food is very good and GREAT prices. The falafel is AMAZING. It also has a neat little market. Over all a good place to go if your in the area."}
{"input": "As a sushi restaurant in the midwest, I'm a big fan of Mizu's over other restaurants such as Wasabi, Tachibana, Fuji's, etc.  \nMizu has a completely different ambiance, the dim lighting and spacious dining makes it less traditional-Japanese and more modern and chic.  And since they are relatively new  (opened summer 2008 I believe) they are very clean.  \n\nI have been there a few times now and I have to the the Sex and the City, Hurricane, and their deep friend rolls are my favorites.  Their appetizers are also great (monkey brains- spicy stuffed mushrooms and soft shell crab).  Their fish are surprisingly very fresh for being so far from the ocean.  But if you'd like to try something different, their Korean dishes such as their Bulgogi and BBQ ribs (prepared in a Korean traditional way) are also a good way to go.\n\nAs for service, the servers and owner Eugene cannot be any more friendly.  They immediately recognize you if you go more than twice and they treat you like family."}
{"input": "I have used Steve twice now to do jobs at my house. Today I had him come by and replace some of the \"criss-cross\" redwood trellis that was used as a \"skirt\" around my deck. My puppy had chewed on it. Steve showed up with the right materials and tools and was done before no time. He is very handy, courteous, and does excellent work. I plan on using him again for my next \"fix-it\" job that I don't have the time, skills, or tools to do."}
{"input": "This place has the most amazing burger in philly. I've tried the village burger and the whiskey king. they're both amazing, but I don't know if spending an extra $15 for the foie gras is worth it. It is nice to have foie gras like maybe once a year. Although the village burger is only $11, after you add all the extra stuff that they charge ridiculous price for, like mushrooms ($5), the burger will come out to like $20. It's totally worth it though."}
{"input": "OK lunch buffet, but too oily.  i think weekend buffet is better than weekday."}
{"input": "Had lunch with girlfriends.  So happy to finally get down there; super yummy.  The cashier could have been more friendly and helpful, but I'll be back for sure!!!"}
{"input": "You'll enjoy it more if you go with your laid back friends who don't complain about waiting in lines and go with the flow. It's a cool atmosphere and the bands are sit and chill types. I just went with my husband and we only got 4 things before we were full, so make sure your crew is cool enough to share food. Also, even though it starts at 6, many trucks weren't ready til 6:30..longer line waits the later you go but everything is running."}
{"input": "Every time I go there the service is terrible nd today they didn't have anything except pulled port. Terrible service and terrible management"}
{"input": "I was very pleased with my Mac & Cheesy.  In and out pretty quick, friendly service.  I noticed a couple of draft selections but had mine to go."}
{"input": "Ordered the Swiss Chocolate pancakes and they were very good, but the chocolate was a bit sweet for my taste even without syrup. I think if I had scraped off a bit of the chocolate I would've given this place 5 stars. Maybe next time I'll try something different."}
{"input": "I went to the buffet for a basic breakfast because it was close to the cafes price.  I thought the buffet had good choices (although I didn't try everything and I realize that everyone's favorites might not be there).  I just had bacon, scrambled eggs, hash browns and a cinnamon roll.  Everything was at least satisfactory except the cinnamon roll, which was excellent.  It was the only roll I've found that is comparable to Cinnabon's.  Maybe the roll was a little soft, but that was more than made up for by the flavor.  I knew it would be bad, but I had to go back for seconds.  It took a lot of willpower not to just stay and eat roll after roll, especially since by that point they were effectively free.  I don't know how lunch and supper buffets are, which is why this os only four stars, but the cinnamon rolls are five stars in my book.  And the service was also very good."}
{"input": "This is only a review on their oysters because that's all I ever eat from here. They have the freshest, best tasting oysters ever! I asked our server what type of oysters they were and she didn't know but said she would ask someone. She never came back with the answer but that was ok. Oysters, D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S! I promise you you will not be disappointed!"}
{"input": "This was my first visit. Their food and service exceeded my expectations. I ordered a Greek salad with a chicken skewer and it was a generous serving and so fresh! I didn't realize it at the time but the owner was the cashier at our visit.\n\nIf you are a member of the L.A. Fitness in the same complex you also receive a 10% off discount which is what I received. You can order online at their website for take-out or call in your order for take-out too if you prefer. I opted to dine in even though we planned to take out.\n\nReally fresh. Really happy. Really pleased. I will be back."}
{"input": "Hotel is lovely. The front desk staff is extremely friendly and helpful. We were lucky enough to get a room away from the club so we had no problem sleeping. If you are looking for quiet stay somewhere else if you looking for fun this is perfect!"}
{"input": "Good, authentic food. Nice, clean environment. Good service. Not a significant beer selection but all in all a great first experience. We will return."}
{"input": "Mae's is the best Chinese restaurant on this east side. We tried Mae's due to some rude pricks across the street. Lol! But, luckily things happen for a reason. The environment, the decor, the air inside is so much better to start. The food taste so much more fresher, like it was not frozen or reheated. No greasy/oily after taste. The service is very good,  always right there when you need something, staff is very friendly. My family and I love Mae's and what makes it better are the prices. We're large family and we can do really well with just $60. Lunch specials are awesome! I encourage you to try Mae's."}
{"input": "I am a thin-crust kind of gal so this place is perfect. The pizza is fresh and the toppings are really creative. You can really taste the coal fire in the crust, it is perfectly thin and crispy. Also, the night I went, they were passing out \"new\" appetizers. I don't mind serving as a guinea pig as long as the food tastes good. \n\nI deducted one star because the place can be a bit cramped."}
{"input": "One of the best hotels I've ever had the pleasure of staying in. Clean, close to the airport, tasty continental breakfast, in-room fridge, spacious rooms, comfortable beds, and the friendliest staff ever. Matthew and Ricky were awesome! I definitely know where I'll be staying if I ever return to Reno."}
{"input": "M.L. Rose is a good place to throw a few beers back with dinner with friends with their large tables.  Their burgers are good but overpriced by at least 20%.  Why pay more for a burger here over the pharmacy or Burger Republic for more $$$ ?  They do have some TV's for sports too, but it's not the end all be all sports bar.  Overall not a bad place as they can cater to any crowd."}
{"input": "Literally the best meal I have ever eaten. I was in Nashville for a week for work and I went to Edley's three times and got the pulled pork platter every time. It's life changing. My boyfriend got the hot chicken plate every time and said that was also the best he'd ever had. This place is unreal. It's also not that expensive - only about $10 /platter and it comes with two sides and cornbread... and if you don't like cornbread you can swap it for another side. I did not love the mac and cheese but I pretty much always hate baked mac. The banana pudding is BOMB and the mashed potatoes are great too. I really don't think you could go wrong here."}
{"input": "Heard about the history of Dirty Frank's bar, thought it'd be cool to check it out, walked in and met what was a heinous bitch! Can't miss this old bartender, she has long stringy gray/blonde hair, full of tattoos and apparently liked some lumberjack looking man in the corner that day. She paid absolutely no attention to us and was full of attitude from the moment we sat down.\n\nUnless you were this tree trimmer you received the bare minimum amount of service. She was offended having to get you a drink because she had to walk away from the brawny man. If this was my bar she would be on the spot FIRED!!! This is supposed to be a historical bar and original speakeasy which could get a lot more business if this troll wasn't manning the place. It says a lot that on a Friday there were only three patrons when we walked in. \n\nI am tempted to paint over the murals of Frank Sinatra, Pope Francis even the frankfurter. This place is an embarrassment to all people named Frank and don't get me started on Frank Rizzo..."}
{"input": "The only reason they get two stars is that when we mentioned the 2 entrees we ordered were barely lukewarm, they took them off the bill.  Otherwise it would be one star.\n\nWe went with another couple, ordered wine and appetizers, which were alright but unremarkable.  All of the staff seemed frazzled and disorganized, stuff kept being dropped all over the place.  After we were served the entrees the waitress didn't check back until we called for the bill.\n\nThat's when the other couple and my not-shy wife complained, and the manager came over and apologized and did the right thing.\n\nWe ate at another Besh restaurant nearby, Domenica, the night before, and it was outstanding.  Go there instead."}
{"input": "I come to Indy every year for business and this place is great.food was delicious and this is st Elmo's sister rest. St Elmo's shrimps cóctel is great.make sure you make a reservation .I recommend."}
{"input": "This is a favorite place for me and my friends. We love sitting at the bar and indulging on half price sushi for lunch and dinner. We love their beer selection, and the place is trendy and a lot of fun. I do not like the fact that they include gratuity on the bill, and sometimes the 50 percent off seems to be closer to 47 percent... Now, since the rolls are small, one ends up spending about as much money as one would at a place with a regular price on sushi, but one ends up getting more food and a bigger variety of rolls."}
{"input": "I got some friends a room at the JW for the night as a gift the night of their wedding.  The only request I made of the front desk was that the bride and groom would not have to worry about any expenses.  2 of us separately went down and gave credit cards to the front desk to make sure everything was taken care of.  I got a phone call at 11:30 that night from the bride and groom saying that they were being asked to pay for parking.  Huge fail JW.  When I asked to talk to the manager, all he did was make excuses.  No apologies, no reassurance that they would be well taken care of for the rest of their stay.  If you want a seamless stay, this is not the place.  Huge disappointment."}

{"input": "the waiter we had made this the absolute worst dining experience i've ever had. as my party and i were ordering, our waiter would not stop rushing us. the wait for our food was far too long considering that it was 11 PM and there was hardly anybody there. when the food finally arrived, this guy just tossed our food on the table instead of carefully setting the hot plates down. also, a few dishes were not served the way we requested, mainly because we were rushed and the waiter probably had not written everything we said down. i'm a good person so i had to tip the guy but i really wanted to walk out with just paying whatever my bill was. will not be returning here."}
{"input": "Saw Dennis DeYoung there in November of 2013 a few days after Hurricane Sandy hit...\n\nExcellent time...\n\nThe staff and police there were very nice and they do not charge parking there...\n\nIt was well worth the 80 minute drive from Staten Island..."}
{"input": "Drifted far north of my orbit to try this gym out, I've already been to 66th Street location a few times. Still can't believe I get free gym as a SilverSneakers member. The huge open area here is different, and being a Saturday afternoon I thought it would be packed but no. Maybe they were all Christmas shopping.  \n\nIt's always inspiring to see people my age and older working out and taking care of themselves. Pleasant young man greets you at front desk. As other reviewers mention, no pool or sauna is missed, but they are a bargain for the pay-as-you-go price. All equipment is spotless and the floor shiny clean, what's not to like?\n\nIt's tucked into a strip mall at an angle from Publix, can't be seen from the highway so they should put up a tall sign."}

She's very talented, and if you show her a picture of the hairstyle you want, she will replicate it. Super friendly and nice, if you are a guy in the Uptown area looking for an awesome and trendy haircut/style, go to John Jay and ask for Ivy!"}
{"input": "I had the lunch special chicken with pesto sandwich with penne vodka. The penne vodka by itself would be given 4 stars because it was really good. However, the chicken had no seasoning on it. I'm not a fan of bland food. I like how they grill their chicken breast and if it had seasoning this would be a place I would go to regularly. Staff was very friendly. I can't wait to return for more penne vodka."}

{"input": "This place was amazing! I only tried their ice cream I really wanted to try the hot chocolate but didn't get a chance :(. Well the ice cream was great! The first night I came here I got a brownie sundae all for myself, brownie on the bottom and three scoops of ice cream topped with whipped cream and nuts. I finished it all happily! I chose pumpkin cake flavor which was delicious and smooth. I also got pralines and cream that was better than other praline ice creams. The Tennessee fudge was vanilla with fudge swirled it was good not too special. \n\nThe next time I came I got nutter butter ice cream that was really good had cookie pieces in it! I got the hot fudge topping over it and that was a great combination. \n\nThe service was great the workers were really nice and patient with me haha indecisive! They would joke around with me and let me sample all I wanted. Also no judgement for eating all the brownie sundae alone :) lol"}
{"input": "Pleasant place. Great service. Parking can get difficult but roadside parking with a few parking lots are available. Came here for restaurant week. Loved the salads , fresh buttery foccacio bread sticks(we asked for extras), and pizzas. Cauliflower pizza was our favourite wood fire taste to it..delicious. loved the deserts, devoured them. Antipasto platter was good first course but they mentioned roasted veggies as part of the dish but only thing roasted was cauliflower there was olives and roasted red pepper seemed out of the can. Nevertheless very tasty and finished the plate . Pasta was decent not outstanding."}
{"input": "The other night was my first experience at Jet's pizza. We ordered a large pepperoni sausage and schrooms with the regular hand tossed crust--they offer flavored crust but first time i believe you should nail the classic crust. Anyways--they were nice but the pizza was just so so--1st they used canned mushrooms which is unfortunate on several levels, pepperoni was ok and sausage was mediocre at best, also the crust was tough for it to be hand tossed. I spent $21 on a pie that would be equal to a papa johns (who i believe uses fresh schrooms) and pizza hut and i think would have been cheaper Their box says use better ingredients, i truly believe fresher is better. Really I expected more and definitely a better pie. Still searching for great Nashville pizza..."}
{"input": "Quick Read: Aside from the parking and occasional crowds -- this place is fantastic.\n\nThankfully, Buddy Brew is expanding -- a move that I hope will relieve some of the terrible parking issues. This place is a must-try in Tampa. The baristas are friendly, knowledgable, and efficient. The breakfast and lunch options are solidly tasty. The coffee is roasted with a level of care that I'm glad to see in Tampa. One of my absolute favorite places on the planet."}
{"input": "I am so done with this franchise. \n\n We had been ordering from them almost weekly since they opened and at first, their pizza was outstanding.  Plenty of toppings, spicy sauce, and a light crunchy crust.  Gradually, however, they declined in quality and quantity.  We quit ordering for many months.\n\nLast weekend, we gave it another try, but it has gotten worse.  Very skimpy toppings and the crust was slightly underdone.  The pizzas in the box looked nothing like the pics on the box.  I'd say our pizzas were equivalent to a $5 hot-n-ready from Little Caesar's, but we paid ~$15 each.\n\nSo very, very dissappointed."}
{"input": "My daughter and I went for breakfast, everything was great, my daughter had the chicken and waffles, I has an omelet, besides the food being delicious this place has great coffee, I'm a coffee snob and I love the coffee, our waiter kept my cup full, by the way our service was fantastic. The waiter recommended the happy hour so we will certainly go back not only for breakfast but luch and eventaully happy hour. We used a groupon on this visit but will certainly make this place a regular, at least twicw a month."}
{"input": "Well, now that the menu has expanded beyond the bar menu I'm less than impressed.\nThe food isn't fresh and most of what I've had wasn't even made to order.\nThe last time we went the service was not good, the food was less than average and the atmosphere is not what I would hope for for family dining.\nI wouldn't recommend Franklin's to anyone anymore. In fact I'd encourage friends to go somewhere else.\nI wish them all the best, but I won't be back."}
{"input": "I have been renting a home from Principal Property Management for 3 years.  Although we initially had some \"bumps\" and misunderstandings, it has overall been a very positive experience.  I have had some pretty major issues at my home with the AC and refrigerator going out and all was resolved by them in an efficient manner. Minor issues have been taken care of as well.  I have found them to be responsive to my needs and good about communicating. I think quite often a property manager can only do so much if the owner is not willing to help out or work with them. I realize now how important it is to have a professional property manager involved when renting a home.  I would rent a home from them again if I were to leave where I am."}
{"input": "Anyone who is scared of waxing like I was, go to this place! So professional and clean. I only waited a few minutes after my appointment time and the manager gave me complimentary creams and scrub. I couldn't believe how painless the wax was. Make sure to check Groupon before u make your first appointment!"}
{"input": "Slow...not as amazing the last few times I have been.  The tomatoes are still excellent, the fruit still the same, and the ideas still fresh.  But sometimes there are a stale lettuce pieces in the salad, and it can be like sit-down-and-read-a-book times. Still a great choice, but I think the sheer traffic from the groupon or whatever with one or two staff only can lead me to not be quite as delighted as before.  Still good as a local coffee place."}
{"input": "The food was great...however the wait staff was so bad it was incredible.  He not only insulted us as we complained about our 2 hour wait for our entrees, but insisted we weren't there that long and that we were just \"hangry\".  He said it's okay you're mad I understand you're hangry.  Never did a manager come to talk to us, even after a guest in our party went to talk to the chefs...they were dumbfounded...because we realized the kitchen never had our order!! One bad server shouldn't describe a restaurant, however the manager should have come and the server should accept his ignorance.  Really poor experience. :("}
{"input": "We had dinner here after a long day at the convention center.  We asked to sit in a quieter area, and they found us a nice table in a side room.  Service was attentive and professional.  Our waiter recommended the aged ribeye steak--\"best steak ever.\"  I didn't think I wanted an entire 18-ounce boneless, so he suggested we split it.  We did--certainly one of the \"best steaks ever\"--cooked perfectly medium rare and it was plenty for both of us.  Of course, we also had the signature shrimp cocktail (horseradish) and the iceberg lettuce wedge with crumbled bacon (very pancetta-like).   OK, iceberg wedge isn't the most exciting salad, but it's great when done well, which this was.  \n   My only disappointment was a wine list that had a very limited choice of medium-priced wines by the bottle, so wine selection took a while.  A small complaint, so I would rate H & I  4.5 stars if possible."}
{"input": "Will not return. Have given this location numerous second chances for improved customer service, but have observed no positive changes. Their drive thru service is terrible, both in terms of employee attitude and communication skills as well as their seriously lacking audio technology. This location is a complete disappointment and in need of a serious management overhaul."}
{"input": "Amazing beer and all for an amazing price! They have a great food truck outside , wonderful seating place under the trees. The BrewTenders are great! The severe told a funny story about the dickin cider customer. This bar reminds of us of our home brewery out of CO and NM. Awesome place. Come and enjoy!"}
{"input": "Eggplant Grinder and Greek salad are off the chain! The pizza is excellent!"}
{"input": "My Samsung 650 TV would not turn on. The red light in the front panel just goes on and off. I call Caden. First they charged $40.00 to come over to look at. Then he wrote a bill for $410.00 for repair. I guess I  look old and dumb, but he seems to be sincere. So I let him do the work. Next day, he said he had fixed the problem and will bring over. The TV came back and he gave me a 6 months warranty. I did some research on this problem and found out it is only the capacity problem. And it is relatively cheap to fix. The maximum will cost you for less than $180.00. So, watch out for Caden to sock to you. Call other first before you call him."}
{"input": "Wonderful, amazing, awesome convenience store. Best soft pretzels, great sandwiches, breakfast, breakfast burritos, chicken finger bowls over mac and cheese, drinks, teas, lemonades... I love it. I wish these were in California and/or New England."}
{"input": "Santorini Greek Island Grill is the best place to eat on the UCSB campus.  The food is fresh, well-prepared, and delicious.  The staff is efficient, courteous, and friendly (e.g., they call you \"my friend\").  The menu is interesting, varied, and contains many healthy options. (I like the chicken pita meal.)  The place is well-managed and you can see that everyone there takes pride in what they do.  The prices are reasonable.  These are some of the reasons I have been a loyal customer for the last two years and why I plan to continue coming to Santorini's for lunch in the future."}
{"input": "We liked this place a lot. We let our server pick the food\n& were very happy.  I got home and a few days later tried to make red cabbage the way they made it & I was not successfull .\nGood beer and great German hospitality."}
{"input": "the foods great, but no buflight on tap.i love the servers there , especially Jamie White, whose the best server. But again. Lack of Bud light is a big negative"}
{"input": "I absolutely love this great spot!  It is so hard to find real healthy food in the area...a lot of other restaurants claim they are healthy but greasy and loaded with garbage.  The staff is pleasant and helpful anytime I have a question about a particular menu item.  Keep up the good work boys!"}
{"input": "I was sort of unsure how to rate this place. I had a similar experience to Sara P. \nI joined in October. Got a GREAT workout. It was really enjoyable and definitely challenging. In December, emails about fraud, theft, employees leaving started coming.  My husband and I had purchased, but didn't get to use yet, 10 classes each for $85.  The new owners wouldn't recognize the 10 classes, but we can each have $85 credit. I was told we had till the end of Feb to covert the credit to classes but the owner said I may want to wait, as she offers specials in February. \nI email this week about a deal they have for 5 classes for $47. I get an email back that I can't use the credits for special deals.  What???\nI just want to use my credits, and walk away. It doesn't seem to me that this place is fixed at all.\nThere are plenty of places in Philadelphia where I can work out and not have to worry about all this drama.\nThe workout is a 4-5 star. The ethics is a 1."}
{"input": "I've been coming here for 15 years, by far and away my favorite place in Franklin. The tourists go to Loveless, the locals go to Barbara's."}
{"input": "Great job on my fill and gel pedicure. Even though it was close to closing, they took their time and even accommodated every request I had (I'm VERY particular). Clean environment and very friendly staff. Way more than I could have expected for a nail salon in a mall. P.S. My foot and hand massages afterwards were heavenly. I will DEFINITELY be back!!!"}
{"input": "So good! We have ordered from them almost every week since we tried it. We really like that everything tastes like food and you can tell it is all handmade. So delicious! We get mushrooms/onions/green peppers and they load on the veggies! Love it! They do deliver but it is just as easy to pick it up from their store \"back\" behind cultural swirl. I think it's good for our budget they aren't open Monday and Tuesday!"}
{"input": "Amazing, authentic, super delicious food. I know its authentic because my wife is Afghan and trust me, I know about authentic Afghan food. Try their Awshak or Buloni for appetizer and Qabuli pulao or Mutton kabob for main course and top it up with Firni for dessert. Excellent service, clean atmosphere and friendly hosts."}
{"input": "I dined here yesterday with two friends and we all ordered shrimp and grits. When our orders were brought out, the shrimp and grits were cold and hard and looked as if they had been sitting out for a while. We sent them back and asked if they could send us fresh grits but unfortunately the new grits were the same. It was pretty insulting that they would even think that we should eat food of that quality. I have visited this restaurant many times in my past visits to New Orleans, but I will not return."}
{"input": "What, no line for Sunday brunch!?  Awesome.  Just make sure you get there before the 11am rush.  Excellent coffee choices, ie medium or dark."}
{"input": "I am thoroughly impressed with Diva! The whole group of salon professionals are very good- starting with Tina!\nThey will bend over backwards to make you happy and fit you in as they are always busy! Prices are good!"}
{"input": "I was convinced I did not have one creative bone in my body....and now I want to paint and be more creative/artsy than ever!  Had a great girls night at Mimosa and a Masterpiece.  Fun, laid back experience...so don't let inexperience scare you away!  The instructor goes at a slow pace and is very helpful.  Love that the instructor encourages everyone to do their own version of the model painting rather than making an exact replica.  And of course nothing gets your creative juices flowing like a nice cocktail while channeling your inner artist.  This would be fun for a bachelorette party, birthday party, girls/moms night out, etc.   They add new paintings into their rotations of classes so stay updated on new things to create via the calendar on the website.  Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"input": "This place is a bit OTT (over the top) with some of their decor stuff, but maybe this is what life in a Carmel mansion in is all about. There are some fun items, but mostly really large, for some MTV Cribs show space. I liked a few of the chandeliers--it sorta feels like they are copying Restoration Hardware and a couple other places--can't quite put my finger on it. They have big animal statues, bed stuff, shelves, tables, some cool lights, and just lots of really odd exaggerated-size things. It's worth a wander around, but I'm not the target market."}
{"input": "I got a cheap haircut in NY for next to nothing and what do you know. it looks like some crazy chimp chewed up my hair and spat  it back on my raw scalp.\n\nSince I'm going for job interviews, I needed to look better and went to Domenick's. The guys were great, Robert cut my hair and did a clean job. Bill came out to $35. I'd give it a 4, but it was a little pricy for my taste, but I look human again. Don't know what you guys in Philly normally pay for a haircut."}
{"input": "Tucked away in a strip mall with a too-small parking lot, Ninja is an option for teppan yaki, noodles, or sushi.  It is bigger on the inside than it looks from the outside and the food prices are reasonable for this type of food.  There is a small sushi bar and a larger table area.\n\nThe evening I was there a nearby customer had impatient kids but the adults thoughtfully changed their order to take-out.  The owner is friendly and wanders the dining room greeting customers.  I would say it's the perfect place to eat before watching a move at Malco!"}
{"input": "This is probably the best restaurant in reno,nv we have had a wonderful experience. We and my wife had the shrimp and cat fish greens and loaded mashed potatoes and everything was so wonderful please do your self a favor and come here and enjoy the beautiful New Orleans vibe and great hospitality. I LOVE IT HERE."}
{"input": "Warm, friendly atmosphere and amazing product! We were first-time buyers there and will certainly be back. The ham sausage is excellent and the beef jerky is amazing! The rib eye steaks were also excellent. No more chain-store meat for us!"}
{"input": "Just ordered delivery from this nice pan-Asian restaurant. The food came quickly and the staff was extreme nice. Both the basil duck dish as well the kimchee dish were delicious. Diverse, different menu featuring less-common but very delicious Burmese, Malaysian, and Thai cuisines. \n\nA great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"input": "Well prepared, creative, fresh food in a casual fun atmosphere.  Good drinks.  Great prices."}
{"input": "Dined there a bit ago and can only remember truly delicious things about this restaurant. Everything that I tried and ordered was beyond my expectations and blew me away.\n\nBYOB, perfect atmosphere, and the chef, Konstantinos came out and introduced himself. Very personable man.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend this restaurant for making you feel at home in a Greek/Cypriot house when you are eating."}
{"input": "Completely UNDERWHELMED........ Love John Besh, but he wasn't fooling me--that was étouffée sauce on the shrimp and grits!  If I wanted étouffée, I would have order it. Food was okay, but VERY expensive."}
{"input": "Delicious and great prices! I had the brisket tacos, baked beans and mac n cheese. Pass on the mac and go for cornbread instead. The tacos were delicious, but if you want a bigger portion of the brisket, you'll have to be there around lunch. We went for dinner at 5 and they were nearly out of brisket. I had the oh honey! to drink and loved it. Nice ambience, no issue with service or waiting in line."}
{"input": "Never have I had such a delicious crepe outside of Paris, maybe even in Paris. I ordered 3 crepes ($30 Groupon), 2 savory, 1 sweet, and each was the essence of perfection. The crepe itself was soft with a warm buttery flavor and had a slight crispiness to the outside. Just incredible. The inside was well seasoned (savory) and had just the right balance of ingerdients.\n\nAfter taking the first bite, it was so good that I didn't know if I could stop myself from stuffing it into my mouth as fast a possible, but I knew that I should slow down to savor every morsel.\n\nThe service was perfection and the only drawback was the slightly high prices. But hey, you get what you pay for. I will definitely be coming back...and bringing all of my friends :)"}
{"input": "The BEST ice cream ever!!! So fresh and full of flavor, not to mention super cool how they make the rolled ice cream! Will be a stop every time I'm in town!"}
{"input": "The beef noodles was a bit too salty and the fried rice was a bit oily. But overall they are good. We liked the shrimp spring rolls a lot. It is one of the best we have tried. \n\nThe place could have earned higher points. But I have to give it a three stars because of the chaotic seating arrangement. The owner gave tables to people behind us despite we reminded the him and the staff. Perhaps that is what you get when you go to a teeny tiny Chinese restaurant during a long weekend."}
{"input": "Amazing live Jazz music. No alcohol. No food. Just JAZZ. This place really shows NOLA city culture off. Tickets are $15."}
{"input": "So I went back to Buff for a complimentary mani (gel) and pedi.  I must say this time was definitely an improvement over the previous time I went for a mani/pedi.  The gel lasted like it should and my fingers didn't hurt.  I still love going there to get waxes - and I'm glad I had a better mani/pedi experience the second time around."}
{"input": "The atmosphere is very calm and clean. The waitstaff is attentive and the sushi is quite good.\n\nThe \"chef's specials\" rolls are creative and delivered with artistic flair. \n\nThere was a little chaos as the orders were delivered since basically everything arrived at once (even the things called appetizers) and there were no extra plates offered so you had to kind of just eat over your little soy sauce tray. \n\nThe only rub is that we wanted to order bento boxes for our kids and substitute the Shrimp Tempura for the Shrimp Teryaki and the waiter returned to say that this was not possible. Ok, fine. So we ordered Shrimp Tempura entrees instead. It was kind of a silly thing since the kids like the bento boxes but obviously isn't going to be a factor for most people. \n\nIt's BYOB so bring your own beer or wine and they'll gladly bring you glasses to drink it."}
{"input": "This was a great place to have brunch with the family. It is very clean and the staff were great. I love the decor!! Plus, my four year old actually ate here!!! That is a HUGE deal. He doesn't like anything."}
{"input": "I've had the pleasure of experiencing Han Dynasty's exquisite Sichuan cuisine in the Old City and University City locations. Today a friend and I decided to try something new. We tried Han Dynasty Cherry Hill. \n\nGood: pea leaves with garlic. These were excellent! Get these! In addition, get the spicy crispy cucumbers\n\nCold Noodles in Chili Oil: I learned that the taste of the cold noodles depends on the master chef. IMHO, the master chef at the U City location makes a better cold noodle in chili oil dish\n\nGarlic Sauce Style: my friend had this. She said it tasted better at the Old City location.\n\nAnts Climbing a Tree: tasteless\n\nPlease read: we expressed our dissatisfaction to the General Manager and he was incredibly responsive. I give the manager 5 stars."}
{"input": "This place was so yummy and decently priced. I felt that the escargot would have been better as traditional escargot but the playing was nice. You can dine with the ghost (former owner of the mansion who killed himself on their 2nd floor) for an additional $50. The table is by itself in a cold dungeony room."}
{"input": "After living in our house for 10 years, with one of us (not me) being a semi-hoarder, our garage had turned into a disaster of junk and trash and empty boxes.  So when the time came to clean it up before we put our house on the market I knew I was going to need to hire someone.  Not to mention I also had 2 mattress sets, a room of carpet, a broken sofa AND an old door that needed to be dumped. \n\nCalled Tobey's and was asked to text the information about my job to them.  Scheduled an appointment on my day off. They arrived a little after 9am and left around 1130 and did a great job of hauling off everything! What a weight off my shoulders to not have to worry about all of that crap. \n\nWould def recommend Tobey's and if we were to need their services again in the Reno/Sparks area I would totally hire them again!\n\nThanks!"}
{"input": "I've been generally pleased with the fare at Chef's Market (except for a lemon cake I had once--the cake was great and frosting was too much).\n\nGreat variety."}
{"input": "This place was absolutely awesome. 75 cent oysters. After 2 dozen I moved to the excellent cheesy grits. Great place to eat. Even better during happy hour."}
{"input": "If you're going to a show at the Union Transfer / Underground Arts / Electric Factory, then this bar is in a nice location for a couple of beers and food. I don't think I would make a trip across town to come and drink here, but I would definitely stop by again before a show.\n\nFood: \nMenu is a small selection of typical bar food, but with what little they have, they do it well and tastefully. The brat plate was a nice, filling $15 deal if you want a little bit of everything. Fish & chips came out freshly fried and piping hot. Definitely several notches higher than your average bar food.\n\nDrinks: \nBeer centric, but it's not like you can't get wine and cocktails...just noticeably limited.\n\nSpace: \nCozy, so it can get crowded pretty easily -- not really a place to hang out all night."}
{"input": "I would NEVER stay here again. Maybe they gave us a crappy room because I used reward points. I used to travel approx 120 nights a year for work and was loyal to the IHG chain. Sadly, some locations do not warrant a return visit - this is one of them. \n\nIt's been about a month so I may be forgetting some details but what is clear in my memory is not to return. The lobby was updated and seemed nice and the room itself had a basic update. However, the toilet was set at an awkward angle and the bathroom ceiling sprinkler and fixtures were rusting. \n\nThe worst part was waking up to what sounded like a live porno in a neighboring room. Yuck. \n\nIt was nice being close to some great Italian restaurants but you couldn't pay me to stay here again."}
{"input": "Visiting from Los Angeles, some friends recommended District Donuts for their creative donuts (specifically their Vietnamese iced coffee donut) and their sliders. I have to say, I'm not as impressed as I thought I would be. \n\nWalking into district donuts, you get a very clean and nice hipster vibe. Their \"extra fancy\" donuts are on display by the cashier. They're very nicely decorated and look delicious.\n\nWe ordered the pork belly sliders, Vietnamese iced coffee donut, brown butter donut, coffee, chocolate milk, and an espresso shot. The caffeine was nothing to write home about but the chocolate milk was very good - just sweet enough.\n\nThe pork belly slider in my opinion wasn't very good. It needed more daikon radish and the cut of pork belly wasn't fatty enough.\n\nThe donuts are very sweet. Almost too sweet. The Vietnamese coffee donut didn't have enough coffee flavor to it. I felt like it didn't really capture the essence of what it purported to be."}
{"input": "Simply put .. Awesome . Surrounded by lakes , the apartment complex has very peaceful environment . The staff of the leasing office are very helpful and friendly. I had very nice experience staying here and would recommend the apartment to anyone who is looking for peaceful  stay in St. Petersburg,FL."}
{"input": "I held my husband's surprise birthday party for about 35 people in the basement bar at Black Sheep. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. From the first call I placed to inquire about hosting the party and spoke with James, the owner, to the night of the party where Adam, our bartender, made sure all went smoothly, everyone I dealt with was fantastic. Overall, a great experience."}
{"input": "This my kind of place.\nYou have to understand that there are several restaurants around this area, this one is very good albeit a minimalist one.\nIf you enjoy good service, and good food, without the frills, this is definitely your place."}
{"input": "LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place! The margaritas are consistently delicious and refreshing. The host, Eric, is amazing, friendly, and makes the trip worth it. The atmosphere is laid back and comfortable.  3 can share the nachos, which are delicious. The quesadillas are to-die-for. The brunch is delicious. The Sangria is awesome...can you tell I LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"input": "This place is small, actually it's tiny. But it's cool! check out the wall mural ! \n\nI like their business philosophy, check it out on the back of their menu. \n\nAs for the food, Asian fusion , that's all I can tell you. \n\nMiso Ramen - The broth was actually decent, it's creamy and tasty. The pork shoulder falls apart with the grab of chopsticks. nicely done. \n\nBrisket Ramen - two big slices of Brisket, quantity over powers quality. To be honest Brisket was flavorless. This bowl contains Kimichi, kimichi with ramen how interesting."}
{"input": "I don't know if you can see it from the pic I uploaded but there's sauce covered straws, hair, crumbs and red soda all over the table they sat us at. I asked the waitress to clean it up. She wouldn't. We left before getting our food. Super gross."}
{"input": "I once went to this Gavi and it was fine.  Second time though it was mostly empty, sat down, waited 15 minutes without service and left.  Haven't been going back and have been telling everyone I know not to go there."}
{"input": "Ordered out from here last night.  Nothing spectacular, but the food was good and plentiful.  I wouldn't drive all the way across town for it, but since it's in the neighborhood, I may be spending more time here experimenting on other food.  I had the chicken Parmesan (sans cheese).  I really wanted the spaghetti with it, but they ran out before we picked it up, so it came with Lasagna.  It was pretty tasty.  If you are ordering over the phone, be sure to ask them what they have."}
{"input": "Breakfast on Sunday was pretty good. Cinnamon muffin was less than fresh. It's close it's cheap so I'll be back"}
{"input": "This is the worst Mexican food I've ever had. The salsa definitely comes from a jar. My friend got an agave sweetened margarita for $9 and we all thought it tasted like straight agave nectar and water. The cheese on the tacos looks like Kraft cheese from a bag, and the only other topping was iceberg lettuce. You might be able to find better food at a gas station."}
{"input": "This place is a joke. First, we had to go through 3 different people just to place a to-go order even though it wasn't busy. Then we waited 25 minutes for them to make 2 wedge salads. We got no apology. Total BS."}
{"input": "Maybe I'm not twenty anymore but this place encouraged me to try on a smashing dress, for the price of two cocktails it was mine.  I may never wear the dress again, but it was made for NOLA , funky and sassy. A dress with an attitude can't be dealt a bad compliment. Chocolate was calling my name cutting my exploration time, but I'll be back."}
{"input": "This is not a bar you hang around in...go in, get a hand grenade and go. And only drink one. I promise, you'll thank me for that advice! They are so strong that you'll be buzzed by the time you reach the end of Bourbon. If you do want to hang out and stay close to the hand grenades, go to The Funky Pirate and listen to Big Al Carson. It's an experience."}
{"input": "This is probably the best place to go if you need \"notions\" (I think I'm using that term correctly.  I sew, but know no official terminology).  Buttons, zippers, elastic, cords, bias tape, pins, the stuff you always need but never have- this stuff is SEW cheap- see what I did there...\n\nIn Pittsburgh, I feel pretty limited to shopping for fabric at JoAnn Fabric.  This place didn't WOW me in terms of fabric selection but was a little cheaper than what I'm used to.  This is probably the only place on Fabric Row I'd return to.  Maybe my hopes were just up too high; I was expected fabric at like $2 a yard.  This is no LA/NYC fabric shop but it got the job done."}
{"input": "Excellent service. The food seemed really fresh. Guac comes complimentary (AS IT SHOULD). The design of the place is super cute and it looks pretty clean. If you like Chipotle, you need to level up and eat here. Quit playin."}
{"input": "My BBQ chicken pizza and greek salad were both delicious but I was super disappointed in the beer selection. I've come to expect great craft beer at Mellow Mushroom locations and these guys didn't even have an Abita Big Easy IPA. The best choice was a Dale's Pale Ale out of a can, which is perfectly fine, but with all the delicious local beer it was not at all what I was hoping for. At minimum they should have some bottles/cans from Parish, Great Raft, Urban South, Abita, NOLA, etc..."}
{"input": "Spicy noodle (drunken noodle) was very good. Both of our curries: red curry with chicken and Panang curry with beef left a lot to be desired. They were runny and the taste was off. \n\nMy Thai iced tea was good. \n\nService was mediocre. It was very challenging to get her attention. She told us we could each get glasses of water but only brought one. She brought a second glass for another person after the meal was over. She would never make eye contact or refill drinks."}
{"input": "Purchased a Groupon for dinner, but turns out it was take-out, so we saved it for another time. The ambience of the restaurant is very nice. Very quiet, clean, and new-looking. Our server was very friendly and polite, and checked in with us quite often. A couple walked in while we were dining, and the server recognized them and was chatting with them for quite some time - they definitely put in the effort to get to know their customers. The sushi, rolls in particular, was priced a little higher than your average sushi take-out, but definitely worth it. Their food is fresh, and their menu selection is great. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for good quality sushi. Easily our new go-to spot."}
{"input": "Gray Brothers has been in Mooresville for 10,000 years serving up tasty cafeteria style food on clean white plates to Hoosiers and their guests from around the country. Old school ladies in orthopaedic shoes, brown aprons and hair nets will ladle out homestyle sides (mashed potatoes, corn or green beans) next to comfort food main dishes (meatloaf, fried chicken or baked fish) from behind steamy sneeze guards as you make your way down the buffet line which is approximately three miles long. It's a little known secret that there's an old timey dry goods store just behind the coat rack in the main lobby where one can stock up on provisions or barter pelts with real Mooresville natives. In the winter, children can use the yellow 6x4 foot cafeteria tray to go sledding down hills behind the Kroger across the street. \n\nOh, you're not goin anywhere without pie! Tis a fact that one can legally marry a pecan pie or peach cobbler on the other side of the bridge just south of Gray Brothers Cafeteria."}
{"input": "Headed to Franklin TN for the day from our weekend in Nashville.  Read about this location on yelp and looking for a good hearty breakfast....great choice.  Busy busy place but, still the service was attentive and friendly.  Neat concept of a location....looks like a restaurant....or bar with stage....or a grocery store.  It's really cool!   Food was so flavorful, hot and just all over great.  Good portions and great options....menu items and a breakfast buffet....can't go wrong.\n\nDefintely, would recommend!!"}
{"input": "I was in so much pain from my accident, waited for 2 hours and was seen for 5 minutes and discharged with no medications to help me recover. If you are looking for a compassionate care, this is not the place to get it."}
{"input": "Let's start by saying our date night was amazing! Atmosphere was great and the staff was super friendly. Food and drinks on point and very affordable. Portion sizes are perfect. Great place to come!"}
{"input": "Stopped in on a Saturday night that wasn't particularly crowded.  Service was definitely slow - 45+ minutes for entrees.  Our table was overflowing with empty glasses and plates - not bus service to make room or clear dishes.  Had to track down our waiter to get our check at the end of the night.  Ordered the $14 lamb burger medium rare that came out gray, dried out and seriously overcooked.  Would have sent it back but just took too long to make the first one. Other entrees for dining companions were 2-3 star.  Beers (tap) were $7-$8 each.  Do yourself a favor - go next door to McMenamin's and get a better selection of beer, for more realistic pricing, and a $9 burger that is twice the size of what they serve here."}
{"input": "Delicious!  Very nice servers. Loved the eggplant and carrot appetizer with pita. I asked for cucumber as substitute. Yummy."}
{"input": "I was prepared for a tourist trap given the history and reviews, but ended up really liking this place.  We went around 9:30 pm on a Sunday so it wasn't crowded.  The menu is simple and good.  The marinara was flavorful without being sweet.  I like that the mushrooms in the pasta were fresh not canned, as with other old school places in Italian Market.  My friend had an excellent pasta with shrimp and artichokes.  I don't have a need to go to Villa Roma anymore since finding this place."}
{"input": "Visited Mangia for the first time today with my girlfriend. What a pleasant experience! Great drinks, amazing food, and friendly service. Would highly recommend. Glad to have great Italian food on this side of eighth Avenue!"}
{"input": "We went here for lunch today and it was AMAZING. I'm not kidding when I say it's the best chicken fettuccine alfredo I've ever had. Our waitress was super nice, and asked a little bit about what we were doing in New Orleans. She gave us some things to do around the area too! It's a great location and seriously, the food is to die for! Everyone needs to come eat here! Plus, the inside is so cute!!"}
{"input": "Staff was very nice and helpful but we were extremely disappointed with the food. We ordered Eggplant Parmesan in which tasted like it came out of the frozen section from the grocery store and the spaghetti sauce tasted bitter as if they poured it out of the jar. We were totally disappoint in the food."}
{"input": "I have never had a bad meal here. Their special burgers have been killer. I still dream about the burger with egg and truffle oil. Great juke box and friendly staff."}
{"input": "Great pizza as always. I grew up in maryland and this location is just as good as the ones up there. the sauce is sweet, which i usually don't like, but they pull it off. its like pizza candy. this location brings down another taste from the north in the form of Boylan's Birch Beer and a couple others. i only really noticed the birch beer because its hard to find. A four pack is $6.49 or something. will be returning if i can make the 40 minute drive from clearwater again. open one closer to me please."}
{"input": "Two very good experiences.  Excellent burger and very good pulled pork.  Wife loved her egg white and goat cheese omlette.  Solid beer list and a good spicy bloody Mary.  Also had great service and an ecclectic play list."}
{"input": "Found them on YELP! Awesome Men's barber. This is a true men's high end barber. They didn't miss any amenity! Awesome barbers, Jamie Nicole was awesome, especially for her first time cutting my hair it was perfect! Highly Recommended!"}
{"input": "I had a most-delicious bagel sandwich this morning - pork roll, egg and cheese on an everything bagel. The price was very fair - $4.23 - and the bagels are made on site each day. They seem understaffed so hopefully they get some more staff to keep up with the crowds."}
{"input": "Twice I have wanted to order through the Internet and twice it has not worked. The first time I never even got my order. The second time I called and was told, \" oh yeah that happens\". And then, if you want to order it will be well over an hour for a pizza. WTF? This is pathetic. I really want to support locally owned businesses but not like this. I will gladly walk to Theo's and get a pizza before I try these guys again. Too bad, you're ruining local,business. I will NEVER EVER ORDER AGAIN."}
{"input": "Best coffee I've had in chilly, hands down.  Never tasted a latte like this.  Food was fantastic as well, had the gurt with granola and berries, tasted fresh.  I don't know what their secret is but I must find out before I die, it really is the best."}
{"input": "At first I thought the prices here were pretty decent, but then I realized that they charge for every add on- chips/salsa, rice and beans, etc. I would be fine with this if the food was exceptional, but it is subpar. Both times I've been here, my side order of rice has been hard and dry, and burritos sad and limp. Additionally, the waitress we've had the two times going there had a horrible attitude. The only thing that saves this place is the guac, and the strong margaritas. Their strategy must be to get people drunk enough to not care about what they're eating and the rude service."}
{"input": "Great little place for HH! Oysters are HUGE! Service was great and the drinks delicious."}
{"input": "I love this place, service is fast and I find myself there every-time I'm in center city. During lunch time they have a great lunch special, they aren't the biggest rolls I have seen but they sure are delicious. From the outside it's blends in with the rest of the buildings but it so nice on the inside. My interaction with the staff has always been pleasant and I do love the little candy in the front next to the register. My order always consist of the sandwich roll and the cooked spicy scallop roll ( I have tried other but those two are my favorite). The lunch special come with either 2 rolls of 3 rolls with your choice of salad or soup. If you are looking for a nice place to eat for cheap this would be it"}
{"input": "After my last visit I said I wouldn't go back here again, but sadly I found myself needing a doctor over Memorial Day weekend and didn't want to go to an ER. \n\nI sat in the waiting room for 20 minutes before leaving without being seen. It seems that even though they were open, the doctor decided not to show up. I did a Google search and found a different clinic that took my insurance. I had to drive half an hour but I was seen by a doctor.\n\nI will never go to Advanced Urgent Care again. I'd rather drive a half hour and know I'll have good service than drive five minutes for nothing."}
{"input": "I took the beginning class there, and I loved it. It was perfectly paced, and though the moves weren't difficult, they really stretched me in places I didn't know existed! I even broke a small sweat! But I felt great afterwards! The studio is clean, and I like that I can buy some Beyond Organic food items there too."}
{"input": "I love this place!! It's so clean to start. The family and employees are so friendly and always working to clean and keep the restaurant looking nice. The food is excellent. Authentic and lots of flavor. Portions are big as well. It's good to finally have some good Mexican food in this area that isn't a huge chain. \n\nLove going there it has become our go to spot."}
{"input": "nice restaurant, but small. the lighting is not good for us 40+...smile. there were 6 of us and we were at a back table, quite snug. I had buffalo wings & fries, which were good. they could have taken the tips off though. my family members had salmon, a burger, & duck. they enjoyed their meals.  I may be back for the wings."}
{"input": "I enjoy cooking, and MD market is one of the top oriental markets around.. I have shopped most all places in the area. Always clean, fresh produce,  meats and seafood. Staff has always been helpful and I can say I have found things great overall."}
{"input": "Its nice to see Thai's style ice cream here in Tampa. Its worth the wait just don't come during the peak time. Located  near USF's campus and the price is pretty okay. I will be back."}
{"input": "Absolutely disgusting. Do yourself a favor and never order from here. Food is terrible"}
{"input": "Kung Fu Noodle has really authentic Chinese dishes and in general, they're really good. We had Dan Dan noodles, seaweed salad, the \"hamburger,\" and the beef \"burrito\". All of them were really tasty. \n\nA few things I didn't like:\nThe seaweed salad and burrito had A LOT of cilantro. I understand having a few for taste, but there were so much that I couldn't get the cilantro taste out of my mouth.\nThe \"hamburger\" bun was cold and hard. The taste wasn't bad, and I wish the kitchen could have toast it or grill it a bit. \nService was not there yet. The girls were friendly enough, but they were so overwhelmed that they didn't bring us water or chopsticks. They could need further training or a more efficient system."}
{"input": "My family has come here for years! Food is always the same and taste amazing! Super friendly and welcoming!"}
{"input": "Top notch street tacos, great service and hand made horchata made this a top notch stop"}
{"input": "I'm dying to try the Sunday night 14 course \"meze\" for $35 sometime soon! The food is fantastic and it's BYOB so you can bring a fantastic bottle of wine you can actually afford. Specials are always inventive and delicious! The atmosphere is bustling yet cozy. You can't go wrong with the Cyprus breakfast--eggs, halloumi, and ham! I had amazing duck egg with a spicy yogurt and merguez sausage for my birthday brunch a few years ago which I still crave. The grilled octopus is awesome, but my favorite may be the \"manti\" which are spicy lamb dumplings! If the dips of the day include the pumpkin-feta dip definitely order it! It's amazing. Their baklava and cardamom ice cream are heavenly. Whenever I walk by and see people on the street enjoying their meals and wine, the corner is so inviting! I also love to inspect the quirky decor and handwritten signs. These are just the things that make Kanella uniquely special."}
{"input": "This small quaint place is a gem! I found this restaurant on Groupon. The food was delicious. I really enjoyed the calm atmosphere, music and art on the walls. The customer service was excellent. The food was flavorful!"}
{"input": "My boyfriend and I came down to the beach from our Orlando trip for the day and couldn't help but stop by. They have a great outside look being right by the beach and they even had live music. It was a Sunday afternoon and not very busy. Our waitress Sierra was very attentive and sweet! I forgot the drink she recommended, but they were super good. My boyfriend and i had two each. The food was the best we had while in Florida! It was presented well and tasted delicious. I thought the avocado egg rolls were a must try and was not disappointed. My shrimp and grits and my boyfriend's burger were great too! Great experience at Salty's!!"}
{"input": "What a treat!  Unplugged brings a great wine bar to downtown Tucson.  I've been here multiple times, and I love the wine selection they have.  The ambiance is beautiful, and the bites are delicious!  I could go on ranting about how great it is, but you'll have to try for yourself!"}
{"input": "Even though theres nothing ostensibly stand-out about 45, I spend quite a bit of time here. This is definitely a \"Cheers\" bar, where everybody knows your name. If you can make out their face through the haze of cigarette smoke, that is. Personally, the smoke doesn't bother me, though i have plenty of friends who refuse to go here for that reason. \n\nI just love the laid back, dive-y vibe. On game days, theres always a spread of food to help yourself to, which is such a nice tradition that you rarely see in bars now. During baseball season, well, I hope you're a Red Sox fan. If not, keep your allegiances quiet, lol. And theres often a food truck parked out front. Yum! A great pre or post show stop if you're seeing music at Tipitinas, which is just down the street."}
{"input": "Great personal service . Clean environment and great working machines.  Plenty of room for folding clothes. Sandy was a great help when I forgot my hangers.  Thx.  Shout out to Deb also."}
{"input": "We loved the food, service and decor! The minute we walked in for a late lunch we were greeted with a huge smile and a warm welcome from the manager. Our server, Christina (i think that was her name) was delightful. The beer selection was great. We had the chicken rabe sandwhich and pepperoni pizza. The sandwhich was very good, on tasty foccacia bread. The pizza was superb!  We love the \"well done\" taste. We will definately be back. One problem we may have is our 7 year old is very picky and we didn't see a chidren's menu."}
{"input": "I can not believe on how unprofessional we were treated today by you shift manager Ashley at the original location. Food was ordered for a couple of girls in our office and when dealing with Ashley the young lady from our office got into a long drawn out convo with her and they had words. \nI was not the one on the phone call, so I did not think I was going to be treated poorly, but I was.  I don\\'t understand why Ashley would not give us her first name unless she was concerned about something. By her doing so, it made myself and a co worker that came in with me feel as if something was probably done to our food. The guys in the kitchen were watching us curiously, trying to hold back from laughing as if maybe they spit in the food. \nI called the owner David to discuss all of this and he did not take the call or call me back"}
{"input": "Haven't been back for quite awhile (they had a kitchen fire late in 2015) but the return visit was as good as the last. The atmosphere in the bar area (we have not eaten in the dining room) is great, with friendly servers and bartenders. Sitting at a hight top gave us a great vantage point to observe the bar action as well as the main entrance.\n\nIn addition to a great bar menu it is possible to order off the main menu as well. Carol opted for a light meal and had truffled fries and pork belly tacos. The tacos had freshly prepared pickled onions on top that were terrific. The fries were hot, crispy and had a great taste. I chose the fried chicken, something I would not normally order and it was excellent! The chicken came with collard greens and bacon, again, something I wouldn't normally order. I forgot to mention that the meal started off with some very good bread.\n\nMy only complaint is that their beer selection is lacking - they need to add some craft beers, local if possible."}
{"input": "Best one stop print shop! All the employees here are extremely knowledgeable, helpful and friendly. These guys have made me art for my home, A-frames for my business and so much more. The quality on everything that I've received is top notch and I have no complaints about pricing. This is the only place I go to for any of my advertising."}
{"input": "Unbelievable! The best breakfast I have ever had in my life!!!! The atmosphere was quaint and cozy, the staff was delightful and friendly and the food was out of this world.\nBreakfast is my favorite meal and I always enjoy going out but since moving to the south my breakfast journeys have been sorely disappointing.  I found The Garden via Yelp and I am so thankful!!!\nI don't eat beef or pork so many fudged are out of the realm of possibility for me, but not here! Turkey ham and cheese omelette!! Yum! Boyfriend has turkey sausage fiesta omelette! Yum! And we shared the amazing Bananas Foster pancakes, yum!!! This was the holy grail of breakfast!!!!"}
{"input": "The red beans and rice was good. The chicken was good. They would probably make more money if they let a person substitute and I'm not saying it has to be difficult. If I get a 2 piece white, why can't I get two wings? Instead of breast and wing, just so simple and your customer is happy!!I also heard they are running a special menu during Essence Fest to make life more difficult!!"}
{"input": "It isn't often you walk off the street and find a place that fits perfectly to what you were looking for. Following the game we were looking for a wine bar to enjoy a glass of wine and an appetizer. The reviews were good so we made our way here. \nThis place does not disappoint and Glenn has it figured out. Great service, great wine and great food. \nWe had the chorizo sausage and a few glasses of an amazing Tempranillo wine. The food was amazing but what was better was the atmosphere of the place, like having dinner with friends in the kitchen. \nThis place is great for sharing with fantastic tapas and an awesome wine selection. Most of all there is Glenn, he will make you feel at home right in his kitchen."}
{"input": "Love in n out. There's just a mood for in n out that you have to fulfill sometimes.\n\nWhat can I say. 4 patties animal style bruh"}
{"input": "Go here for breakfast almost every weekend. Great huevos rancheros and enchiladas montadas. They are willing to make something special if you want."}
{"input": "When my bf and I looked at the rating for this place I thought, wow how come we've never gone there? Then, we finally visited Prohibition Taproom: it is a true beer place! No wonder -- I'm not a beer person.\n\nBut the experience was good. From my point of view, it looked like heaven for the beer-and-sports people. \n\nI liked the vibe and service, so I'm givin' it 4!"}
{"input": "Good food but the quality doesn't seem to justify the prices.  Seems they should lower the price point by a dollar or two for the entrees... $16 for a bowl seems a bit steep."}
{"input": "For many years, RH&B was the place to go in south Jersey for great BBQ and blues. Sadly, after a recent sale, the restaurant has decided to cancel all live music. The food was decent at best, and in the absence of live music offerings  I can no longer recommend this restaurant. The only aspect I will miss are the people who worked there."}
{"input": "We had a gift card and came on a Tuesday night.  The food  was delicious.   My husband had a 12 oz rib eye.  He said it was the best he has had in years.  Alan was our server.  Excellent service.  AND they have cardboard take home boxes."}
{"input": "What a disappointment. Not what most expect with jazz bar/dining establishment. Not dark or comfy seating. I got a mojito and I do not think they could spare the mint. They had a sign about a cover charge at 8. They came over and said if we were still there at 8 eating we would be charged. The food was nothing special. It was about equal with Zattarans box foods. The shrimp they served in the jambalaya and gumbo could not be smaller. Service was lacking. They may want to look at improving the food and entertainment to fill their very empty establishment before they focus on a cover charge. To add the music was not worth the five and was not really jazz bar type. The bar was also cheaply done. If they do not change they will be gone in six months.  Hmmm trying to find a positive kids menu was decently priced."}
{"input": "This is my first choice whenever we decide to go out to dinner! They have a huge selection of foods that will fit any type of person who will be dining there. Their staff is super nice and will accommodate to whatever your needs may be! The restaurant itself is beautiful and very relaxing. In my opinion, Fellinis of media has the best Italian cuisine around."}
{"input": "Greeted at the door by a pleasant server.  Ample seating.  Tables turn over quickly.  Loud music. Hip vibe.   Young crowd.  Cheap eats.  $8 wines and a pretty decent beer selection.   Pizza served within 5 minutes!  Absolutely fabulous!  Nice thin crust with fresh ingredients.  Didn't expect fresh tasty basil in Philadelphia in 9° weather (bit of a basil snob, I am).  Good mozzarella on our Margherita pie.  Hubby had the special Salumente Picante pizza slice and it was tasty.  Nothing to scream home to mama about but a nice spot with a good slice.  Bravo."}
{"input": "Best Steakhouse on the beach and one of only 2 worth eating in all of Pinellas. Great food & great staff. \n\nThe ribeye is perfect.  If you like charred,  ask for Pittsburgh.  They know how to do it right.  Truffle fries,  bacon scallops and the chophouse potatoes must go with your meal. \n\nWe're weekly regulars.  Highly recommend."}

{"input": "Drove up and there was a long line wrapped around the outside... And I immediately thought... This is gonna be good.... And I was not let down at all!!!! I had the Reuben... Amazing, perfect! My son had the meatball sub, and he loved it! Husband had the muffuletta and it was nice and full. We will be back over and over again!!!"}
{"input": "Let me just say this. If this place was in the South, it would be okay at best. But this isn't. This is the Midwest of the Midwest. So I'm giving it a 4 star because these people have pushed it to the very point of being as Cajun/NOLA/Southern as they can with the demographic thats around. Anything more involving fried oysters, more crawfish, more fried anything, hard cajun spices, LSU and Saints decor, the locals wouldn't come. So I give them a thumps up for making it as close as Carmel-Indy will allow to stay in business.\n\nNow the food, its good. Not awesome, but I don't expect it to be. I had the pick three; Crawfish Casserole, Gumbo and Jambalaya. All fair sizes, all had a little kick. I would go again on my way through Carmel. More of a lunch place than dinner, but thats up to you.\n\nI hope they stay open and continue to grow.\n\nLaissez les bons temps rouler !"}
{"input": "If you are familiar with the soup nazi episode of Seinfeld, then you will know what to expect when you walk into Sam's.  He is Nashville's own Sushi Nazi.  And much like in Seinfeld the sushi is well worth any potential abuse.  \n\nYou never know exactly what to expect when you walk in, but make sure you follow the rules.   Write down your order, pass it to SAM, maybe even give a little bow.  At the very least you will get some pretty darn good sushi for the lowest price downtown.  If you are lucky you might come away with a good story to tell.  \n\nOne friend had Sam refuse to serve her sushi until she finished all of her miso soup.  Another friend was treated to a world politics lecture by Sam about the evils of American imperialism.  Go see for yourself and let the rest of us know what the Sushi Nazi does to you."}
{"input": "Great service, relaxing atmosphere and the food was exceptional. Sit outside at a high top, you'll quickly forget you in St.Louis."}
{"input": "Poor service. Went for lunch.  Server acted bored and could not care less.  Kitchen brought out my food as she never checked in it. Chicken was good but salad that came with lunch was full of water and premade. Server never refilled my drink and had to be tracked down. Twice. Tables were not full. Place was empty."}
{"input": "The restaurant looks nice. We order two sushi rolls and one tuna tartare.  tuna tartare was ok but the other rolls were really...bad .the taste are just not right! They gave a discount coupon for us but not sure we want to go back again"}
{"input": "My brother came to visit and we wanted to pick up a six pack of good beers for a night in. Ended up staying and having a few while playing their Nintendo 64 (Super Smash Brothers, which the owner said was donated by fellow patrons). It's a great place with good food and genuinely nice people. Should be a staple in the Northeast."}
{"input": "The salad was very good pizza was excellent!!! The 805 keg blow during my pour and they didn't have a replacement but they were very accommodating and gave me a Stella... Great customer service!!!"}
{"input": "We had a wonderful experience from the food right down to the friendly and prompt service. Jambalaya was done to perfection and the shrimp etouffe was perfectly cooked with an excellent sauce and rice. Seafood gumbo was fantastic with the right mix of seafood and okra, also perfectly cooked with a great texture. Shrimp in the etouffe dish was firm, clean, and very fresh tasting.\n\nBread pudding with praline sauce was a perfect complement to the meal, as was the Cafe du Monde coffee with the dessert. One of our top two dining experiences during our NOLA visit!"}
{"input": "We had dinner on a Tuesday night, and it was the best sushi we have had in a long time. The toro tasting platter was amazing- the fish literally melted in your mouth. We had the rainbow roll, jewelers roll, California roll and a sushi platter.  Everything was delicious!  The ratio of fish to rice was very high. Everything was also very customizable - we could get the mayo on the side and we asked for extra jalapeños and candied ginger. For dessert, the fried green tea ice cream and fried bananas were a perfect end to the meal.  The service was excellent; in particular, Tina the manager was extremely friendly and accommodating. We will definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"input": "Truly delicious and generously-sized burgers! The fries are superb-great pub food. The prices are a little steep. The service is fine. My go-to spot to dine and talk for hours and it's never been too busy where that would be an issue."}
{"input": "Pretty good.  Fresh food, pizza had a nice crust.  LOVED the salad with the grapes in 'em.  The only thing that was a little weird:  ALL of their pizzas sounded phenomenal...exactly the way i like, with neat ingredients put together thoughtfully, as opposed to a pile of cheese and meat on a crust.  We got the mushroom pizza and the green lantern.  They each had a nice array of toppings that sounded so scrumptious.  But when I bit into the pizzas, the flavors just didn't come through for some reason.  Maybe it's just me and the stupid medication I'm on (for acne, not the crazies), but the flavors just didn't gel for me...on those two pizzas...I will DEFINITELY go back and try the others.\n\nBottomline:  A great place for fresh food without the \"luxury\" tax."}
{"input": "Wedged between two meetings on the northside, I had an hour to kill and needed somewhere new to make my mini office. I wasn't in the mood to hit Starbucks for the second to this week, so I welcomed the alternative option found in B&N. \n\nWhat to expect:\n-Starbucks tucked in the corner with plenty of tables \n-all of the stationary, books and magazines you could hope for \n-an obnoxiously loud after school crowd\n-friend Starbucks staff handing out samples \n-a generous number of outlets making the space perfect for hours"}
{"input": "This salon is awful. I've seen bugs there in the past. But this particular visit, I went in for a spray tan... and as I am waiting I can hear the room next to me getting a spray- and it was obvious my machine was obsolete... they didn't even have the heater on in the room. And I was never offered the better option when I walked in. Just stuck with the crappy versaspa... the other person in the versapro was still getting sprays as I was leaving- leading me to believe I was taken for my money since I only got sprayed twice... I will be going to Shine from now on.. at least their rooms are consistent."}
{"input": "Being very generous with even two stars. It's a nice place to be to listen to entertainment and have a drink, however to eat.. is not acceptable. I was waiting over two hours to be seated and then when we were finally seated we were sitting down for over 30 minutes before we had to ask for a manager to even get us some drinks. Waited over an hour to even receive food, my salad was room temperature if not warm. My entree was pretty good, however the rest of my party's food wasn't even cooked properly. Drinks are strong which is great but i will never be returning here, ever."}
{"input": "I've tried their St. Louis cut Ribs, Smoked Chicken, and the Brisket. All are outstanding! Sweet Potato Fries and Cornbread are great! Going back for some Baby Backs and MacNCheese soon."}
{"input": "Paid for the $25 wash and detail (the most deluxe package they offer), added leather cleaning for $20. My dog had been in the car while muddy so there was dried dirt on the backseat, which I mentioned. I knew when they called me after only 15 min that it wasn't cleaned well. When I saw it it was obviously that they hadn't cleaned the leather at all. When I said that to the guy he sprayed a towel and literally wiped down the back seat for less than a minute. Didn't clean any other leather on the headrests, doors, console-anywhere. The wipe down on the cup holders, steering column, etc was just as bad. The vacuuming was terrible, didn't get under the mats or the way back. They didn't clean the rims at all even the the package included rim detail and shine. I basically paid $45 for a drive through car wash."}
{"input": "Myself and a group of ladies on a Bachelorette party stayed in this hotel. We got 2 rooms, both from Groupon. The location was pretty good, walking distance to bourbon st, canal st. And magazine st. One of our rooms was nicer than the second, so I would say I was a more disappointed in the second room it was very dated. Bathroom could have been cleaned better. What they advertise the rooms looking like is not even close to what they actually look like. The lobby was very nice, the service was pretty good. But the rooms could use updating considering what they are showing on the website. The cafe in the hotel was delicious great breakfast/brunch menu. Overall if your not looking for a really nice place to stay, it got the job done and wasn't super gross or cheap. I would stay there again but only if somewhere nicer for a comparable price wasn't available. Mainly I would stay again for the location."}
{"input": "I had the most disappointing and appalling experiencing ordering catering from this specific Chick-fil-A location. When I voiced my frustration with the Manager on Duty, I was made to feel like my problem was of no concern or care to her and her team and she was unwilling to de-escalate my frustrating situation. She was much more interested in being right than doing what she could to help me as the customer of a large order. I would NOT recommend ordering catering from this location unless you have the time and flexibility to take a chance on a tight schedule getting disrupted for the group you are feeding."}
{"input": "It is no longer Precision Kia. It is now owned by Fuccillo Kia. You hear all the radio and TV commercials. Let me say after being there for over 3 hours on a Sunday in the heat sucked. And to walk away without a car totally sucked. Totally disappointment."}
{"input": "Dons is good but not authentic.  If your looking more for drinks than food then this would be your place.  Its certainly an upbeat environment, well lit, decorated well.  Food is ok but again just not authentic."}
{"input": "outdoor pool not heated.  smelled cigarette smoke inside hotel, allows pets a negative for us, the eliptical exercise equipment was very strange, looked like it was with a bicycle.  couldn't figure it out.  will try a different hampton in Tucson next time.  been staying at this one for years, and it's gone downhill."}
{"input": "I've had better, but pretty good for a neighborhood sushi joint. I'll go back, sure. \n\nRoll menu fairly limited, but my guess is they'd accommodate most any request. Service was attentive and speedy. All staff was eager to please. Other reviewers are right: Service is thoughtful and attentive. \n\nI thought the rolls were all fine (Mariner, Rose #1, San Francisco), but nothing like \"aw damn!\" good. I really can't complain, except to be honest, I have had more memorable sushi. Still though, competent and perfectly acceptable. \n\nI never knew this was here, so I'm glad I found it. For a quick pop in for sushi near the house, this can't be beat."}
{"input": "I guess the ingredients weren't as fresh today since my boyfriend threw up twice upon eating chili beef nachos.  We had a to-go order - I got a chicken burrito.  It gave me some stomach cramps and other issues.  Just a heads up.\n\nHowever, we keep coming back since I love your shredded beef.  I thought I would change it up today."}
{"input": "There is real quality  there. The caveat, they use a lot of canola oil which no 1st  class bakery would. But on the other hand they will make with real butter and do if you call ahead and those products are very fine."}
{"input": "My pork sandwich was delicious. They have a buy 4 get the fifth sandwich free deal. The boba was just ok. The pho left something to be featured in the flavor department. Overall, this place fits the bill for affordable quick authentic grub on the go. The television inside displayed cock fights just to let you know. (Very authentic) The restaurant seemed tidy, and the staff goes out of their way to make patrons feel comfortable, despite the obvious language barrier. I live their bahn mi, some day I'll have to come back!"}
{"input": "Best breakfast place in Indy hands down. Have had consistent great service and consistently great food. I always bring my out of town friends here and everyone loves it. Yes there can be a wait but it's worth it. Love that it's in an old house with creaks in the floor and all. One of the owners (I think I've only met one of the owners) is the sweetest and happiest woman."}
{"input": "I used the mobile app, the bill was for $31  and I asked a friend to pick  it up.\nThe store refused to give her the order because I was not there with my Card. I'd done this at least 6 times before without issue.  So I understand that TBELL is trying to watch out for my money.  not letting anyone steal using my account   So why then did they still charge me the $31 even though I never received the food.  \n\nWho is it I'm being protected from  hackers or Taco Bell itself.  I'm out $31\n\nI've attempted to contact TBELL but I'm not able to get through to them."}
{"input": "This is the worst restaurant that I have ever been to. Service is poor. Food is soso. We have to go to another restaurant afterwards to get some real food. I will never come again. I would not recommend it to any of my friends."}
{"input": "At the midpoint of a bike ride, we had the chicken gyros and falafel sandwich for lunch, and they were wonderful. Ingredients are fresh and flavorful, and the staff, overseen by the effusive Smiley, were consistently friendly and helpful."}
{"input": "This place was awesome. It's expensive, but pretty cool views of the arch. The only reason it's not a 5 star review is because you have to wait in line for a while for the elevator, but not a big deal. Would definitely recommend."}
{"input": "Rita Johnson- Exit Booth Agent extraordinaire! \n\nNational, always fast in and fast, easy out. \nThe icing on the cake, Rita being efficient and professional, then closing with passing you back your license and credit card with a chilled bottle of water and a Philadelphia pretzel."}
{"input": "Great service and phenomenal dessert. The gooey butter cake was delicious. The outdoor patio is pet friendly. Good vibes and good food!"}
{"input": "Great food the burgers were fresh and charcoal flavored. The boardwalk fries best I've had south of Ocean City Maryland!  Great service fun music 8 HDTVs per side of bar to watch NFL. I will be back!"}
{"input": "Went there for lunch and was pleasantly surprised, as having recently moved to Tampa from Los Angeles, I have been disappointed by the food.  However, I give Ploy Thai 4 stars, not just by Tampa standards, but by good food standards.  The food was very flavorful and the ingredients very fresh."}
{"input": "Sometimes I just head on over to Kingsway if I need a little shopping fix, instead of battling the crowds at West Ed. They've got lululemon, Jacob, Danier, Gap, Club Monaco, American Eagle, and a variety of other shops that work for me, and it's never so busy you have to brush past people in the halls. \n\nI sometimes just go for the food -they've got New York Fries, Orange Julius, Poppin' pop corn, Booster Juice, Extreme Pita, Bad Ass Jack's and other choices. \n\nThe food court has a ton of seating. It's never completely full. There's a Zellers and a dollar store and a Sears. I just wish they had a Bay and a movie theatre to round it out a bit. Otherwise, Kingsway is as good a mall as I need."}
{"input": "Melissa is by far the BEST! I've gone to two other lash lounges and I will tell you Melissa outdoes them all. She knows her craft. She doesn't double or triple stack lashes. She gets you in and out. 100% recommend going to Melissa."}
{"input": "I concur with all the other 5 star reviews!  I'm always skeptical as to reviews really be honest these days, especially in this case since mostly all of them are 5 stars; but it's ALL true!!  This boutique is very nice and clean, and Lori did an excellent job with the waxing and making me feel comfortable.  This was my first time getting the blue hard wax, and I'm sold!  I don't ever need to go back to the regular wax again!  Another plus is the option of a \"custom wax\".  I left there very pleased, and already made my appt. to go back!\n\nSoooo grateful to Yelp reviewers in helping me find this spot!"}
{"input": "The food was good, prices good and the server was really sweet. Will definitely go again. It's small inside so you feel very cozy with your neighbors. Hope to get seats at the bar next time."}
{"input": "Absolutely charming breakfast, brunch, and dinner spot. Happened it while in Philly for a conference and actually considered extending my stay just to explore their menu fully.  Food is elegant but has a warm, home cooked feel, coffee is strong, and the ambiance is great.  Gotta love a spot whose servers shout \"Opa\" when a guest breaks a glass!"}
{"input": "My partner and I split the vegetarian platter and left stuffed! Delicious food, very kind and attentive staff.  Will help you make decisions on ordering and certainly won't take advantage of you. Will definitely be back."}
{"input": "Absolutely awful pizza.  My fiancee and I ate there last night and ordered takeout.  First of I got to there to pick up my order and was ignored for about 15 minutes when I finally had to get somebody to get my order.  Once I got the pizza it was burned and black on the outside of the pizza and on the bottom.  I was able to eat about one piece of pizza because of how badly burned it was.  The pizza was barely chewable because of this.  Then last night both my fiancee and I felt sick after eating the pizza.  So save yourself and your stomach the agony and head to one of the far better pizza places in Indianapolis.  Absolutely awful and would never eat here again.  Unfortunately I cant give zero stars."}
{"input": "Eh, don't believe the hype on this place, its obvious most of these people have not been to DC and had real Ethiopian. I was let down by the food personally due to lack of flavor, however the service was decent. I only ate about half the meal before I gave up and asked for the check."}
{"input": "Was hesitant to return after my last check in but drinks were dope again as of several days ago."}
{"input": "Amazing fresh pressed juice and breakfast food. We make it a point to come here every time we are in NOLA."}
{"input": "The apartments are ok but staff is worst when you left apartment for any reason. They charged me $500 for carpet replace even if carpet was in good condition. I will NOT recommend this apartment to my friends."}
{"input": "First time having a St. Paul and it was DELICIOUS! Do not try to pick at it, it won't taste like anything but a mouthful of grease. But take a bite of the entire sandwich and it's so yummy! I got the shrimp one and will be back for another one on my next visit to the Lou!"}
{"input": "A good place to order from when its late and you have the muchies... for whatever reason ;-)"}
{"input": "We stayed at peddlers village for a wedding.  Decided we liked the looks of Earl's. We went in just as lunch was ending, but before dinner. We were told we could make a reservation for 30 minutes later and come back.  A little strange we thought. The woman at the desk seems to think she is the gate keeper. Much like the soup Nazi. Lol. We returned as instructed and waited with six other groups for the clock to read precisely 5pm.  At 5pm she asked who had reservations (even with the restaurant empty) and sat us all in order of reservations then non reservations...she made a very loud general announcement to this effect. We all chuckled amongst ourselves. Oh and the food was \"good\"."}
{"input": "I've only been to their casino and I love that its only an hour away from Orlando yet it feels so far. The atmosphere is typical of most casinos with the exception of over priced burgers and fries at the Hard Rock Cafe. \n\nI had some luck on the Breakfast at Tiffany's slot machine and as a lover of the movie, it was a fun one to play."}
{"input": "Everyone @ this salon was friendly, professional and helpful.\n\nI made an appointment with Shaun and I am very glad I did.  I found a few pictures of the hair style that I wanted.  Shaun took his time, patiently explaining that my hair could look the way I want it, but needed to grow out to achieve this style.  He shaped my hair, evened out the last cut, so now my hair looks great.  He didn't cut too much and I am confident that my hair will look good while I grow it out.\n\nThank you, Shaun"}
{"input": "Hammy isn't too sure about this place--lots of dark lights and loud music. I tripped and fell. Also, the bartender made my whiskey and coke with vodka and soda. Something's amiss with the restrooms as well. Talk to you soon. Hammy rules!!!"}
{"input": "And for my third visit... I ordered a dirty chai latte, which took almost 10 minutes to create (despite being the only customer in there), and it was topped with fresh grated nutmeg, which gave it an astringent flavor which was so hard to choke down that I threw the cup away, barely a third of the way down. Big waste of money. \n\nNote: I've had a dirty chai here once before, without the nutmeg and with a different barista creating it, and it was truly one of the best I'd had.  The short of it? Make sure they don't put nutmeg on it, because it does NOT taste as good."}
{"input": "Step out of your comfort zone and try this restaurant,  you won't be disappointed.  I drive by this location often while on the road for work and decided to make a go for it today.  I was dining alone so it can be a little uncomfortable walking into the unknown.  The staff was very friendly,  answered all of my questions and had my food ready quickly. I was greeted with a nice warm basket of pita and pickles (pickled veggies).  I ordered Foule from the appetizer menu which consists of whole chick peas, spices, lemon juice and some of the best olive oil I have ever had the pleasure of tasting.  It was so rich in flavor and color. I enjoyed it with the warm pita.  Next was my chicken kabob \"sandwich\" which was nice hearty chunks of grilled chicken, green and red peppers rolled into another large pita. It's alot of food so more than likely you will be asking for a to go box. The atmosphere was nice and clean and I can not wait to try more menu items."}
{"input": "Great Food & Service !! I had the pancakes and Bacon. My wife had the BLT which was prepared with lots of bacon. Very clean location in a good area. All the staff are very friendly. Wait time for food was very short !!"}
{"input": "I've been coming to Blue Sage for years and just now getting around to a review. This place is great for anyone, non vegetarians love this place too! Anything I have ever ordered here is delicious and the service is always wonderful. Glad they got a bigger space so more people can enjoy it here. Don't be afraid to be adventurous, and don't be intimidated by the menu, I promise everything here is delicious! It's also a great idea to order a few different things and share them to try things out. My personal favorites are the blue corn asparagus tacos and the roasted fingerling salad oh and the Buddha and their desserts are wonderful too. I love that it's a BYOB. I could go on and on, but you should try it for yourself."}
{"input": "What they did with this building is inspiring. Not to mention the unique food selection and also the regular bar favorites. Always great service, love The Depot!"}
{"input": "I did have a bad review for this restaurant, but now that the manager has made contact with me and cleared up the issue, I decided to change my review. Not only is the food amazing, but the service is extremely friendly and cares about your food. Five stars from me."}
{"input": "Pedicure here was excellent, no problem with the services offered. However, I walked in on a different day for a fill and the staff basically ignored me. \nThe guy actually seemed annoyed that I was there, told me to wait and then never got back to me. I sat there for at least 10 minutes without a word.  I left and won't be going back. I can get a good pedicure somewhere else with someone who actually values my business."}
{"input": "Had dinner Saturday night for the first time at rusty pelican. Called ahead and made a reservation and requested a table next to the window overlooking the water. Hostess went to seat us away from the window, when we questioned her she huffed off and left us staying in the middle of the dining room!! She did return and sat us by the window. The rest of the evening was great, drinks, food and wait staff was excellent. Liz was our server and went above and beyond. Still have to say the hostess was very disappointing!"}
{"input": "Not worth the 50% off. I knew I had a bad feeling the second I walked in. The restaurant was a bit too hot for a sushi bar with fish sitting there behind the un-refrigerated glass all day. I should have listened to my gut but I made a huge mistake. I ended up getting so sick! Some of the worst sushi I have ever had, horrible service, and less than 1 star quality food."}
{"input": "My favorite place for Mexican food in Indianapolis! Their meat is full of flavor, their portions are more than enough! It's definitely a carry out place, but it's well worth the wait. Love it here!"}
{"input": "We struck gold and found this  5 star gem on Yelp. Fabulous ambiance, 1/2 block from the beach, and to our great pleasure- quiet. Our room was a like a charming beach bungalow, with a fireplace, great lighting, mini kitchen, high end bed /bedding, and pillows that didn't make me miss  mine at home. Customer service was off the charts. No beach view, but jacuzzi right outside the door. We could have had continental breakfast there, but walked around the block to Sambo's for their fabulous waffles."}
{"input": "Ambience-very comfortable, day or night. Just a lovely delicious cup of coffee served in a   cup and saucer- lovely. It's so much more enjoyable this way. And the \"regular\" size is quite generous.  Don't come here if you'd prefer to pay a fortune for a coffee drink with a name you can't pronounce, and then sit at a table to drink it from a paper cup. This place makes you feel welcome to sit and take your time at a table looking out through the large glass front, at the crepe myrtle tree lined sidewalk and little globe lights on the front patio.  It's simply my favorite place in New Orleans to get my coffee zen on. (Oh, and they do great breakfast and lunch panini)"}
{"input": "You can't beat the prices for the unlimited food, but I've had better. The sushi is delicious, the salad was subpar and the crab Rangoon was probably the worst I've had. I've been twice and would definitely go again."}
{"input": "Definitely a cool coffee spot for purists. Great atmosphere. I also liked how the servers were stlyishly attired. The place is very comfy and also sells converse shoes, gourmet soaps and candles, and has other interesting items to look at. It's nice to see Ybor getting cool at this end of town with this place, Ybor Daily Market, the taxidermy art place, etc. :)"}
{"input": "Great atmosphere, great cut and shave, great overall experience. Love the online scheduling. I've had great haircuts before, but what sets The Handsomizer apart for me was Steve's very personable and professional demeanor. He didn't just sit me down and work through the appointment. He went the extra mile to make me feel welcome and relaxed. He seems to really lock in with the concept of the importance of atmosphere. The full Handsomization experience was well worth the cost."}
{"input": "i found this by accident  was hungry at work and tried this place on uber eats and i was impressed food was good the salmon was on point seasoned just rite mac and cheese was on point well worth the 5 stars this is a must try"}
{"input": "Been coming here with my brother for 10 years and will continue to come here for many more I hope. Get a players card, it's free, and they don't care how much money you play with just how long you play. If you have a card you will get amazing comps like free rooms and dining discounts. After their 500 million dollar expansion they really are the best hotel in Reno and it's a nice distance from downtown where now it's become ghetto. Great staff, service, food, drinks, and entertainment. 5 stars all the way!"}
{"input": "The Bricks is a tasty restaurant for lunch with a cool and unique Ybor City atmosphere along with friendly service! The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it is a little pricey for the quantities."}
{"input": "Dayum, that was a good burger. Juicy, glistening melting with cheese - simplistic yet tastes completely different from other burger joints due the quality of the ingredients. Bacon looks good in pictures, but it was a too thick of slice of puuuure white fat, if it would have melted in my mouth it would have worked but it didn't therefore just felt sinful, in a bad way. \n\nUnfortunately, this communal table trend has got to go. \nI hate it, it's a crap shoot on who your going to get to sit next to and basically listen to a complete strangers stupid conversations. Terrible idea."}
{"input": "Service and food was absolutely HORRIBLE. Waited in the drive thru for a half hour before I could even roll up to have my order taken because the staff was serving out food so slow. Then once I finally got to where you place your order, I had to wait for 5 more minutes before anyone took my order. Then I had to repeat myself 3 times before they could hear my order and they didn't apologize for the wait or at least explain the situation. Then once I finally got the the window nobody even apologized for making us all wait for horribly long time. Once I finally got my food and it was cold as could be, the meat on my burger was dry, and had NO toppings on it and the buns were dry and hard. Worst service I have EVER HAD. Staff was rude and food was horrible, cold and dry"}
{"input": "Came for Valentine's Day! Received amazing service from our waitress she gave amazing suggestions. I ordered a pork chop and it was delicious. The flemmings potatoes have become my favorite side and the Thai green beans were great as well. Great environment welcoming staff and i will surely be coming back for more!"}
{"input": "Had a great meal. Sat in the bar. About half way through the meal, someone in the kitchen turned on VERY LOUD RAP MUSIC.  Sorry , but it was extremely irritating hearing loud rap music and the music in the restaurant. REALLY? Do you have to have this music while cooking. Your not at home. You are at a business. I was it the Greenwood/ county line store"}
{"input": "Pikpon is a small, clean and spicy little shop you could easily miss because the sign is too small. Thankfully, Yelp finds even the most hidden gems. \n\nI ordered the Spicy Basil Fried Rice (peppers, onion, string beans, chili & egg) with chicken, which is enough for 2 people. The dish is medium spicy, but plenty hot for the average palate. Chicken was plentiful in the take out dish.  \n\nI will definitely return for the Lobster or Pad Thai, or one of the many Thai drinks on the menu."}
{"input": "Had high hopes for this place, but was very disappointed. We opted for beer tastings and were surprised at the poor quality of the offerings and that none of them were from anywhere near this area (they serve Figueroa Mountain but not in our tastings). I like sampling beers from farther afield, but I'd expect them to represent more of a \"best of.\"\n\nI did the tasting that included IPAs--one of them was about the worst I've tasted and the other not much better. Also, it didn't seem to make a lot of sense to offer a tasting that combined IPAs with several particularly insipid brews.\n\nService was particularly unenthusiastic."}
{"input": "My daughter and I stopped in for lunch a couple of weeks ago - no frills breakfast and lunch place.  Seated promptly, order taken by a very nice waitress.\n\nThey rearranged the entry for (presumably) more seating.  We had a seat very close to the door and it was rather cold - not the end of the world.  Ordered the spinach melt with fries, daughter went with a cheeseburger and fries.\n\nMelt was very good - larger in size, served on nice bread with tomato.  Fries were hot and fresh and what I would describe as \"Shoestring boardwalk style\".  Not a fan.  Too little potato and too much grease.  Sort of like the basket filler you get at a Long John Silver's.  Daughter liked them though - she had half of mine.\n\nNoticed that the Roost was listed as a place to visit (!) from a customer who was in town on business.  Not sure what it says about Fishers in general, but he went there for breakfast on our recommendation and really enjoyed as well.\n\nGood local place - suitable for breakfast and lunch.  Come as you are."}
{"input": "I had the banana foster french toast. To die for.\nHusband ordered Migos-something (scrambled eggs with chorizo) equally delicious! \nAlthough there was a line when we arrived, our total wait time was less than 10 mins. Janet the hostess was friendly and hustled to get tables sat. I immediately became obsessed with the trendy decor and layout of what used to be a classic front porch- turned restaurant."}
{"input": "I will keep this short and sweet. \n\nSassafras has a very great selection of creole and soul food. It is located near the Lakefront in New Orleans. I am a little concerned that there are no reviews. This place has outstanding food. This is one of few Soulfood restaurants in the Gentilly area. \n\nHere's a quick rundown:\n\nThe baked and fried chicken are wonderful!\nYams are awesome! \nThe grilled shrimp salad is delicious!\nMac & cheese uhmm so so\nGumbo is not very exciting! \nSunday Brunch is wonderful... Creole Omelets\n\nDaily specials are available. Check them out even if you are not in the neighborhood..."}
{"input": "GREAT staff, helped us store our bicycles inside for safety and super friendly. Easy location to get back on Route 70. Breakfast okay. \nThe room, however, was scary. Black mold in shower, cracked sink, filthy carpet, dark brown paneling like a 1980s executive room gone baaaad. The only good news: no bedbugs... but we were worried. We came in late and exhausted so we didn't ask for a change"}
{"input": "This isn't Chinatown, but for your local Chinese food fix China Wok is just fine.\nFast delivery and courteous service.\nThe food is better than average at a good price.\nThey don't do fancy food, for that there's other places in the area, but if your a pork fried rice, egg roll, Spare rib etc. type of person this place is fine. 5 stars for the fast delivery."}
{"input": "Love the venue.\n\nHave not had a good experience with the food. \n\nAt our table of 6: The grilled cheese was so badly  burnt..practically inedible. The burgers that were suppose to be medium were well done. The Kitchen Sink salad was completely drenched in dressing and the chicken on top seemed canned or frozen. The Macken Cheese tasted like something was rotten in it....rancid? Overall everyone at the table was not impressed. \n\nMixed drinks were poured pretty weak as well. \n\nWe will come again for the shows but maybe just stick to an order of fries and beer in the future."}
{"input": "We had Shrimp Scampi, fried shrimp, stuffed mushrooms, cheese sticks, chicken fingers and biscuits.  The mushrooms were great!  Everything else was very good we enjoyed it."}
{"input": "We probably got nearly 90+ number 1's for $185! A lot more than the place in Del city for the money. I'll never go anywhere else! My friends in N.Y. go nuts over these live blues."}
{"input": "Looking at all good reviews i ordered baja fish taco.. Was bland but liked the shrimp tacos :)"}
{"input": "Loved this place! Visiting from out of town, and met up with three girlfriends. \n\nMargaritas were fabulous, loved the fire and ice and standard margarita. \n\nThe food was superb. We each had different entrees and shared a couple appetizers, everything was flavorful and generous portions. We each went home with leftovers. \n\nThe atmosphere and decor was perfectly done. The outside curb appeal is not quite as nice and parking is tough, but the inside is done very well. \n\nWould definitely recommend and hope to be back on a visit. Their sister restaurant, Northside Social, could learn a thing or two from Delicia. NS was just awful."}
{"input": "FABULOUS!!! Picture it New Year's morning 2 a.m. walking down Bourbon Street in thigh high boots & needing FOOD! My boyfriend was appalled that after all my times in NOLA, I had never had a chili dog from the Lucky Dog cart on the street!  \n\nI have to say it hit the spot! The toppings were great, the hot dog yummy, but it was the BUN!!! The bun was almost buttery nearly melting in my mouth and has the perfect temperature all WARM!!! Will definitely add to my must eats in NOLA!"}
{"input": "The food was ok and the service wasn't bad.  Get the Monster Margarita if you do go and the tequila will take away the bad smell of the place!!"}
{"input": "Dr. Steele is wonderful.  She is extremely easy to get in touch with and is very knowledgeable about the services and products she offers.  Fantastic, flexible hours which is great for someone who works a lot and her prices are unbeatable.  I was thrilled to find a doctor who offers effective laser hair removal at a reasonable price.  She also really spends time with you and it is clear she values her client base.  Great atmosphere/waiting room complete with massage chairs.  Also a note that she uses the ND:Yag which works on all skin types.  I saw results even after just one treatment."}
{"input": "Aldi is a great grocery store because of the fabulously low prices.  The store here at 52nd and keystone has also started carrying organic vegetables, orange juice and some canned options like spaghetti sauce.  Bring a quarter so you can access a shopping cart and your own bags.  They sell bags, but we all know it just makes environmental sense to reuse.  Look for these favorites of mine;  organic nacho chips, fresh cilantro, organic salad greens, fresh salsa, ready to bake pizza's for $5 (not frozen), special items in the cheese case and some pretty good coffee for $4.  The lines look long, but they really move pretty fast and if they get too long, another cashier will come up and help."}
{"input": "So we walked in and a 45min wait, yeah that's not happening but there was open seating in the bar, which we took. We were told 45min for the pie as it takes that long to cook, which is standard for Chicago style. We ordered the ravioli app and beers and were impressed from there. Watching the guys and gals through the window throwing the dough and seeing the process was eat-tainment. The pie came and for 4 grown men, we couldn't put down a large it was too much.  100% we will be back."}
{"input": "Beef Noodles Soup is the best here ...they make their own noodles here plus no MSG...fried Dumplings are very good ...their hot sauce homemade is so good"}
{"input": "Excellent meal! We shared a very nice size portion Mediterranean Salad which they split into two plates. My better half enjoyed the white shrimp scampi and I ordered the Black Bass With risotto and fresh veggies. The fish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. Their homemade desserts were extremely appealing. We decided on the coconut cream cake and lemon sorbet- both excellent!!"}
{"input": "Ohana means family, and as soon as you enter this restaurant and meet the owner teresa you will truly feel like you are just that. The food is delicious and healthy, from the meat options to vegan, you will not be disappointed with anything on the menu."}
{"input": "The first thing one notices upon entering this place is that it smells wonderful. Like all Ben & Jerry's, the ice cream is delicious and there tons of flavors & toppings from which to choose. The staff is generally fast & courteous, if a bit hipsterish. \n\nI've never had any complaints about my experiences here, but there's also never been anything so terrific as to merit five stars."}
{"input": "Sally is great! She really takes her time and I can tell she genuinely cares to give a quality cut. Been to countless barbershops that charge a ridiculous amount for a \"supercuts\" haircut but at players you'll walk out with a quality cut for a reasonable price."}
{"input": "It's okay. If you do not have a car and need some photos after a crazy night I guess this would be the best spot available in Isla Vista.  The broth needs depth, there is some flavor, but you need to add tons of spices and other sauces to make it worth while."}
{"input": "Meh...I wasn't impressed with this spot. Looking past the array of hand written signs and lack of available bagels, the food was ok. I got the pastrami, egg, and cheese. There was hardly any pastrami and the cheese wasn't melted. My wife also had the pleasure of adding spoiled creamer to her coffee. I think we'll just stick with Einstein's or St Pete Bagel."}
{"input": "I'm at the hotel now. Finally got up to my room after they refused to let me check in 20 min early (but I saw them letting others check in). Let's not forget to mention I paid $400+ for one night here. The room is absolutely disgusting. There are stains everywhere. There is a loud ringing noise that I can't figure out what it is or where it's coming from. I'm absolutely disgusting by this place."}
{"input": "This is probably my newest favorite Thai place to eat in the downtown area. I'd swing by for lunch sometimes for their lunch specials. It's such a great deal. For around 8-9 dollars, you get a salad (I recommend the Erawan salad, which is essentially a salad with their peanut dressing), an appetizer/soup (the chicken coconut soup is my favorite), and an entree. The owner and chef are from the southern part of Thailand and they're more known for their curries in the south, so sticking with their curry entrees would be a safe bet. I've had only the chicken massaman curry and it is great! I'll have to try out their other curries on my next visits. But yeah, all of that for 8 bucks + tax/tip... how can you beat that?!"}
{"input": "Great prices & selection, but what a zoo. Lots of rude customers can make a bad shopping experience. Customer service is almost always top notch."}
{"input": "Get take-out from here about once a month or so but randomly like to dine-in. Very friendly & food is wonderful. Love their pizza, wings, & lasagna. Prices are great."}
{"input": "This is such a great coffee shop and a great addition to east kensington.   I love the music they play here and the vibe is so friendly and inviting."}
{"input": "If you have to go to this place, don't get fish, they are not fresh. Average 20$ order takes about 10 to 15 min. \nFood 1/5\nPrice 4/5\nService 4/5"}
{"input": "Extremely rude staff (including management). I had ordered carry out only to return home with the wrong order. My family has dietary restrictions so we could not eat what we had brought home. So I went back to pick up the correct order. When I got there, I told the manager at the front that we had the wrong order. They said they had my order and knew it was wrong. So I asked why they didn't feel the need to notify my or anything that we had the wrong order. The manager began to blame the employees. No apology, nothing. Don't let the renovations fool you. There was no sense of professionalism or quality customer service. I will not be returning to this location."}
{"input": "The waitress said the country potatoes come with bell peppers and onions. They don't. The huevos rancheros mention avocado on the menu,  however,  my plate only came with a very small slice;  maybe an eighth of an entire avocado. They accidentally brought beans when I asked for country potatoes to be subbed. They quickly fixed it. The customer service is attentive and friendly,  except for the waitress not knowing the country potatoes ingredients. Very small portion for $8 on huevos rancheros."}
{"input": "Best food and margaritas I've had in Tampa area since moving to Hudson 2.5 years ago. The mushroom quesadilla is fantastic. The guacamole is to die for. My hubby try's something new each time we we here and is never disappointed!!!"}
{"input": "Mr. X has amazing flavor and overall a pretty friendly staff. The wait time for carry out is on average about 20 minutes, which is way better than a 45 minute wait at chain pizzerias. I get the hand-tossed crust comparable to traditional NY style pizza, and has excellent flavor and texture!"}
{"input": "The Aloft Downtown Tampa is a great hotel in a perfect location right on the Riverwalk in the downtown area. I would recommend this spot for travelers of all types. Tampa is really growing into a neat city, and this hotel is right near a lot of the cultural action in the area. The staff is attentive and very helpful. The pool deck area is great for relaxing or swimming for the kids, and the bar area is a trendy spot for a happy hour drink and appetizer. The hotel is minimal, clean, and has a great vibe. Overall, I had a wonderful stay, and I recommend this hotel for any Tampa visit."}
{"input": "It pains me to write this, but I fear I must...\n\nI used to really enjoy P&K as a lively neighborhood spot with elevated pub food. But yesterday in the early evening, the place was overrun with drunken frat boys dropping f-bombs at top volume and shouting about their exploits as rapists. After multiple parties complained, asked to be moved, or left altogether, what did the management do? NOTHING! Just kept serving them more beer.\n\nIt's hard to justify $25-$30 dishes when the atmosphere is that of no-class dive bar. And skip the octopus. It's overcooked and rubbery.\n\nTo be fair, the oysters were excellent; hence the second star."}
{"input": "I truly enjoyed the atmosphere, the service (Connor) and my dinner meal. I had the cakes for an appetizer, a cup of barley soup and the shrimp ravioli. Malbec glass of wine was perfect. First time here. Thrilled to know they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner!  Highly recommend. I will most certainly be back."}
{"input": "Its worth a go.  Although its not huge-trust me your kids will have fun.  \nRemember to Bring your own towels and I suggest you bring water shoes too.\nVery Cute-with a retractable roof-which is perfect for the winter time.  \nPlace is kept well enough.  \nThere is a baby/small toddler area with their own slide and water sprinklers."}
{"input": "THE BEST TACOS!! good wings and great gyros..this place ROCKS.."}
{"input": "Only giving a 1 because there is nothing lower!!! Angie\nGave me the worst haircut I've ever had!!! I came in with 2 photos of the cut I wanted came out with my hair looking NOTHING like the photos!!  Even when pointed out to her she didn't not pay attention to what she was doing.  Came out basically having a mans flattop!  Would never go to this place again!!! Nothing like going into the Holidays with a crappie haircut. Thank you!! Angie and Regis Hair salon!!"}
{"input": "This is my favorite place to enjoy gelato in St. Louis. \n\nConsider the... \n\nCoffee house-like atmosphere. \nLarge outdoor patio with a fountain and surrounding foliage. \nDelicious gelato and baked goods. \n\nYes, everything at Gelateria is pleasing."}
{"input": "Wow. We visited NOLA last week and took the truly awesome and informative  Steamboat Natchez trip on March 30. Can't tell you how interesting it was and pleasant. Plus these people are so well-organized and nice. JoJo reserved us a window seat - just could not believe the kind and excellent service. \nVery very nice.  Recommend!!!!"}
{"input": "Great little family joint.  Shrimp, oyster and crawfish all delicious"}
{"input": "Step up from the Cheesecake Factory...I enjoy the happy hour menu. Atmosphere is nice and food is good. Our waiter was a little clueless one night but the manager made up for everything and that's the one of the reason that I continue to give them my business."}
{"input": "Last couple of visits food has been average at best. Food served on bare metal tray and luke warm. Mac and cheese tasty but cold. Sweet tea so sweet it leaves an after taste in your mouth. Pretty bummed as this was one of my favorite bbq places when visiting last school year."}
{"input": "Called in to get service information on my 2015 $110K AMG. Was told since I didn't purchase the vehicle at their dealership that I would have to pay for a loaner car for warranty work. Will be staying far away from here."}
{"input": "I'm very picky when it comes to Sushi. Quality of the fish and ingredients are very important but so is the chef, maybe the most important. Hiro San is absolutely amazing at what he does. His skills are hands down the best and he's also a really great human being to talk to. If you are in the Santa Barbara area looking for a great Sushi experience come here and sit in front of the master, you won't regret it."}
{"input": "Very helpful staff and a ton of awesome shoes!! So much stuff that is hard to find. Dope spot!"}
{"input": "I LOVE the Fountain!! This is my favorite restaurant in St Louis! All of their food is delicious and interesting. Not your ordinary sandwiches and salads. Obviously the ice cream and ice cream martinis are great but I am partial to the Hemingway which is absinthe and champagne!"}
{"input": "If you love pizza Brooklyn pizza & cafe is where too go! I eat here regularly and it's always great. The staff is really nice. The pizza is always made fresh when I order it and it's ready in less than 10/15 minutes when I order it to go."}
{"input": "The pasta was cooked perfectly, chicken parm was delicious and pizza was good. What amazes me most is in a packed place this one cashier/waitress was able to do it all seamless and well. Impressed"}
{"input": "Howard's the man for all things VW.  It can take a few weeks to make an appointment, but he's thorough, reliable, knowledgeable and efficient."}
{"input": "Hands down, my favorite restaurant in Philly. And I love MANY restaurants in Philly. It's as if some lovely Greek-Cypriot family invited me to their home for a lovely Greek-Cypriot dinner, provided I bring my own wine and pay them about $40. I'd accept that invitation any day. \n\nKanella simply offers classic, rustic dishes made with fresh, often organic ingredients by a chef who obviously cares a lot about his food. You'll see him buzzing around the dining room, advising diners on how best to enjoy the dishes before them. Might come off as heavy-handed, but this guy knows exactly what he's doing. \n\nBiggest hits for me include the whole fish (or any filet on the menu), duck breast and pork loin. For dessert, it's always the galaktobureko. Heaven. \n\nBrunch is fantastic, too, and an even more affordable way to enjoy Kanella. Plus, the service is always spot-on, no matter how full the restaurant is."}
{"input": "Fantastic restaurant concept. Good cheap food fast. Fresh, better than average ingredients. Indie background music. No complaints. \nThis type of pizza is better when consumed immediately. Take out degrades rapidly."}
{"input": "This was a fun place with friendly and fun bartenders.  The food was pretty good too."}
{"input": "We would have loved to try this restaurant but unfortunately we were told they had stopped serving food when we got there (we got there shortly before 10pm). The Eldorado website clearly stated that they served lunch and dinner until close. I was very unimpressed. We did not even have a chance to try their beer as we had been driving for 5 hours and needed food first."}
{"input": "This location is by far the best of all the Café Du Monde I've tried during my visit in NOLA. The beignets are consistently not oily and freshly cooked whenever we came here. (Been in this location 3 times in 6 days back in Dec 2017) what's more, there ice mocha and cafe mocha are also really good it's not too sweet and works well with the beignets. Wish they would open a location in SoCal."}
{"input": "Not a bad place for a sandwich or salad.  Focus on fresh and healthy food.  Flatbreads made in store."}
{"input": "Pleasantly surprised to find Taiwanese restaurant in Reno. Convenient to all of the hotels.  Solid boba tea and authentic Taiwanese food if you know what to order"}
{"input": "I could never go to another dentist! I had a traumatic experience with a dentist when I was younger and have always had bad anxiety when it comes to dental work. Dr. Dayley is not only personable and helps calm my nerves but is very good at what he does! I've had all four wisdom teeth removed by him, and trust him with my teeth. He is the best dentist I've ever been to! I highly recommend him to everyone I know. My entire family including my parents and younger siblings all go to him as well. The front desk and staff are very welcoming and sweet. Thank you for being the best dentist office!"}
{"input": "This place is amazing.  The area is gorgeous and awesome decor.  We usually just buy a tri-tip sandwich outside but today we sat indoors and we were not disappointed.  The onion rings are bomb, the wild game chili and The charbroiled venison steak sandwich was awesome.  This place is well worth the drive and the wait."}
{"input": "Excellent customer service. I went in there earlier this afternoon to ask what I thought was a silly question, and the gentleman happily answered my question and got my issue resolved pronto. Such an easy-going experience for these sorts of tasks are refreshing for me, so I'll definitely be going back."}
{"input": "Can't get enough of their taco Tuesday waitresses are very friendly, service is prompt and price is right I definitely recommend going on Tuesday."}
{"input": "We went there on a Monday since we had a coupon and didn't want to be \"those\" people and go on a weekend. Service was beyond excellent. Salad bar was fantastic and the meats are awesome. Get the lamb shank...oooo man, that's TASTY. Just make sure to be hungry because there is nothing \"small\" going on in that place.\n\nWe ride the short bus apparently and the coupon we had was for the place down the street. They were so cool about it that the still gave us 25% off the bill, how awesome is that. We'll be back for sure."}
{"input": "The food was very gross and the service was just as bad. Please do not eat there but the beer was good."}
{"input": "Ok. I have had Persian food before as it is one of my favorite. So I was little disappointed with the food. \nI had Chicken Koobideh. I had little chicken in it's taste and a lot of eggish taste.\nKoobideh is more like Keema chicken from my experience, with nice mix of onions, chilly, and seasoning. \nSo, on part of taste I rate it.\n\nApart that, uber interior, good service upper class experience. \nFood portion is generous and good enough for 2 for one order.\n\nOver all ok ok. I would liked if they had served hummus and pita bread in their welcome. Also server salad as their sides. Middle eastern food is said to have perfect-balance of carbs, protein and fiber but it was found missing to call it a Middle Eastern fine dinner."}
{"input": "The Disc Golf course here is one of the nicest you will ever see. Professional satellite view type tee signs, benches, and bag posts at every hole. Multiple pin locations ensure your round will likely be different every weekend (or at least change monthly) water come in to play on several holes, and every hole is wooded. \nThe Taylor Park Disc Golf Club, the \"Sand Slugs\" keep the course current and updated. Come out and play a round... If you've never played... find a club member on the course- I bet they would let you jump in and let you borrow a disc for a round!"}
{"input": "Awesome place.  Service was great,  food was great, and everyone in the place including staff seemed to be having fun!  Oh and dont forget how beautiful it is! Definitely a new frequent flyer!"}
{"input": "This place is awesome the food is dynamite . Super friendly service. And the. Coup de grace was the flan made in house fresh and believe me I've tried flan everywhere, there's is exceptional. The price was right on point. My only suggestion to make this place go into the stratosphere is if they had a liquor license."}
{"input": "Took awhile for me to get service from the people working because they were busy talking in the back so that made me kinda annoyed, but other then that it was a good meal..Nothing really special."}
{"input": "Disappointing, to say the least.\nThe Hot Wings were unappetizing and tiny. KFC used to be better several years ago. This is the first time I've had KFC since 2012 and sadly the menu choices seem to have gotten worse. Major food revamp is needed. \nAt least the service is better than some fast food places. Feel sorry for the guy working the register. He tried to be helpful but there's nothing much he could do to make it better. Sorry, won't be back."}
{"input": "This place is so lovely. It has everything!! Amazing wine selection, hookah's, Lebanese food which I think is the best in the city."}
{"input": "I loved the idea of dinner with a movie and the people here r really nice. There's nothing bad about this place EXCEPT the terrible sound. The sound in this theater is so quiet u can hear ur neighbors eating their food... Wish the sound was better. The prices r reasonable and worth it cuz movie theater food is normally expensive anyway. Other than the sound this cinema is definitely worth coming to atleast for a try. Overall it was a really fun experience\n:-)"}
{"input": "ONE OF THE BEST AND FRIENDLIEST INDIAN RESTAURANTS IN THIS AREA AND TAMPA. I live nearby and eat a lot of Indian food between California and Florida in my life. Gateway is one of the top 3 indian restaurant I have eaten at. The service is always so friendly and the staff takes time to make small talk with you, which is unusual. I order out or eat in almost every week."}
{"input": "When I returned to pick up my new glasses, I realized that they are horribly out of focus. Apparently they don't measure out the position of the pupils in respect to lenses in order to position the center of focus there. The staff member tried to talk me into repositioning the glasses however for me to see, they would have to be floating on my face and you can only look at he bottom most part. Umm no! Then she stated that she did measure but I don't remember such action being taken.  I asked for the lenses to be redone and they promised to send them off as urgent. Well, still no glasses."}
{"input": "I go to blow bar to get my brows done by natalie (brow specialist) which i highly recommend she is great does a great job on my eyebrows! But then i got a blow by victoria!! Wow i was impress i have thin, straight, dead hair and she left me with the biggest volume ive ever had!!! Tried another girl but didnt like it as much so victoria will be my girl for ever; very beautiful clean place!!!"}
{"input": "Outstanding! Most of their stuff is 110 calories per serving.  That is not a lot compared to ice cream, yet the taste and texture are amazing."}
{"input": "I consider myself a sushi snob, and I was a bit concerned by the 3.5 star rating... and then we showed up to an empty restaurant on a Saturday night... Total red flag, but my 5 friends all wanted to stay. And I'm so glad they did! Wow!\n\nThe food was amazing! They did a great job with the chirashi, miso soup, \"monkey brains\" (fried mushrooms), hamachi nigiri, and a crazy awesome roll called the Imperial Dragon or something like that, which showed up at our table in a dragon-shaped foil wrap and ON FIRE!  It was so good that we had to order a 2nd one. \n\nThe only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is value. The sushi is more expensive than average, and the $20 chirashi only came with 6 pieces of sashimi (+2 masago and 2 crab sticks), much fewer than every other place I've been to.\n\nThe rice was great though, in spite of what some other reviews may say. And the staff and service were great too!"}
{"input": "This is a neighbourhood dive bar on the eastern part of Whyte Avenue.  It's in a strip mall on a one way eastbound side street.  I was there on a Saturday night to check it out. Very average decor with a couple pool tables and a foosball table. It's definitely a younger crowd here.  They had a band and a doorman.  Drinks were reasonable.  A few tv screens.  The wings are always really cheap and come with a carrot and celery stick.  They make pizzas which looked good and cheesy but I did not try. Servers were quite young and pleasant.  The owner gal behind the bar was fine.  I gave it an extra star because I found the previous review a little harsh."}
{"input": "Whenever we want the best sushi in town we have to come here. We almost always get the sashimi and sushi combination, along with a couple different orders of nigiri. \n\nAlways amazing and worth the high price."}
{"input": "Voodoo Bone Lady is a fabulous story teller! Very interesting to listen to. I enjoyed the tour in the French Quarter."}
{"input": "Short waits, strong drinks, great food. Service sets them apart. My bloody was damn good and damn strong. Eat here."}
{"input": "The service seemed pretty rushed. The hostess did not provide good service. The manager was not friendly. The aioli sauce was watery. My burger was not how I requested. Then the waiter did not thank us for coming."}
{"input": "This place is great!\n\nCustomer service: The man I spoke to on the phone was polite and helpful and the delivery was fast. 5/5\n\nFood: I ordered Eggplant Parmesan, Lemon Chicken soup, Baklava, and a soda. Everything was delicious! No complaints whatsoever. 5/5\n\nPrice: Very affordable! If you order delivery before 4PM there is no minimum for your delivery order, and no extra delivery charge. 5/5\n\nReally impressed with this place. I can't wait to try all the other food on the menu!"}
{"input": "Love this place great breakfast and awesome service! Old fashioned interior - very homey feel - wonderful pancakes with perfectly cooked bacon and sausage!"}
{"input": "A downtown without a bookstore is like a downtown without... I don't know I lost the metaphor. It's just sad is what it is. You need books, you need a place to browse, talk with other book lovers, and listen to book readings. Indy Reads is that place. And it's more than that because all proceeds support a great cause, adult literacy. Most of the books are used so donate a book and pick up a new (used) one. You may be surprised at all the books they have that you didn't even know you wanted. They also have a small selection of new books. If they don't have what you're looking for, you can order it. The one thing I don't really like is that the $1 children's books can be jammed so tightly that it's hard to look through them. The kids books are also arranged by color, which makes it harder for me to distinguish between titles as I glance through. Prices are excellent throughout, and the space is really nice. Check it out!"}
{"input": "Wish I had read the reviews before we stopped for dinner.  When we arrived there were only two other tables of patrons and a handful of people at the bar.   They promptly took our food order, but we waited 50 minutes for it to be delivered.   It was only a burger and a pork tenderloin sandwich.   Not sure why we didn't leave other than the fact we were watching football.  Food was just ok.\n\nThe people at the bar were so loud, offensive and obnoxious that I felt uncomfortable for an older couple that was dining.    What kind of management allows this kind of behavior?   \n\nThis place won't last."}
{"input": "This place could be really great.  They have over 100 brews on tap.  We were visiting the area and wanted to try some local beers.  We had ask about several to our waitress who only pointed out the alcohol content and then said she never tried most of them.  When asked to sample a few we were told that we could only pay for a 4 oz. sample for $1.75 but she would ask the manager. She then came back and said no we could not sample without paying. I have been to many tap rooms across America and never charged to taste, my advise to management is to change this policy.  Our party also ordered food, that was good but not great."}
{"input": "I went to see Dr. Taylor because a friend recommended him.  He did appear knowledgeable in many areas but did not listen to or honor the reasons for my visit.  Being a naturopath, he is familiar with both natural and allopathic methods of treatment.  Although his staff said he was familiar with the neurological issues I was asking about, he did little to discuss them with me.  He also did not ask if I wanted a more natural or allopathic approach.  He sent me out the door with an allopathic prescription for something he could have easily addressed with a natural approach.  When I called to cancel my follow up appointment, his staff was curt and dismissive and attempted to make me feel badly about cancelling.  He is not someone I would seek out if I was looking for a kind, respectful medical practitioner."}
{"input": "I don't know what some of these peoples problems are with this place (other than veiled racism) but taking a wedding dress in to be fitted 7 months out is idiotic, regardless of how secure you are in your sizing.\n\nAnyway, I've never had a problem here whatsoever. They aren't all warm and fuzzy, but I'm paying for competence, not smiles, and competent they assuredly are. They got out decade old blood stains out of a ball hockey jersey and have an average turnaround of 2-3 days, even during the holidays and wedding season. \n\nI can't recommend them enough. When we move, we will most certainly still be taking our clothes in here for dry cleaning and alterations."}
{"input": "Okay, yes, I know it's a brewery, but the smell of hops was so strong and overwhelming the night we ate there, we were unable to enjoy our meal. My husband spent the whole time not-so-subtly with his shirt over his nose, and my kids kept begging to leave. I thought the tacos were decent, but we couldn't get past the smell."}
{"input": "Food here is mediocre to good, depending on the day, and what you order.\n I take my (now adult) kids here from time to time. It is a BYOB which I like. I have not been disappointed by anything I have ever gotten here, except the seafood platter, which was over cooked.\nMy daughter got the chicken marsala. Unfortunately she compares it to mine (and mine is very tasty). The marsala sauce was tasty, but the chicken had a very thick coating of flour. This gave a a sticky, doughy texture to the dish. I think the flavor overall is good, but they need to skip the thick coating, and just dust the chicken to make it have a brown crispy coating.\nI had the grilled salmon. It was tasty. And I liked the grilled broccoli. It gives it a better taste, and it was not over cooked.\n3 stars. it is usually good, but not Wow.\nAnd I'll be back."}
{"input": "Great staff. My therapist Maria I believe is her name is great. I got q chemical peel and I already see results. She is very versed in her field. Loved the experience !"}
{"input": "Food good and great location. If you're downtown it's definitely worth stopping in."}
{"input": "My husband chose VW as the venue for last Tuesday's date night. I've been several times (both for lunch and dinner) and man, does this place get better with every meal. Having had the burger more than once (including last Christmas when I indulged in the Whiskey King [oh jeebus, was that good]), I ventured south on the menu and ordered the Kentucky Hot Brown. Cheese and butter lovers unite! This thing was incredible and quite possibly the most underrated thing on the menu (save for their Cobb salad). And good lord, that Irish car bomb milkshake! It alone makes the wait and the consistently snobby hostesses worth it."}
{"input": "Our waitress Kam was amazing and our food was delicious. The manager John made sure to stop by our table and wish my friend a happy birthday. We'll be back!"}
{"input": "Peppermill, you ain't that bad.... Probably the best Reno has to offer... We enjoyed our stay, the decor is outrageous..the food is good."}
{"input": "This is the best Vietnamese restaurant in town! I've seen them (Saigon) transition from a grocery store to restaurant. Their food is always amazing and you can never go wrong. The service can be sometimes feisty but it's all worth it. If you're new to Asian food you can never go wrong with the Viet (chicken, pork, etc.) grilled sandwich or the pho."}
{"input": "We recently used Pure Design for a large event in a nearby hotel. Pure staff met with me to discuss my budget and offered beautiful, unique flower and arrangement selections. Their estimate came in well within my budget. Their staff was always professional and their expertise was obvious. The day of the event, they created such a gorgeous space with all the beautiful arrangements - our guests raved about them, even days after the event was over! I was also able to take home/give away the arrangements, which is not always the case with other florists. And the flowers lasted several days after the event.\n\nI would highly recommend Pure for a large event."}
{"input": "FINALLY!!!! A true non-GMO organic juice and power juice bar joint that serves MEATS & protein! THEY HAVE ORGANIC CHICKEN!!! I was so excited I ordered a second entree to take home! Great for Bulletproof Diet and Paleo peeps..."}
{"input": "Excellent service with reasonable prices. I can always get in right away without an appointment.  They have many pedicure options which all include a massage. Another reason I came back was because my nails looked great for 3 weeks and I received many compliments.  Definitely a relaxing and great experience!"}
{"input": "It was first time visiting. and I didn't know what or how should I order my burger. but the cashier  didn't help me at all. She was so unkind and rude. I will never come back here again!!"}
{"input": "You know, it's okay. It's a nice enough place with decent enough coffee. I went more than once during my trip.  If this is the best New Orleans has to offer however I am afraid to see what the other places look like. Inventive vegan and gluten free options on the shelf with the baked goods (that said - no need to cross the street for the vegan empanada - lots of black beans and not worth the risk).  Crowd is OK; lots of folks homesteading on their laptops as you might expect."}
{"input": "I can't say enough about this wonderful store. The staff knows you before you even walk in the door. I walked in and bought a $50 bracelet for my mother. They treated me like I was buying the Crown Jewels. The put it in a box with gold leaf that with ribbon. It's then placed in a bag with gold leaf. You feel appreciated and valued. \n\nI stood next to a woman buying a string of pearls worth more than an average new car. Everyone is treated exactly the same. \n\nI've come back time and time again. I've bought watches there. I've bought their ceramic money jars. Every time has been a great experience. \n\nThey have a complimentary cookie and beverage bar for customers. They are always their for a quick repair or battery replacement. \n\nThis business is one of a kind."}
{"input": "Food was a 3.5 or so, but our server Kiki pushed our rating up to 4.\n\nOysters on half shell were good (but so damn big!).   BBQ oysters were really tasty.   Turtle soup - solid and spicy.   BBQ shrimp - wife loved it, I thought just ok."}
{"input": "Cute, classy, chic, and cheap! You get some cool finds here varying from handmade to vintage. The owners accessorized me for my prom with their awesome handmade jewelry."}
{"input": "Good for finger foods, appetizers or a late night snack, but their pizzas and sandwiches leave a lot to be desired and it's kind of expensive for what it is. They cook their pizzas on a tray on a conveyor belt which doesn't seem to darken up the bottom like a pizza should be. With so many good mom and pop shops in the area I don't bother ordering pizza or sandwiches from here, though they are still way better than the crap you'd get from one of the national chains."}
{"input": "Friendly sales staff ; ) mike was very helpful ! Took us for a ride in one if the Razors ; ) never know we might get 1 ; )"}
{"input": "Their food was excellent! I was surprised it was fairly empty. Tuscon, you are overlooking a gem!"}
{"input": "this place is amazing. \ni don't get cravings for italian food a lot, but MAN! their meatball sub is heaven... like i want one now... right now... not kidding... \ntheir food is always so fresh and you can taste it. at first i saw their portions and was all \"this is not enough to be called italian\" but half way through you're waving the white flag... but then the food is so nommy you just don't want to stop. and you finally do when you've used the last of their amazing bread to lap up the last drops of sauce... THAT'S ITALIAN!\n\ni never make it to gelato, but the one time i tried some from a friend he ordered \"chocolate covered bacon\" and the base flavor was smooth and delicious, the chocolate covered bacon part started off good... tasted like toffee... then this hickory smoked flavor comes in from left field... needless to say... i'll be getting my own flavors"}
{"input": "Warning, if you come here on a Sunday there is a set tasting menu.  We were a party of two, they served us with one plate, \"family style\".  The only problem is the woman next to us was a party of one and had the same size servings.  They are claiming family style but giving the same portions they give to one person to multiple people. My advice, make sure you request being served as one person with separate plates.  The food was delicious but the business aspect was unacceptable.  Will not come back."}
{"input": "Wish I could've made it back in again. Great atmosphere, great bar with excellent happy hour prices and fifty cent oysters. A bit on the pricey side especially for just a lunch. I'd go back again when I return to this wonderful city."}
{"input": "Love this place.   Best kept secret in Creve Couer.   9 hole course - affordable\nStaff is helpful"}
{"input": "I went the the spa and I thought it was great! The wait was slightly long because there was only one person working there (other than the receptionist). But she threaded my eyebrows and I couldn't have been happier with the outcome. All my friends were extremely satisfied with it too, and she was definitely an expert because she knew that one of my friends had sensitive skin and therefore how to thread it."}
{"input": "Made a quick stop in New Orleans & we're so glad we stopped here for lunch! The food was amazing. We ordered the crab cake and blacked fish - both so fresh and delicious. On top of that, they had $4 bloody mary's!\nThe service was great too - very knowledgeable about the food and the history of the building. They even shared some ghost stories with us, too bad we didn't run into the ghost of Antoine.\nAfter eating we explored the building & sat on the balcony upstairs. The balcony overlooks Jackson Square and it's such a beautiful view. Such a great spot to sit, drink, and hear live music from the street :)"}
{"input": "This is one of my favorite spots for appetizers and drinks. They have a good happy hour, and a very comfortable atmosphere. Their margaritas and quesadilla are two of my favorite items. I love sitting outside and watching the Montecito locals. Great service."}
{"input": "Lunch here was such a lovely experience! Not only was our server attentive, knowledgeable and sweet, but the food was delicious! I've never been to New Orleans (I think I'd get into some serious trouble there, so I've just stayed away!), but I'd like to think that all the cuisine there tastes this great. \n\nGet the crab meat/mushroom bisque...you won't be disappointed, and for the love of God, save room for the banana cream pie. And make sure to take a look around the dining room - it's gorgeous. I hope that someday before I kick it, I'll have a chandelier like the one in the bathroom."}
{"input": "It waa such a nice experience at the rare bird....clean,organized,friendly folks and very easy to walk thru... My only reason for not giving 5 stars is that it is certainly a collector's paradise, not a pickers....meaning kinda pricey,if you are looking for a deal..."}
{"input": "Big ups to the girls who thought my puppy was so cute, they gave her free treats!"}
{"input": "I ordered take out, and both pho soups I ordered were very delicious. The restaurant is clean, staff is friendly, and the service is quick. It was tricky to find the place with Google maps. FYI : It's attached to a 7 eleven. I highly recommend"}
{"input": "Great breakfast for a great price, what more can you ask for!\n\nJust came for a quick dine-in before shopping and must say their 5th St. Benedict was amazingly satisfying. It was the chorizo that was mixed in their gravy which made the perfect combination.\nOh and when you order a cup of coffee, its really a CUP of coffee. Lol\nPlace is small and didnt really have many pastries made the morning i was there. Must be an afternoon thing?\n\nIll be headed back for more of their menu asap.. whenever i fly out there again. :}"}
{"input": "I try and use the libraries and second hand book stores as much as possible but if it's from one of my two favorite authors and I just have to have it now then I hit up the fine folks at this indigo location. It's a huge location with lots of stock and the majority of the friendly staff seem to know the layout pretty well and can easily direct you to what you are looking for. If for some reason they don't have it then they will call another store for you and get it put on hold. They have good deals on gifty knick knacks as well. I was surprised to find they offer the best deals on Pop Vinyl figurines which I am an avid collector of. They also have a large selection of the gifts for the home (e.g blankets and vases) if you are into that sort of thing. A total gem of a chain store if your shopping on the North side!"}
{"input": "Be careful at this shop. They like their money and that's it. When they mess up they just give you the run around about EVENTUALLY fixing it. Nikki the manager is rude and Molly won't fix a tat she messed up."}
{"input": "I had a delicious breakfast at Tuttini a few months ago.  I went back for lunch recently and was excited by their sandwich offerings, however, I was not served.  It was 1:45 PM, and their sign states that they serve lunch until 2:30 PM.  I waited in line for 7 or 8 minutes before a woman came out to tell me that the kitchen was closing.  Closing over 30 minutes early!  She said she might be able to make something to go.  So, if you can make something to go, doesn't that mean the kitchen is not yet closed?  Besides, I wanted to have a few minutes to relax in the cozy restaurant and enjoy my sandwich, not gulf it down on the street, so I left.  I got a sandwich at North Star Coffee around the corner and gave them my $10 instead."}
{"input": "Good hearty breakfasts. As a friend once said, \"if you leave there with any folds in your stomach it's your own d... fault. \""}
{"input": "Pretty decent ice cream but lackluster food.  Got a tuna sandwich here online for pickup, and when I get there, they told me that they \"forgot\" to tell me that they don't have tuna in the restaurant tonight and can cook me something else.  So I was forced to choose another item on the menu of comparable price for them to cook.  I ended up with a grilled cheese which is teeny tiny and dry.  \n\nCome here for Ice cream, but this place is definitely NOT \"more than just ice cream\".  All it really offers is ICE CREAM."}
{"input": "It was delicious! A great location and I loved the atmosphere. Also, both the host and server were very nice."}
{"input": "I live in central NJ.  Tried to make deal on '16 Genesis locally.  Had negative equity Kia Optima lease that was complicating the deal.  No local deals to be had.  Enter Kyle Hill of Fred Beans. The most professional, creative, likeable, and honest car salesman I've ever dealt with.  Made the deal work that nobody else even gave a chance, and located the exact color I wanted.  My Kia went away as well and my new payment was right where I wanted it.  Can't say enough about Kyle and the professional feel of the dealership.  I've read a lot of negative reviews here...I guess every deal stands on its own.  But, for me, nothing but rave reviews. No problem traveling to Doylestown.  Ask for Kyle."}
{"input": "These guys are very accommodating, helped me get my car fixed same day, was only one wheel but had me in and out in about an hour and a fair price.  I'd recommend them!"}
{"input": "Will not go back. Food had close to zero taste. Chicken salad bowl. So bland. Biscuits and chicken. Dry. Fried green tomatoes. Hard. \nVery disappointed. Next time the pancake place across the street."}
{"input": "Was the second patient in the door. Still waited over a half an hour to be seen. Saw the nurse (not practitioner) for a total of 5 minutes and had a throat swab which took another half an hour. $1100. No thanks, I'll not be back."}
{"input": "Hmm...I have never had a bad experience here.  I've probably been here 4 to 5 times, always for dinner, and I think mostly weekends.  Our whole party has always been happy with their food and service.  My burger is always delicious and as a picky beer drinker (IPAs and Pale Ale's only, please), I am more than satisfied with their selection and prices.  I was stoked that they opened a Cheeseburger in Paradise here...I always visit the one in Lahaina town when in Maui."}
{"input": "I drove from Orlando to reach a beach with SUN! I was not disappointed in this public beach. I'm seriously not that hard to please when it comes to beaches, there is something to love about every one I've ever visited.\n\nI had no trouble parking in the spacious public lot--$1.50 per hour--takes coins and cards. \n\nPublic restroom--eh, a little unkempt, but I was able to use it without fear of being contaminated, if you know what I mean. \n\nOutside shower and foot wash to rid unwanted sand from you and your personal belongings.\n\nCabanas and lounge chairs for rent, as well as other beach activities.\n\nExtremely family friendly and clean! No trash anywhere.\n\nWalking distance to Publix, Dollar Tree, and CVS Pharmacy."}
{"input": "A happy and satisfying out-of-the-blue discovery today. That's an understatement...more like \"Blown away!\" Biggest, tastiest (and not greasy, at all) deluxe gyro I've had in St Louis, and I've been eating gyros for nearly 30 years...\n\np.s. The orzo salad was a gem too :)"}
{"input": "Saw this place had good reviews and wanted to try. The drinks don't look as dressed up in person as it does in the photos, but they are good! I got the shatkys rum punch and loved it! Not on the beach but close. So you can enjoy some drinks and head to the beach across the street and vice versa. Service is very friendly as well. Would reccomend :)"}
{"input": "This is my favorite restaurant in Nashville! Incredible sushi and the hibachi is delicious. Make sure you ask for Chad! The guy is a legend in the making. His sauces alone make it worth the trip. I have been here over 10 times and have never had a bad experience. Don't miss out on this Nashville gem."}
{"input": "Food was pretty good. We had a long day and it was good to have delicious indo-chinese food."}
{"input": "Easily the worst gel manicure I've ever had. I called to make an appointment, and Sue did my nails. She rushed throughout my appointment, she was rough on my nails while filing them, and the whole process was incredibly uncomfortable. Each nail ended up a different length, even after I asked her to even them out, and then she began the polish. I ended up with red nail polish all over the edges of my skin and she couldn't be bothered to clean it up. She passed me onto someone else after my nails were done curing and I got the most pathetic little hand massage ever and was sent on my way. The whole process took about 20 minutes, but here I am on day 4 after getting my nails done, and most of them have chipped with two lifting completely. \n\nI called today to see if I could come in to have them repair my nails and was told they would have to decide if they'd fix it or not. My gel manicures normally last between 2-3 weeks easily, so 4 days is completely unacceptable. \n\nWhat a waste of money. I'll never go back."}
{"input": "I think Japanese food is the type of thing where once you've had the good stuff you're ruined for the lower quality version.  This place is popular and people seem to love it, but to me the sushi is not that great.  The nice thing is the price isn't outrageous, as Japanese food often is."}
{"input": "Checked out this new place last night and I really liked it. At last a nice place around Tampa that serves pretty good Mexican street food. They also have a bar and the food is great too. A must visit eatery. Liked the ambiance and the place has a really good vibe to it."}
{"input": "Yayyy for honeygrow ! I honestly can 't believe it took me so long to try this place. It's awesome ! It is in the same complex as my gym and I always said I would give it a shot but didn't seem to make it over there. \n\nWell this past Tuesday it happened and I have a new spot to grab a healthy meal. I ordered the Sour Cherry BBQ stir fry with chicken instead of pork and parsley instead of shallots and it was amazing. Low calorie and OO so filling. While the line was long it went very quickly and my food was ready shortly after that. I love that you can order and pay right on the kiosk. \n\nThe employees were friendly and efficient and all went smoothly. I'll definitely go back."}
{"input": "I finally can get to the business of writing a review on Ted Drewes since I have now tried a few other places, mainly out of driving convenience.  Wow, nothing else compares to the Picasso of frozen custard--Ted Drewes.  I have never had a poorly made custard here.   It truly is an amazing, artfully made dessert.\n\nPlainly put, all of the other custard shop experiences have fallen far short of Ted Drewes.  I always receive a very creamy, delightful and flavorful frozen custard with the perfect mix in and the perfect balance of flavor.  Easily the gold standard."}
{"input": "Wawa has pretty much everything you could want, especially at 3 in the morning. Such a convenient location, especially if you live in the quad and the fact that they are open 24/7 is a lifesaver. From the thrill of using the touch screen to place your order to the f'real shakes, Wawa is just the best place to get everything you need."}
{"input": "Love this place. Friendly staff, quick service, good music, great atmosphere to work OR hang. My personal go-to is the Fedora Frittata and an iced mocha :)"}
{"input": "Wow, 6 tastings of red wine for $20 dollars while enjoying the ocean on a secluded upper deck on the warf. Excellent wine and great friendly service. Found a zinfandel I loved and had a glass. Casual and friendly with ocean breeze,."}
{"input": "Turkey Club was excellent. Quaint.  Good service. Just across from the beaches. Check it out. Big menu. Recommended."}
{"input": "I really, really, really like Fred Meyer. Especially this one on Federal Way. 9.9 out 10 times a great experience. Love the ads, love the e-coupons, love the produce, love the meat department, love the cheese department, love the wine, affordable clothing, gifts, seasonal garden area, toys, playland, pharmacy, and the big sales... I really LOVE that just about every single time I've been here (and it's been A LOT) the customer service is excellent. I feel happy to be spending my money here. That means a lot.\n\nThe pricing is very good if you watch the ads and use their coupons. I love the fuel discount too. The employees are usually in a pretty good mood - and you can feel it. Today my checker was Aaron - and he is AWESOME!\n\nThank you for making it such a pleasant experience in this store. A thousand times - THANK YOU! :)\n\nOh - thanks also for supporting the arts in our community!"}
{"input": "We've eaten at every sushi place in Reno, this is the best we've had.  The fish is really good, and the rolls are very creative.  The Nevada and Taimon rolls are insane.  \n\nThey also have great ice cream and dessert sushi that is outstanding.\n\nNo wait. No lines."}
{"input": "The Pancake Pantry is a great place. Expect to wait in line for .5 - 1 hour, but it's worth it. Also, if one is unable to stand for this amount of time bring something with you. If you haven't tried the Pancake Pantry, these pancakes need to be in or around your mouth as soon as possible. I recommend trying the hash-browns  with your meal."}
{"input": "Just any-old-bar.  I went for a networking happy hour, and the service sucked...I mean, they kept giving drinks to the wrong tables, etc.  Crowded and blah."}
{"input": "If i could give it no stars i would.Worst television  service ever!!! I warn you not to go though with direct t.v! I have had problems with them over charging me since the moment I signed up with them. They even sent me to collections for att Wifi service that I didn't even have!!!!! I would stick with Charter Cable! They are wayyyyy better!"}
{"input": "I just finished my very rushed,very awful experience at Ed's Rec Room. They have recently decided to charge bowling by time, and not by game. This has taken away all of the fun and relaxation from the game, and added an element of annoyance and panic. Also, your time begins to countdown the second you pay for it, leaving you rushing to put on your shoes and put your groups names into the system. And heaven forbid you need to take a bathroom break, or need a beverage! You don't get to PAUSE your time for ANYTHING. They didn't even have a server, so if you're hoping to have a couple beers, better get ready to run quick and get them yourself. The lane even malfunctioned a couple times, but there's no time to wait for a service worker to fix it, because they don't bother extending the time you've lost. I would have rather paid a few extra bucks a game than been forced to play a speedy game to get my monies worth. Extremely unimpressed, and will not be returning until they fix their rates."}
{"input": "Never Ender boutique is a hidden charming place located on Thoma, just west of Center street. It's a cute 1930's house that has been transformed into a boutique and art gallery. The items they carry are one-of-a-kind. Not your typical conforming wares. They carry items that are mostly handmade, and all are made in USA. They focus on carrying items made by artists. The owner, Melanie Crane loves the artists, and carefully selects which items to carry! You will NOT find your usual and typical jewelry, clothing or art. It is all unique with its own identity. Do yourself a favor - do NOT miss visiting this store! I can guarantee you it will not be your last visit. Trust me!"}
{"input": "Really not even going to get into it go to Blue Fin or Masamoto"}
{"input": "Chicken was salty, I ordered 1/2 chicken, rice and plantains to go for lunch. With the chicken and rice, I only received 2 pieces of plantains & paid I've $8 for this meal. Totally not worth it. There were great reviews but it was not my day. I will have to think twice before ordering from here again."}
{"input": "Stopped in for breakfast on 12/2/17 I used to like it here for breakfast.  Service was slow coffee was not hot, grits were only warm and twenty minute wait for cinnamon biscuit after breakfast was brought to table then ten minutes to pay at counter to get out of the place there are better places to get breakfast in the area.  Should have went with my first choice instead of here."}
{"input": "Service was fine (other than our dirty appetizer plates sitting stacked at the end of the table throughout our meal) - Had the mac and cheese appetizer arrived before we placed our order, we probably would have left - Mac and cheese had odd plastic-y taste - Crab cake was bland - seared tuna should have come on a smaller plate (three slices of tuna on top of rice on one side of a rectangular plate) - we ordered a chicken soup to go and had to throw it out when we arrived at our destination because the cardboard cover had popped off the hot cup - pear crisp was the best part - $4 cup of coffee was tepid, at best"}
{"input": "Three Muses is a tapas bar unlike any other I've frequented. Gone is the pretentiousness that are normally associated with tapas restaurants I've visited. Instead there was a really nice, easy going, order from any of us cause it gets loud in here type vibe.\n\nI wish i could remember what we ordered, but there were four of us and we ordered a bit of everything. The sweet potato gnocchi was so good we had to order another round. I also had a blueberry mojito that was divine.  The food came out fast and all of it was just incredible. \n\nWe totally would have spent some serious cash if not for another engagement we had to get to. \n\nOh, get there early, cause this place will get crowded quickly. it's that good."}
{"input": "Place is cozy , good service and food is nice. My wife really likes to come here more because of the place than the food. Little bit pricey."}
{"input": "This hidden diamond is fabulous and the reason going out to eat can be so fun. The food is delicious, interesting, and plentiful! I ordered the chop chicken which was a real treat. If you dine in you also get unlimited soup, and after I finished my meal, the kind owner brought me another big bowl of rice with sauce for free! (Could have just been my good looks.) this place is a diamond in the rough."}
{"input": "First visit to this insurance approved urgent care. Will definitely return as needed. Entire staff was friendly. Very clean, I really like clean! Felt well attended and very satisfied with treatment plan. Would recommend to the rest of my family."}
{"input": "A very sweet find on the main drag, State Street.  Heartfelt, accessible, and reasonably priced (say $20-30 per person total) Argentinian cuisine in a sumptuous but casual white-tablecloth courtyard dining setting.  I can't exactly describe what I had but it involved pork, sundried tomatoes, goat cheese, creamy sauce, and it was fabulous.  Extra points for friendly but unpretentious staff and clean, luxurious bathrooms.  The owners also run a winery  back home and feature their wines here.  I would definitely return."}
{"input": "I've been here a few times and always enjoy their diner-style hotdogs. The place is clean and has plenty of seating. I would certainly recommend giving Texas Wieners a try. \n\nMy one single issue: the fries.\n\nIf this place had crispy, seasoned fries instead of the soft, bland ones... they'd be unstoppable."}
{"input": "We are still fans of Taco Bus over Casita.\nIt was evening when we arrived, and Casita Taqueria had a few customers. We were met with smiles and a very cheerful, charming staff.  They explained the menu to us and we were left to order.  My wife ordered a Shrimp Casitas bowl and I had the Carne Asada taco and the Barbacoa taco.  The meal came out fast and.... well we weren't blown away at all.  I had been waiting for months to come here to the \"Best Taco Place\" in St. Pete, but I was disappointed.  My tacos flavors were muddled and colorless, while the hot sauce was missing that wow factor as well.  The shrimp casitas bowl was just \"ok\" per my wife's review and it too was just missing that something. \n\nSo for service, you guys are awesome!  But for the flavor, we just needed that \"over the top, next-level\", \"umami\" type of mexican that we have been exposed to lately."}
{"input": "Went to this store to get a passport sent to England A.S.A.P (which weighs next to nothing), they told me it would be $110 for 4 day delivery with no guarantee that it would arrive by then. I went to Fed Ex who told me they could do it for $57 with a 2 day guarantee. Shop around before using UPS!!!"}
{"input": "We were here drunk as all heck. after closing time. our guys at larry's hooked us up with leftover cheesesteaks and a meatball. not only was this the best drunk experience of our young lives, but we owe our lives to the workers at larry's. god bless, you have our business for life. thank you and god bless."}
{"input": "Our group of 6 decided to try something different.  So,  we gave this place a shot.   Very happy with our decision. \n\nThe wife and I shared the special,  which was a massive amount of food for the two of us.   It was a great sampling of all their food options. \n\nThe chicken, steak and rice/beans were pretty amazing.  I could do without the egg,  but it was easy enough to push over to the side.   I'm not a fan of Yuca, but this wasn't bad.   The plantains were delicious.   I didn't try the salad... Just wasn't in the mood for it. \n\nAll in all,  the place is a must visit if you are up for trying something new."}
{"input": "This place is fine for an easy salad and beer on the patio. That's about it. While it's a Webster Groves staple, it seems to be quickly falling behind the many new spots that are coming into the area."}
{"input": "We used to go here quite a bit, but haven't been in a few months.  The food and service was always great in the past.  Today the service was completely horrible.  The margarita was the worst I've ever had.  The whole bottom of the glass was covered in salt.  It wasn't drinkable and the server didn't offer to make me another one or to take it off the bill.  The server had a really hard time taking our order.  He was probably new because he didn't know the menu.  He dropped off our food, but left the table so fast that we couldn't even ask for sauce for our tacos.  He didn't come back to check on us until after we were finished eating.  The food was okay, but very bland without sauce.  Very disappointing."}
{"input": "We love, love, love Gia's! Consistently great service. The pizza is delicious. As their standard crust is thin St. Louis style, we prefer the thick crust, which is more like a typical pan pizza. The sauce is slightly sweet, so good. We love the BLT and the Gia's house salad- which feeds at least two. We hope to keep eating there for years."}
{"input": "I've now tried quite a few of these strange donuts and all have been delicious and interesting.  A few favorites: The strange bacon, iDonut, and the fritters!  \nThis isn't your typical donut shop so if you're bothered by unique ingredients, friendly faces, colorful decor, or reviving a great neighborhood, don't shop here!"}
{"input": "Horrible customer service. Major attitude problem. Been to many Starbucks in US and in other countries definitely do not follow the Starbucks great customer service model."}
{"input": "Found Player's while driving by. Everyone is very friendly. The service is great. Atmosphere is very relaxed. Great experience overall. Oh and a great shave and cut for a great price!"}
{"input": "I have eaten here a number of times and the food is phenomenal every time.  It doesn't look like much from the outside but it is one of my favorite breakfast places in the area.  Their lunches and dinners are just as amazing, particularly the home-cooked dinner specials. I was told the owners mother cooks then herself."}
{"input": "Had three things here, they were all excellent. The buffalo chicken cheesteak, the veggie wings and the margaritas.\n\nDefinitely going there again."}
{"input": "More and more underwhelming with every visit. \n\nThe first time I came, I enjoyed it. Charming, quaint, simple. Glass of wine, good salad. Good times. \n\nReturn! Grainy, bland, mac and cheese. Still, a gorgeous day, another gorgeous glass of wine. \n\nThird time (and likely last visit). French onion soup was poorly-flavored onion water with an abundance of cheese and crouton. Special chicken-prosciutto creamy pasta was under-seasoned (but thank you for the salt and fresh pepper grinder at the table so I can season my own food). It's not like I just added a sprinkling of pepper to enhance. There was absolutely no taste. What I consider an abundance of salt was added - unacceptable for a $17.50 plate of pasta. Chocolate mousse was well-textured, chocolatey, but could have been richer. Too sugary sweet.  \n\nI will likely never experience this place for a fourth trip. It's just not good enough, and who wants to go to a restaurant that's a crap shoot?"}
{"input": "I absolutely love this place.  Every time I have gone here I have received yummy food and excellent service. Can't say it any plainer than that.  \n\nBest tomatoes I have ever tasted (well outside of those from my grandmother's garden) yummy crab cakes, and a great assortment of wine (white sangria is my current fave).  Would be a great place to assemble a gift basket of local stuff for a friend or relative."}
{"input": "Pizza is made to order anyway you like it. Thin crust & very tasty. Line gets long at lunch but worth the wait."}
{"input": "I started working with Page One Power back in 2012 after meeting the owners at an Expo in NYC.  The initial project was a social media test that we came up with while discussing some exotic strategies.  After the project ended I was so impressed by their organization that I continued the relationship by having them building links for several of our B2C websites.  I worked with them to develop 3 specific link-building strategies and they implemented them for our sites.  The results have been great!  On occasion I've actually had to ask them to slow down building links to avoid running afoul of the search engines (specifically G).\n\nI've always found the team to be both responsive and quick do whatever it takes to make a campaign successful.  I've worked with many SEO agencies over the years but Page One Power has been the most professional and easy to deal with by far."}
{"input": "Perfect for the under 5 set. It is a bit spendy for a family of 4, of 2 adults and 2 children, but if you live here locally, you could get a pass. Lots of interactive, hands-on exhibits, made for wiggly little boys and girls who want to climb and splash and run."}
{"input": "Great dinner tonight - Tomato and Crab salad had loads of fresh crabmeat and advocado; spicy hoseradish roumelaude dip on the side.  Nice.  The Softshell Crab Pontchartrain was delectable - creamy sauce, angel hair pasta, and a devine deep fried soft-shell crab.  Yes, the decor could be better, but the food and staff make it very welcoming. Will return."}
{"input": "We had an excellent night wine tasting. We had the introductory package. It was an excellent taste of two white and three reds for only $10.  This was my second trip there and I plan to go again with more people."}
{"input": "Great wine bar to people watch and enjoy a day or night out!  Take your girlfriends or a date."}
{"input": "Great local pizza with awesome owner and employees. Authentic NY style pizza at a great price. They also have great sandwiches especially the pulled pork. Open late for midnight snacks and have great lunch time specials. If you work around Westshore Joes pizza is a great spot to grab a quick bite to eat."}
{"input": "First time at Tara's and I'm sure I'll be back!  I wish I knew my nail tech's name because he was really terrific. I came in to get a gel refill and one tip replaced. My nails needed a lot of work and he didn't cut any corners. I'm really particular about the thickness of my nails and I've had people give me gruff for asking for them thinner, my guy today did them perfectly from the start and was very willing to make changes when I briefly questioned the thickness (I couldn't tell they were perfect already because there was still dust on them from shaving them into shape). And in the end, the price was more than fair for the quality of work! \n\nRegarding the mani/pedi situation: I didn't get either but I witnessed one of each while I was there and I think anyone would be happy and relaxed getting one.\n\nAlso, I took notice that the place was really clean, which is comforting. And they played modern music, which I prefer to the classical or sound machine noises some places play."}
{"input": "Cold day some weeks ago...had heard great recommendations and went there to enjoy the food and scenery.  Very pretty spot\n\nThe order was pasta with clans and lobster tacos.  Both tasted good but nothing special. By he seating out door was a mess but we were hungry\n\nAn ok place."}
{"input": "Staff is amazing!  Coupons on their website are for 40 percent off a regular priced item... so that means... you are always getting something on sale!\n\nWe went in one evening at around 15 minutes before closing to grab some things very quickly... and all staff members were very helpful even so close to closing!  \n\nGreat store!"}
{"input": "This is the cutest mom/pop local, high-quality ice cream joint in all of Tucson! Delicious... But definitely a bit pricey ($4.50 for a regular single scoop)- hence the 4 stars as opposed to 5."}
{"input": "WOW!!!!! I can't say enough great things about this establishment. Beyond excellent customer service. Food is really good and the presentation is awesome. This was absolutely my favorite place to eat when I lived in Nashville. And did I mention the great customer service!"}
{"input": "Found Akoi based on high reviews online. I went with a friend and her daughter; we all had a good time. The ladies who serviced us were polite and friendly, and they did an excellent job. The atmosphere of the nail salon was sophisticated and trendy compared to most salons I've seen."}
{"input": "If you're from NY or north jersey then these bagels cannot compare to those bagels. Night and day. These bagels are huge tough dough balls. They are no better than what you'd get at a grocery store. If you're from around the area, then you'll find them ok, but they are nothing like a real NY bagel."}
{"input": "The place is on the small size but the food is cheap and good. I would avoid the smoothies and bubbles. You can taste the powder in the fruit smoothie and bubbles are hard. You have to look carefully when driving down the street you may pass it"}
{"input": "OWC is a super cute, quaint little coffee shop with great coffee and modern decor. Great find for day one Reno."}
{"input": "Good unique Mexican food, very cool atmosphere, will definitely be coming back! Oh and their mojito's are probably the best I've ever had."}
{"input": "Ever get sick of sitting at a bar trying to order a nice wine or beer and your surrounded by loud families munching down 8 dollar chicken fingers for 4 pieces and Mozzarella sticks fresh from last week? Well of you want a snazzy place where you can eat at the bar, have stellar drinks then be served decadent French food then Slate Bleu will tickle your fancy. It's a restaurant where you can eat at the bar but you don't feel like you're at a bar. Check out Wednesdays with their all night happy hour from 4-10. I mean who does that?!"}
{"input": "I'm not a coffee connoisseur so I'm not reviewing it based on that. What I am reviewing it on is the fantastic ambiance it has, the free wifi, and the long meeting table that's available for everyone.\n\nWhenever I want to hang out and work downtown at a cafe, Roast is the first place I go to. \n\nMy only real complaint is that during some hours, this place is PACKED and so that may put a kink in your plans if you wanted to meet someone there for a meeting. Also wifi is sometimes touch and go. I wish more cafes installed the fastest wifi with signal boosters around the place to make it more useful for those who telework.\n\nI also love that this place is open LATE!"}
{"input": "The service is awesome...staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.  Go check it out! Tried the deviled eggs...Devine! The fig and goat cheese, serrano and margherita flatbreads were delicious as well."}
{"input": "I stopped here at my stop to Santa Barbara, coming down to LA from San Francisco. The food was amazing, and delicious. I would recommend anyone who like authentic Mexican food to stop and eat here. Good place."}
{"input": "Amazing Creamery -- a great selection of flavors! \n\nI sampled a variety of flavors before I had to make the tough decision of choosing which ones to eat! My friends ended getting the awesome sampler scoops (4 flavors for $5 or 6 flavors for $7) and was able to try so many flavors! I ended up with two delicious flavors -- Red Velvet and Strawberry Sangria in a waffle cone! \n\nThe decor was super cute-- chalk boards with flavors written on there in a colorful fashion, and hand made drawings were dangled about. The fill of fresh made waffle cones also permeated the air, really riles up the sweet tooth in a person. (;\n\nNoteworthy flavors:\n- Creole Cream cheese (cheesy vanilla goodness)\n- Champagne Violet (really good vanilla flavor with a hint of floral)\n- Red Velvet (cream cheese goodness with chunks of red velvet cake throughout)\n- Strawberry Sangria (fresh strawberry taste in sorbet form)\n- Pop (tastes like strawberry cream soda!)"}
{"input": "Everything is great except the A/C kicks at 10am to where it makes it too cold to hang out. It has been this way for months and I'm not sure why they don't change it. I would rate 5 stars if the A/C functioned properly. Please fix it."}
{"input": "One of my all time favorite breakfast spots anywhere! The vegetarian sausage and egg biscuits are so freakin good and like lots else on them menu- nap inducing. Great homemade food and desserts. Diner style with fast service and a long wait that's worth it. Get there as soon as they open for shorter wait. Lunch options are also good."}
{"input": "Great addition to the Lansdale bar scene. Great beer and great food. Awesome servers and bartenders. Say hi to GM Joe!"}
{"input": "The steak is okay. I give it a 1 because it's not worth the price. Very expensive. You can find a much better steak at other restaurants in town. Plus, my experience was dampened by some annoying couple trying to sell me real estate as I ate at the bar."}
{"input": "Went here on a pub crawl so my review is only for the bar area.  Place was nicely set up on the inside. I am not much of a mixed drink drinker since I tend to lose my inhibitions when hard liquor is involved.  The two drinks that were recommended to me were a Pim's cup and Sazerac.  I went with the Pim's cup and it was one of the best mixed drinks I have had in a really long time. It was very smooth and very refreshing. The cucumber garnish gave it a nice twist.  Would like to go back for dinner and try the food."}
{"input": "Kelly's has changed hands and the menu has completely changed.  It's clear they've had to defend this and it seems to annoy them.  I mean the menu was epic - why change it?\n\nIn response, the new crew touted the place being cleaner and it was.\n\nI got the  classic burger and fries.  I'll be honest, it was the worst $11 burger that I've ever had.  Dry and flavorless and made me envy a $2 McDonalds bacon burger flashing on the TV.  The fries were OK.\n\nI was shocked to just walk in at dinner time.  This wasn't possible before.  Now I know why.\n\n:"}
{"input": "I LOVE this place. Best veggie burger in town (handmade patty!!)! And the pretzel buns?? YUM."}
{"input": "Went to lunch today with some fella's.  we all got the Wednesday specials- I got the shrimp étouffée with a side salad. The étouffée was a good size portion the meal was delicious(9.99 can't beat that and if you can you can beat the mission of the cafe) The other two tried the pot roast with the two sides both were happy! For dessert we split a bread pudding THE best in the city. Great visit as always and the renovation are wonderful. Have been going to cafe reconcile for 5 years now and always walk out happy!"}
{"input": "Service great, food awful \nWe went there for a Sunday brunch. Our waitress was great, provided nice service. \nWine was great too. BUT the food was horrible. Something as simple as omelet was not eatable. It was cold, too oily and just didn't taste well. Potatoes that came with it were of strange color and didn't taste the way they were suppose to. I had much better omelette sat regular diners."}
{"input": "I was very pleased with my experience here!  Good, fast service--you can linger after your meal because you've paid up front. \n\nAnd, most importantly the food is fresh and tasty!  I loved my chicken taco salad and the plantains we got.  The drinks, especially the mojito, were good too. \n\nWill definitely be back to try more things."}
{"input": "Everybody in our lab is a fan of their food, and we all come from different parts of the world and glad we agreed on this immediately. It's a frequent lab lunch spot. Their buffet is just fantastic, everything is cooked spot on and nowhere beat their price. I normally have to skip dinner after their lunch buffet cuz I just can't stop eating over there."}
{"input": "Great service, great oysters.\n\nAll the doors/windows open air to Bourbon St. Nice place for lunch."}
{"input": "My Aunt and I stayed here for a few nights in December. \n\nThe location is GREAT being very close to State St., pier, zoo etc.. \nThe staff was AMAZING!! The girls who work in the front were extremely helpful, even offering us local family owned options for dining.\nThe chef, Jenny does an amazing job with feeding 50+ people a day. She was very friendly, and she's an amazing local chef.  \nParking is kind of crummy, but we ended up always getting a spot. \nParking on the street is allowed on weekends, with a permit (which the inn does not provide)\nThe inn offers free bike rental! How great is that!!\nI was very pleased with the Inn and will be back again for sure!"}
{"input": "The staff are lovely and the interior is modern, but the food is entirely mediocre. Small portion sizes, which would be fine except that these \"tapas\" are priced up to $20. The fried chicken was tasty, but the herb garlic chicken was just bizarre in taste. And somehow each dish was topped with the same spring greens mix for no apparent reason than to take up more space on the plate. It's a nice trendy place for a drink, but go only for the atmosphere and not for the food."}
{"input": "Love going here for happy hour or dinner!  Great patio with fans to beat the StL heat!   Also...very accomodating at this location.  I like the Veal Milanese but with mixed greens instead of pasta!  they'll modify the menu to suit your taste!"}
{"input": "Best bloodies in the French Quarter!  Hit this place after grabbing a few beers on Bourbon.  One sip of this bloody and I gave out a big ol' shout!  \"God dayum that's a good bloody!!\".  Then promptly ordered a second.  I'm no foodie, but this was really good and worth a little skirt off Bourbon St."}
{"input": "As always, the pizza is great.  The best pizza I've had since moving away from Chicago.  The service is horrendous.  Plan on being ignored and others getting their food before yours but I guess the pizza is worth it..."}
{"input": "Incredibly unfriendly staff. The place a filthy disaster. Dirty dishes all over the place. Trash bags sitting out like someone attempted to change the trash. They were out of many things at the drink area (lids, napkins). Used the lack of a cook as an excuse for all their issues but positioned it as an inconvenience to them and not apologetic to customers at all."}
{"input": "Large menu. Clean restaurant and restroom. Friendly staff. They were fairly busy in the middle of the day when we visited. This was my first time here and all we had was a sandwich so I can't give them 5 stars yet but for a family style restaurant and bar we enjoyed our meal. They had a decent draft beer selection and also serve wine and mixed drinks. There are crayons on every table and instead of a single place mat they put a large sheet of white paper on the tables for the kids to draw on."}
{"input": "Jack Dempsey's is an old school seafood gem in a neighborhood of new school options. A ninth ward hold out from another era- unpretentious, authentic, and delicious. Their servings are huge. Get the gumbo with a side of potato salad."}
{"input": "A much cleaner and much more inviting environment separates Blueberry Hill from other pancake houses.  I was greeted and seated immediately after entering.  The energy in the restaurant was great.  The staff was interacting with the customers as if many of them were friends.  Nick, the owner, was eating at one of the tables and would get up and help the staff and check on the customers.  I was pleasantly surprised by the overall cleanliness of the restaurant.  I had the house omelet. The Greek inspiration for this omelet was a pleasant change from the normal omelets served in most breakfast places. Yes, they do call their fries \"Freedom\" fries.  I personally appreciate this and would like to compliment Nick for it.  I would definitely recommend Blueberry Hill to anyone."}
{"input": "Wawa is what it is. A convenient store that has an array of options.\n\nThe prices are reasonable. Their food is only okay though. I've had their sandwiches a few times. My biggest gripe is I do not like their tomatoes. I think they freeze them and as a result they are always a little hard. I could be wrong about the reason, but they are hard none-the-less.\n\nThey also have a few pre-made hot items. The hot dogs are okay. But it's hard to mess up a hot dog. They hot breakfast sandwiches and snack items are below average. Cheap and quick but so not worth it.\n\nGo hear for a candy bar, drink, or other package snack item. Don't go here for anything that's actually prepared by them. It's just not that good."}
{"input": "This is as good as Thai gets.   I liked the duck.  It's wonderful."}
{"input": "Because when I say I want a non smoking room,it doesn't mean put me a a smoking floor in an enclosed hotel in a non smoking room. I don't want to smell that shit EVERYTIME I walk out my door. Won't be back. Thats why I called at 3:00 to make a resi so I could get a good room. But he wouldn't make me a reservation."}
{"input": "Hands down the best gyro I have ever had.  I have liked pretty much every gyro I have ever eaten because really, what is there NOT to like? So what makes this one stand apart?\n\nThe variety of gyro toppings/meat choices/sauces isn't staggering, but definitely impressive nonetheless.  A gyro with hot sauce?  SIGN ME UP!  It was called the gyro picanti and it was the most scrumptious meat treat I can remember ever eating.  The presentation is tight and it is perfectly layered to make each bite complex.  The hot sauce plays off the tzatziki as if it was meant to be (think blue cheese and wings).  \n\nWhile the gyro was inspired, the pasta salad was nothing to write home about and this is clearly a take-out place as their is nothing inviting you to stay and sit.  You have to get your own silverware and such.  \n\nWinner, winner gyro dinner."}
{"input": "After reading reviews we headed for Herbie's for brunch yesterday. 'Sorry to say it was a big disappointment. We waited  15 minutes to place a drink order and it took another 20 minutes for the drinks to arrive. They must have driven to the brewery to get that Bud Light. A Bloody Mary can't possibly take that long to make, can it? Our food was good but lukewarm.  Eggs Benedict just taste better when they are hot.  We won't be back."}
{"input": "This was my first visit ever to a Roly Poly. I was impressed with the size of the menu. I was expecting it to be more like Subway and only have a dozen sandwiches. This was more like a dozen for each different type of meat. I had the Italian wrap, which was delicious. Everything was incredibly fresh and super tasty. I can only speculate on how good the other wraps are. I guess I'll have to go back again a few times."}
{"input": "I've eaten at porcini two or three times now and it is totally tiny and cramped but I've never been disappointed with my meal. I would agree that it can be uncomfortable if it's too crowded but if you've been there before or if you've read these reviews then just know that's the case and expect it!  the food is always fresh and filling and the owner treats everyone like a regular. I would agree that you can do a cheaper BYO for sure, but I would definitely recommend it anyway.  It's certainly deserving of at the very least three stars across the board and if you hit it on the right night and it's not totally slammed it's 5 stars for sure."}
{"input": "Johnny Rockets is on the pricey side, you aren't getting outta here with a burger and fries for any less than 10 bucks (and that's without a drink). The burgers are 6-7 bucks and definitely solid for the price though. I had the Route 66, 1/3 pound, nice soft potato roll, meat good and lean, pretty damn tasty and satisfying. Wish I could say the same about the fries/rings (I tried the mix) but they're the standard freezer bag affair, and the fries are actually sub-par (dry and not much flavor, worse than most fast food fries). The onion rings were better, but of course they cost almost twice as much.\n\nI'll be back to try more burgers but would suggest just sticking to the burger or cheesesteak with no sides (maybe grab a shake for dessert instead ... the basic hot dog at $3 also costs about the same as an order of fries)."}
{"input": "Love this hotel!  Perfect location in the French Quarter.  It is a block from Bourbon St. and walking distance to everything in the FQ.  Staff is friendly and the hotel is nice and clean.  Will definitely stay here again."}
{"input": "Very fresh and tasty but chinsy on the meat (I had the roast beef and cheese primo).  With all the great places to dine in, take out or otherwise satiate your soul with some of the best food on the planet, I will not return here."}
{"input": "I went in open minded to a place I hadn't heard positive reviews about. The reviews are correct. Broken Beaker is a disappointment. Their display is low grade and simplistic in a bad way. There is no glass to separate the consumer from the display which contains dust and cracked glass on the inside. I tried the molecule mule and it was nothing but simple syrup and lime, for $10. You can get the same thing at Marsh for less. I was told the tour was great, but was disappointed when I had to self guide myself through there back room/ distillery. The equipment has the beginning look of the Statue of Liberty as the green sets in and equipment shows continual signs on not being cleaned. Patina is not cool in a distillery. Would I recommend Broken Beaker, absolutely not. Unless major improvements are made it does not belong on Mass ave. Good Luck"}
{"input": "Two stars for the friendly gesture of staffs and ambience. My bf and I went here to get a Thai massage for Valentine's Day. This was our second visit. Our first one was at their old spot and we got deep tissue which was pretty good actually. However, let's just say Thai Massage isn't their thing. I've had several other Thai Massage and it's always been \"crack\" here and \"crack\" there. This was really soft and almost felt like we were in for light stretching. We were disappointed with the massage we received especially when we were out for a celebration."}
{"input": "Omg This place is amazing. All of the food taste so fresh and organic. I'm so full. I had the Deluxe Scramble and it was probably one of the best scrambles I have ever had. The waitress is extremely friendly and welcoming. It's a nice small place with delicious food and extremely affordable. I will definitely visit again when in town."}
{"input": "Place was a nice hidden gem on maggazine st. Donuts for days and bomb sliders. If you want to get fat eat here. Got the maple bacon donut salted caramel donut and coconut cream. All were yum yum. Then got the fried chicken slider oyster, duck, and pork belly sliders. Fried chicken was the best. All needed more spread/sauce but still yummy. Most affordable lunch we had in NOLA"}
{"input": "This place is a great concept! The food was delicious and fresh. Service was prompt and courteous. You can't beat the prices either. My husband had the traditional Monday special in NOLA, red beans and rice. It was a generous bowlful that came with a side salad and bread. He added the grilled chicken, and got 3 large boneless pieces. I got a cup of gumbo and two a la carte sides. The gumbo was full of smoked sausage and tender chunks of chicken. My sides were smothered okra with shrimp and mac and cheese. The okra was yummy, although a bit skimpy on shrimp. The mac and cheese was outstanding. All of this, along with 2 iced teas was less that $30. I would definitely come back."}
{"input": "Everything here is perfect! We go to Ralph's for every special occasion. The ambience is magnificent with the dreamy oaks trees lined up on City Park for an outside view. The service is always five star.  But the food, the reason for going in the first place is what should and does stand out. Here the food is truly memorable. The short ribs appetizer alone is worth going back for again and again. Oh and the chocolate doberge cake is perfection. They have delicious special drinks each month that proceed a charity, giving you a reason to drink if you ever needed one. Ralph's is definitely a special place."}
{"input": "Cleanliness is an issue here.  It's a great spot for a quick toenail trim but it smells like dog and is full of dust at the front desk and hair all over the floor.  I've heard others say they'd not take their dog here but it not THAT bad!"}
{"input": "Our cabdriver from the airport told us last night to hit up The French Market for authentic Nawlins food. So we did. Walked around for a bit and saw this place. Pretty simple menu. I haven't had a po boy yet so I ordered the buffalo shrimp po boy, which came with fries and cole slaw. The folks behind the counter were very friendly. \n\nHe po boy was amazing, granted I haven't had one before to compare it with. The shrimp was breaded just right, the bread was soft, and the hint of buffalo sauce and blue cheese crumbs were perfect. \n\nThe fries were breaded and seasoned just the way I liked it. Didn't have a chance to try the coleslaw because I think I forgot."}
{"input": "I've been here several times and my cat Toothless is under one of their Wellness Plans. The vet techs and vets are always very nice and helpful when it comes to checking her in, and unless there's a difficult case ahead of me, the check in is always quick and easy. They're also very good about contacting me when someone new or a potential problem comes up, and they call if they need to run any other checks. The price is a little much which is an issue with any vet that I've noticed, but they always treat Toothless very well and I've never had any problems with them."}
{"input": "This is the place I order takeout from when the Metairie Mardi Gras parades make my neighborhood a nightmare to navigate through - from where I live I don't have to cross any parade lines to get to it. And thank goodness for that.\n\nThe restaurant itself - I think it's the smallest of all the Sake locations, so it feels a bit more intimate here. The menu is the same as at the others, from what I can tell.  Service is prompt and prices are reasonable. Unfortunately it's way the hell out in Harahan, so I rarely have a reason to frequent it. Unless its Carnival season, and I'm hungry, and those damned parades make getting anywhere a pain in the neck."}
{"input": "As Outbacks go, this one is complexly in sync.  Service was good, food was good and unless you have not ever been to an Outback, nothing much I could say in a review would give you a whole lot of insights.  Some folks don't like chains but I do.  There is a lot to be said for standards and familiarity that you don't always get.   Outbacks  and its sister restaurant are consistently good, and offer good value.  That is why there is usually a line!"}
{"input": "Yelp helped me find this place and the first tip they were on to something was that I was the only non-spanish person in the restaurant which was a great sign. I got the carne asada which was a huge steak with awesome baby spring onions and really nicely flavored rice and beans. Not your generic comes with everything dish, but really thoughtful, well flavored accompaniment. Definite thumbs up!"}
{"input": "We stopped into Nashville as a overnight on our way south.  Found this little gem of a diner on Yelp.  We ordered the Praline French Toast, Bananas Fosters Pancakes, and Donut Breakfast Sandwich.  Mentioned to the very sweet waitress that we were sharing and she was kind enough to bring us extra plates.  All I can say is WOW!!  My favorite was the Praline French Toast.  The bread, actually a slice sweet roll was very light and the dish was surprisingly not over sweet.  I'm not a big banana flavor fan , but I did taste the pancakes. Again, light as air and delicious.  The donut sandwich was also a delight.  The well seasoned sausage went perfectly with the slight sweet donut bun.  The staff was kind & attentive. Atmosphere was fun. All in all a GREAT Nashville experience."}
{"input": "It was so good we had to come back twice and bring a friend. The Charbroiled Oysters  and the Shrimp Boat is magnificent. The owner J and the rest of the crew were a delight as well. They are pretty laid back so if your a east coaster like me go next door to the organic banana and get a rum infused piña colada or daiquiri and chill until your food is ready. I highly recommend you stop by If your visiting the French Market if your not I say go there anyway!"}
{"input": "Food is excellent!\nPeople are welcoming, choices are long list. Sandwiches have great meat in them. Hand made toasted ravioli is some of the best in town."}
{"input": "Love the revised interior very much NWO style/Parisian bistro style. It is cozy.  Conversation & cocktails were enjoyable versus TVs and sports.  Service was friendly and prompt.  Drinks, we tried several of the house cocktails of Sazarac's (repeated numerous times) & Joe Christmas were very solid.  Kudos to the mixologist - not everyone can consistently craft cocktails - at least in my extensive research.\nAlso various local draft beers were tried and a Bordeaux for good measure.\nApps of blackened shrimp and hominy hush puppies were tasty.  Dinner ranged from Blackened Red Fish Po'Boy served w/ Cajun chips, crab stuffed Missouri catfish to Shrimp & Grits. All were pleased with our choices and nothing remained once we were done. Dessert of Whiskey Caramel baked Alaska was shared.  All three of us agreed L'Acadiane hit all the marks on our list of solid cocktails, local beers, good wine; delectable food, great service and atmosphere that makes you want to linger."}
{"input": "Claudio's fresh mozzarella tastes like biting into a cold glass of milk (without the dangerous glass-eating part, cause don't try that).\n\n I'm telling you that it's so delicious. So freshy. I love their ricotta too. \n\nActually, I usually go in for just those two items but end up leaving with multiple bags full of way more cheeses than any two people should have on hand at one time... and olives and beautiful dried pastas...and any number of selections from the deli counter that taunt me as I wait in line. Salumi speaks to me."}
{"input": "I have never found this market to be anything sensational except that when I need something not run of the mill like honey with the comb or something organic, I usually find it here.  They stock a lot of not seen everywhere items and the store appears very clean unlike a few in the neighborhood."}
{"input": "The food was great, the service excellent.  Had dinner outside on the deck, saw lots of dolphins.  Will come back for sure."}
{"input": "Cheu has really come into its own. When I was last here half a year ago, I was less-than-impressed, but this time, the staff was friendlier and the ramen was close to perfect.\n\nWe came for a late lunch, minutes before they were supposed to close at 3pm. The waiter still good-naturedly accommodated us, providing fast and attentive service. \n\nThe noodles were chewy, and whereas last time they were a little clumpy, this time, they were perfect. The broth was not too salty and somehow managed to be full flavored and (refreshingly) light at the same time. The meat was meltingly tender, though a little broken-up for my tastes, and the soft-cooked egg was perfect.\n\nWe also ordered a special grapefruit juice, whose tart flavor complimented the ramen and served nicely as a palate cleanser.\n\nAfter eating ramen, I often fall into a sodium stupor and feel mildly ill for at least half a day, but after Cheu ramen, I felt pleasantly full. The attentive service and delicious ramen made for a much-improved experience."}
{"input": "Our second time to Cafe Fleur De Lis!\n\nWe went to their other location a couple days ago.  The food was so good (had the shrimp n grits) that we had to come back for more!\n\nThe prices were reasonable for what you get.  The quality of food were good with service to match.  \n\nI loved their shrimp and grits, but this time I had to try their Seafood Benedict (Seafood cakes made of crawfish and crab mixture).  It comes with a choice of hash brown (has a slight little kick) or grits.  My friends had the traditional breakfast of eggs Benedict and vegetable omelette. The coffee was good,  and so was the mocha coffee ( piled high whipped cream with drizzled chocolate on top). \n\nOverall, our second dining experience was great.\n\nThis is a little hidden \"Foodie Find\" and gem of a place.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"input": "I had Pita Kebob cater a dinner (iftar) recently for an event for about 150 people. The amount of food was beyond what I expected. They were very generous with the amount of food.  At the end of the night there wasn't anything left. I saw people making doggy bags to take home. Everyone loved the food! There was salad, yellow rice, chicken and beef kabob, and shawarma. \n\nThe Greek salad was amazing. Light dressing and full of fresh ingredients. And a great amount of feta cheese! Which was perfect for me because I love feta cheese. \n\nThe rice was very flavorful and delicious. I went back for more! yum! \n\nI will be catering from this restaurant again!"}
{"input": "Absolutely delicious !!!  Friendly staff, clean, cozy place.  Tasty food.  Great vegan options!"}
{"input": "Great ambiance. I love smoky flavors, and Marje's is like Eau de Smoke perfume. Not only if the food great, but there are quite a few satisfying selections that meet the Weight Watchers criteria for good choices. Bonus! And friendly service."}
{"input": "Jaki C promised me Mrs K would like the place.  So  the Mrs,  Chip K his Mrs K. and myself went to Izakaya.  Jacki warned about the kinks and yes they have them.  They only had one fry cook and he/she was overwhelmed to say the least.  The place was not crowded but with the variety on the menu would be daunting for one person.  We managed to spend $91.  Don't know how things that cost $2 to $7 works out to that much but it did.  I had a California roll, chicken on a stick one with sauce and one with salt and pepper also had a beef stick and pork belly with asparagus wow was that good.  With a chaser of calamari.  Sounds like a lot of food but the meat on a stick is one bite per person.   My best dish of the night was the beef on a stick.  Tender moist with a slight chewiness that was perfect.  It was fantastic.  Wife had the shrimp tempura and it looked great and she said it was good.  So super slow food coming out of the kitchen knocked the review down one   Really can't wait to go again."}
{"input": "This is a convenience store deli, so don't expect a neat restaurant setting or drink service (that's the only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5). I've had a Cuban press one time, and a breakfast sandwich at another time. Sandwiches are prepared upon your order and I was very happy with the food. Delicious! There are some tables inside and some outside on the dock, overlooking ocean. There is a more popular breakfast place (Maggie Mae's) in the same strip mall but taste-wise I must say I like this deli much better."}
{"input": "I like it. The atmosphere is festive and there is a nice variety of music in Spanish. Service is attentive and they got my picky order straight.\n\nIt was a boring salad made with iceberg lettuce that could easily be improved by using romaine or something darker. My more culinary friend ordered the chicken soup and swears it is one of the best he has tasted. And this guy knows food. He is the type of person that has a hog slaughtered and knows what to do with the meat.\n\nSo it's a great place to go for chicken soup, and I heard the queso fundido is pretty darn good as well. Although it was recommended you order just the queso, and if you want chorizo, ask for it on the side because otherwise it gets a little greasy."}
{"input": "It was your average target experience.  The staff at this target were very nice.  Most of the staff I ran into greeted me with a smile and a \"Do you need help?\".  \n\nStore was clean and organized.  Parking was easy.\n\nI gave it 4 stars because the water selection was almost completely gone.  Shelves were nearly empty and selection was sorely lacking."}
{"input": "Food was good service was great. We all liked the beer variety, and the bourbon list is amazing. We started with pork cracklings and fried green tomatoes. You don't get many cracklings but they are really good. The tomatoes were actually cooked almost perfect a few were alittle dark but still delicious. I order smoked sausage, it was more like a spicy smoke sausage you buy at your local price chopper. Note this I thought I was ordering a sausage plate but I only got a bare plate full of sausage no sides no bread. My wife got the veggie burger and sweet pot fries, burger was so so fries were good. The couple with us said they liked there's so I cannot contest. The service and atmosphere is where it was at. Oh I did try some of my buddies pulled pork and it was really good, remembered now cause I wish I would have ordered it"}
{"input": "It is a real gem! I didn't appreciate how unique it was and regret driving by it for so many years. They have a great happy hour and a Deschutes beer selection to be proud of.  And most importantly, the food is really good. The subs are hearty and fresh.  Go for the 9\" Italian, and then afterwards order a sub."}
{"input": "A great place for breakfast - the parking situation is a little difficult with them only having a small area for cars. I don't live nearby so it's always a task to get a good space. The times I've gone early in the morning it has been a little hectic and crowded. I will say - the food is delicious. The coffee is better than most i.e. Starbucks, Duncan Donuts - it's a cut above the rest!"}
{"input": "Decor was  beautiful, food was absolutely spectacular. My server Lynn was a bit condescending and mispronounced a majority of the names of the dishes. I don't particularly like being treated like a child, but despite this I would happily come back to enjoy the food and atmosphere!"}
{"input": "Brandon Ravens was the best server. He made us feel so personalized, brought the drinks in literally less than 2 minutes. He is so easy going but knows how to be professional at his job. Islands is a great place to relax, have a drink and maybe a fry or 2. My 2 friends and I felt as if we were in heaven, we love it here. Will definitely be coming back and becoming regulars. We love the entire staff. 10 outta 10"}
{"input": "Great bbq. I love their mac and cheese,  as well as their other sides. The brisket is extremely tender,  and so is the pork. You also get free ice cream so that never hurts, lol."}
{"input": "Very kind people. I came in looking for some ginger tea due to some nausea I was experiencing. The attendant there immediately took sympathy on me and made me a good ginger tea. She didn't limit herself to that though. She also gave me a free ginger ale free of charge and wished me the best of luck in feeling better. She was quite motherly - very kind and nice. The ginger tea was also great. It's these kinds of experiencing that make me happy to support local businesses."}
{"input": "Destination of many a field trip in my youth and now a desirable destination when I return home to visit. While quiet and understated, this museum reflects the reverent spirit of the American Indian. While many pieces simply depict the American Indian, others were created by Native American Artists. \n\nOne of the most memorable pieces is a photograph of a horse galloping and all four hooves have left the ground. My soul reflects this feeling while sauntering the hallowed halls."}
{"input": "The miso soup was great, very flavorful. The portions were very big we ordered several rolls and definitely had leftovers. The tuna-tuna roll was good, the mango was a great flavor combined with the tuna and ponzu sauce. The spicy tuna crunch was great too. The waitstaff was fantastic, couldn't have been friendlier or more attentive. The rock shrimp tempura was bland, there wasn't enough flavor to the shrimp and not enough sauce but the presentation was beautiful. Everything was very fairly priced and I will definitely return."}
{"input": "Finding a place where I can take my daughter whose is gluten and dairy intolerant and a vegetarian and picky as hell is impossible. These guys make the impossible possible. She was thrilled and everything I ate was fantastic. For those non-vegetarian non-gluten free and non-dairy free you'll love it. \n\nI had biscuits and gravy with a side of pork sausage. You must try this. One of the best biscuits and gravy I have ever had. \n\nThe owners are a truly nice couple. Go out of your way to eat here. It's worth it."}
{"input": "Loved our family dinner here just before Christmas. It's a cozy space and the service is fantastic. I can see why it's hard to get a reservation!  Great draft list - it's rare to see Chimay plus a ton of local brews. The wine list was also fairly expansive. The drunken mussels were delicious - the broth was incredible and I appreciated the toast to soak it up! I had the crab stuffed salmon for an entree. The crust was great and the portion was the perfect size. The mashed potatoes and broccolini were a nice complement.  I wish I had more room for dessert! But the complimentary Limoncello shot at the end was a nice touch."}
{"input": "Naglaa is the best at eyebrow threading! She really listens to what you want and makes it happen. I enjoy keeping my eyebrows full with a nice arch and she delivers. Too many times have I been somewhere where they pluck my eyebrows into nothing. I know some women like that but not me. And Naglaa understands that. The threading is quick and she is so detailed. \n\nThe salon is so cute - and the staff is very warm. You are offered a beverage as soon as you walk in and every person that works there is welcoming."}
{"input": "Hands down the best Indian food in STL. Tried Indian restaurants all over the city, none of them even comes close to the authenticity of the taste that i experienced here.\n\nEach and every item on the buffet was outstanding, which makes it even more extraordinary considering buffet items general are bland and tasteless.\n\nKeep up the outstanding establishment, hope to come here more often"}
{"input": "I booked an appointment with Rebecca online -\nNot knowing what to expect when I arrived to this new salon. Everyone at Halo Hair was wonderful! The ladies who run the place are very warm. My haircut and color went great. Their prices are fair. Definitely coming back! Rebecca was very nice to talk to and work with."}
{"input": "You need a Cinnamon Roll from the bake house.  You probably need two; life would have just a little less happiness and light without their Cinnamon Rolls.\nThe coffee and salads are also excellent, a lovely Saturday morning breakfast treat."}
{"input": "Talk about a little slice of SERENITY IN THE CITY!!!! I saw this place prior to construction; to say it's been a major overhaul and all for the better is putting it mildly. \n\nFormer warehouse area, this transformation is a god-send.  A hidden gem, as you have to mount the 96 plus stairs, I counted, from the street to the park. \n\nGreat hidden gem. This park came from the ashes of the Phoenix. Former wharfs used to sit here, now the area has been transformed into an oasis of serenity. \n\nClimb the 96 or so stairs, I counted, to gain access to a little piece of earthly heaven in the form of breathtaking views of the city. Seems to be something straight from a postcard. \n\nWay to go CITY OF NOLA, job well done. \n\nThis park in the heart of the Marigny serves its purpose of promoting a day time get away."}
{"input": "My girlfriend and I decided to give this place a try. We got cornbeef special hoagies and fried pickles. Was very delicious and we will be ordering again for sure. Delivery was quick as well."}
{"input": "This is my favorite taco place in Tucson. It has delicious vegetarian options and the price is hard to beat. They have excellent salsa options and you get complimentary chips. The only issue is that parking is difficult to find, but that's expected with any restaurant in downtown."}
{"input": "Love this place. My favorite is their eggplant. Will definately go back again..great place to go with a group. You will need a reservation."}
{"input": "Don't go here during late night. Fast food resteraunts in the city love to not give a shit at 2:00am and not take your order even though their open 24/hrs. Terrible."}
{"input": "Pretty good bagels, be sure to ask for extra cream cheese if you like a lot. The people are always pleasant which is unique to Dunedin. The bad thing is the guy doesn't wash his hands or wear gloves. He took a previous customers money, my money,  used the phone and wiped his nose, then he made my bagel. I won't go back. If this doesn't bother you, the bagels are pretty good."}
{"input": "The best auto repair shop in the St. Louis area!. Our family has been using this shop for years and drive almost 20 minutes to get to this shop because we are ALWAYS pleased with their work. Gary and Joe (and the entire team) bring many years of experience. They are knowledgeable and honest. They will give you an estimate prior to any work be done on your vehicle. They also do not sell you unnecessary services like many chains and/or dealerships will attempt to sell you. I highly recommend this shop!"}
{"input": "Al's is located in ybor one block south of the busy 7th ave. I've passed by it so many times in the past but never realized it was a BBQ restaurant because every time I passed it previously, they've been closed. Also, the building just looks like a regular residential home when its not opened and packed with customers.  Last Friday, I made it to Al's around 8pm and they close at 9pm. Unfortunately, since it was late in the day some of the food items I wanted to order were sold out. In the end, I ordered the sausage and ribs platter with collared greens and okra, The food was so amazing and the staff was very helpful and friendly.  I will definitely be coming back very soon to try the other barbecue and side options."}
{"input": "I had the taco burger and it was amazing. I also highly recommend the veggie patty. Very fresh!"}
{"input": "Listen up, people!  Fall off the bone mushy ribs are not what you get at a proper barbeque joint!  If you want that stuff, then go elsewhere.  Smoked ribs are meant to be a little tough."}
{"input": "Casa Video is FANTASTIC for anything you want! I love this place. They appear to have new releases and all of that, but I love them for old stuff...DVDs of all the stuff I love from the 70s and 80s. Amazing staff, so cool."}
{"input": "So far the most amazing court house I have ever seen. Great for weddings, though beware there are tours going on, and it's open to the public. Probably the most beautiful building in Santa Barbara. If you can go to the tower, you can see the ocean, and a beautiful town. Love Santa Barbara."}
{"input": "This place is excellent. Best damn daiquiri I've had - and I'm not a rum fan usually and have a fiancé who is quite a cocktail maestro. Service is excellent and everyone was super pleasant. The staff were incredibly friendly and this was one of the warmest places I've been; unique from the other cocktail bars in hipster east nasty."}
{"input": "I asked for a manicure gel nail and this is what I get. The paint is so sloppy and  did not clean around my nail whatsoever . I had to paid $40 for this, never going back there."}
{"input": "Great cozy cafe for studying or meeting up with friends! Super well decorated and clean! Friendly staff! \nThe food and drinks are really yummy but I find it is overpriced for what you get."}
{"input": "I love the toastery!!!  We come here every week to eat breakfast. This place is huge and has such a nice vibe. Staff are very friendly and the prices are amazing. The food is very good quality and they have a huge variety from everything to vegan, gluten free and regular breakfast fare. This area needed another breakfast place. I don't want the toastery to close. I don't want to be forced to have to go to the same old breakfast places on the main line again. Get your butts to The famous toastery."}
{"input": "Not worth it. There are so many great restaurants in Nashville I wouldn't waste your time here. The best party about this place is their shine-grias (moonshine, margarita, and sangria) but besides that our brunch had 9 guests and everyone's food was bland. Not to mention they messed up or checks too. Nice manager but not a spot is return to."}
{"input": "The service was not bad, it did however have a line that went out the door. I suggest going here for your morning coffee and cookie fix."}
{"input": "Haven't eaten at Wendy's in a long time but these have really changed for the better. Fries with sea salt!  Really good quality for fast food. Normally I don't even rate fast food!!!"}
{"input": "Hendricks is a must try in St.Louis. The meats,sauces,and sides are better than most barbecue places.Onion rings are huge and the coleslaw is tasty and finely shredded. Service is good and very friendly. Takes awhile to get the meal,but it gives you time to check out the unique decor."}
{"input": "Meh is all I can say for TDS. The restaurant itself is just cold.... not literally, but figuratively. There was no decor, no menu boards, stainless steel prep tables as dining tables, no soda machines, staff EVERYWHERE with no identification (shirts, nametags, etc). The food is reasonably priced and most of it was quite good, but what really irked my party was the fact that they charge for extra salsa!!! We ordered a salsa trio (which included 3 samples of the various salsas, in 2oz glass prep bowls), and when my brother asked for more salsa for his tacos (mind you, we ordered one of ever taco, three burritos and guacamole), he was told he'd have to buy the trio again! Really!!??? We spent over $40 on food, drinks and apps, too. Even though the food was decent, I wouldn't return as the atmosphere is just blah and you can't get extra salsa for your damn tacos!"}
{"input": "This is my favorite thai restaurant in the St. Louis area. I love the feel of the place, the people who work there are always great, and the food is fantastic & very well priced."}
{"input": "I really like it at this bar. I wish I lived closer because it is a great bar to hang out with friends or even for a simple date night.\n\nThe beer is good and there is always a lot on tap as well as in bottles. There food is surprisingly good too. The french fries are killer shoestring fries, their mac and cheese is pretty good, and the fried green beans are great!\n\nI did not like the polenta fries, but the rest of the food made up for it.\n\nI would recommend getting a bunch of apps and splitting them, which is what I've done with friends."}
{"input": "We stopped into this restaurant due to its convenience to our tour bus pickup across the street.  The seating area was fairly large, including extra space upstairs (where we were).  This was great, because we only had to wait a couple minutes for a table.  We enjoyed the char-grilled oyster appetizer, but I thought it was missing \"something\".  Maybe a bit of pepper or other seasoning...\n\nI wasn't terribly hungry, so I just ordered a cup of gumbo.  It was decent but only had chicken and sausage inside, and I really thought it could use a bit of seafood to round out the flavor.  The kids liked their food off the kids menu pretty well, although they should offer a marinara sauce option for the noodles (my young daughter wasn't so excited about butter sauce on her noodles).  My wife had enjoyed what she ordered, although I can't remember what she ordered for the life of me!\n\nThis wouldn't be our first choice for New Orleans cuisine in the whole city, but it's a good short notice option."}
{"input": "Negative 5 stars. Worst service and slow, 15 minutes for 1 panini. They use microwaves people so its not even fresh, just crap. I'm sure they don't CLEAN them either. Disgusting, Get Real. I will go buy a frozen breakfast sandwhich & cook it my own CLEAN microwave which isn't cooked with everybody else's crap. NEVER AGAIN will go here. Btw i waited so long i got my money back. Keep your crappy sandwhich and enjoy"}
{"input": "Great food, great drinks, terribly (unapologetically so) service. It's not dick's last resort, it's not your shtick to be shitty... We had to ask for water four times and when we got it, it was luke warm.......annnnnd it wasn't busy.  like the vibe would consider coming back for drinks but would have to mentally prepare I was walking into a shit show."}
{"input": "Neat diner, unlike other diners as it's quaint and has a good feel to it. I had the Yankee pot roast....which was ok....mashed potatoes were just ok and the meat was kind of bland. The veggies were excellent, fresh, not out of a can.  My wife had an omelette which she said was good. Service was excellent."}
{"input": "Nothing makes my busy day easy like my iced coffee at Starbucks and this location botched it up for me:( see my photo yup those are coffee grinds at the bottom a whole bunch of coffee grinds:( yuck yuck!"}
{"input": "Eclipse Pizza has been our favorite pizza place for years. Try the Ironman Pizza and the carrot cake!"}
{"input": "I spent New Years Eve here, and it was truly the most memorable one I may have ever had. I live in NYC, but travel to New Orleans often for New Years and this year it was a total of 10 of us traveling. We had a table at Marche together and it was the most elegant, fun evening. We had perfect views the fireworks at midnight from the deck and all the windows. The food was exceptional (buffet and passed hors d'oeuvres) and the waitstaff all went above and beyond. Brandi, one of the waitresses is truly happy seeing others have a great time and felt our smiles were her reward - other major cities seeking solid waitstaff should clone her. This was Marche's first NYE party and I suspect this will be the hottest ticket in New Orleans in the upcoming years."}
{"input": "So delicious! I am so happy Reno is getting more variety in it's restaurants. \nBab Cafe has a great menu, service was quick even during the lunch rush. \nI had the Dak-Galbi Bibim-bab \"teriyaki chicken.\" The meat was tasty, veggies were fresh, sauces were awesome. I also ordered a side of potstickers (because I can never resist potstickers) and they were so great. \nOnly wish it were a little easier to get to, being downtown parking can be a challenge."}
{"input": "First time at Butcher & Bee with my husband who joined me and my co-workers for lunch one day. I love the place, it so cute with the farmhouse feel. It's really open and cute booths that offers some privacy. We had a group of 7 and it was a bit tight, but we were able to be sat right away. I ordered the pork belly gnocchi, and it was good, but not great. I felt it lacked texture. If the pork belly was crispy, it would have sealed the deal. My husband ordered the trout sandwich, unfortunately, he was disappointed that it was basically a 'tuna salad' sandwich. He did not enjoy it. For dessert, we ordered coconut macaroons, which were good. Co-workers had mixed reviews, but one ordered the KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) sandwich, and he liked it. Will definitely have to give this place another try. Also, the use books for bill holders, so cute!"}
{"input": "The burger blew my mind! I wanted to say \"Can I have another?\" but there was no way I could fit it in - this burger is not only delicious but it's huge. You definitely won't leave hungry but I do encourage you to try and squeeze in some duck fat fries...they are worth it! Also love the cocktail menu. I will certainly be returning."}
{"input": "Not so good teppanyaki. Not so bad, but the flavors just don't add up to much. The service seemed a bit disorganized. Mackeral sushi was dry."}
{"input": "I knew from the first bite of my fried spring roll that I would be back. It was that good. \n\nAlso had the pad thai with chicken (saw it recommended in a lot of Foursquare tips) and cleaned my plate. It was a smaller portion, so don't plan on having leftovers like you would at most Thai places. \n\nAs I mentioned, the fried spring rolls are amazing. Seriously. But you only get two. Do yourself a favor and get a double order. \n\nService was top knotch as well."}
{"input": "We went to The Depot last Saturday around 8:30 pm and most of the crowd was outside. We went straight for the bar and settled there. We (my husband and I) each had a beer flight which is my favorite way of exploring what the establishment has on tap. The place is really cool overall! If I had to point out something it would be the lightning, if far to bright to be a bar... But that's just me."}
{"input": "Place is on the edge of the French Quarter in more ways than one. But the coffee was good and a cool coffee shop."}
{"input": "This is best described as country chic at  it's best, it's old and probably needs a serious update, it has an old smell to it but clean and the staff is great BUT.... it has 2 restaurants on site with live music and a pool with cabanas indoors, to my surprise. It's an atrium style floor plan so everyone and anyone can see you at the pool. Be careful this hotel gets mixed up with the Gaylord hotel near by."}
{"input": "Wow ! We are from a \"foodie\" resort town in Michigan and were lucky to find a true foodie place here in St. Pete at Brick and Mortar. If you don't try this place only your palette will be disappointed. The wine list, the craft beers aren't even needed to compliment the food ! Never thought i would suggest a Burger and all i can say is PLEASE try it, simply the best, no condiments needed. \nWe had to come back again and order something a little more challenging and we were not disappointed...the meat, cheeses and pasta, then go for a dessert !!! Dang !! \nThis place has it happening, Creative, Fresh Food, Fish, the Veal Meatballs! from scratch and they treat you like family !! \na BIG YEEE HAAAAA all the way from Traverse City, Michigan !!!... just sayin..."}
{"input": "Ate here 3 times. 1st time was amazing second time was like eating leftovers third time they changed the menu and by menu I mean paper and marker... The new menu doesnt interest me at all. I just paid $22 before tip for glorified ramen noodles."}
{"input": "If you're in St. Louis, be sure to go to the Budweiser Brewery. Tours are free, informative and interesting. You get two tasting samples and the tour guides are very knowledgeable."}
{"input": "Thai Fusion is hands down the best Thai food I've ever had - and it's just right around the corner from my house! The service is excellent and the staff is incredibly friendly which definitely bumps them to the 5-star rating."}
{"input": "I really like these guys! I needed to get replacement keys made for my car since the existing ones were worn and not opening the doors consistently. I was referred by my mechanic, who said \"go see these guys. They'll take good care of you\". He was right!\n\nMy car has transponder keys that cost a mint if you get them from the dealership, or a lot less from eBay (always go eBay). While evaluating my key, they made a test copy before risking cutting on the blanks I brought them. I appreciated that caution. Even after cutting the keys, he checked that they both worked in all doors and the trunk before giving them to me. Very thorough job and great attitude. Highly recommended."}
{"input": "This place is pretty amazing with a novel idea. The pizza is great, the choices are vast. \n\nOnly suggestion: clean the walls, they are covered in dust and lint (look up)"}
{"input": "Totally blown away! This place is amazing! I thought it was going to be an average run-of-the-mill type of place - but I was so wrong. They make their sandwiches (which the quality of the meat is so good) on fresh-baked waffles. What a genius idea. It all turns out beautiful. I can't wait to try different things next time!!!!"}
{"input": "Always make a visit to a Delux when I'm in town.  The burgers are always amazing. The turkey celebrity burger is outstanding."}
{"input": "We loved this place! Very nice atmosphere, the live piano was a nice touch. The view is amazing, the dining room is practically over the water!! \n\nI recommend staring with the steamed mussels, the sauce it comes with is to die for! For our main course we both had the stuffed grouper which was also great. When most restaurants say crab stuffed something, they mean breading with a little crab. Not here, there was so much crab I don't know if there was any breading. And sooo good!! \n\nFor a side, get the Parmesan risotto also amazing!\n\nWe had such a good time we are sure to visit next time we are in town!"}
{"input": "The food is barely edible. Got goat biryani and goat curry. The Goat meat was tough and full of gristle. The biryani left a lot to be desired.  There are several places in Delaware that have far better tasting biryani.  Being a to go place service is non existant."}
{"input": "This is a standard Best Buy.\n\nThe staff in the games section was helpful and amiable.  Other than that it is mediocre on every level."}
{"input": "There's a few times in life you come across a gas station that really lives up to its expectations.  Well that would be UGas. Not only was it just as described, but the gas was beyond and over as described.  The store has plenty of snacks and drinks as well as oil and such.  There is also a carwash which I used.  Coming from Tx thru OK, well the old girl had picked up a lot of dust but she is squeaky clean now.  This is not a bad store and conveniently located near the highway.  If you are ever in the neighborhood, give it a try.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"input": "My bridesmaids booked this for my bachelorette party and it was so much fun!! We made really good friends with the other groups in our tour, played trivia, learned about Nashville's history, and got a little buzzed! Dave was an awesome tour guide, he's quirky and knowledgable and really opens up if you joke around with him :) plus he have me a bride cowboy hat with a veil and temporary tattoos for all of us which was a fun twist! Definitely a unique spin on day drinking!"}
{"input": "The theme of the resturant is a lot of fun with all of the prohibition photographs and other fun decor. The food and drinks were all pretty good but the one thing that would make me not come back to this restaurant are the overly high chairs and tables. My entire party had to literally climb up into the chairs and then you feel like you are jumping down when you had to get out of the chair. At one point one person in our party went to the restroom and came back and stood the rest of the time because they said it was too hard to get back into the high chair. These were handmade and the person who made them neglected to use proper height measurements for high top tables and chairs. They are a safety hazzard."}
{"input": "Been coming to Spice n Grill since 2012, we were fortunate to live in University city so was quick and easy to get here, now we live in Creve Coeur and I will most certainly make the drive back as have now tried numerous different Indian takeaways and this still comes out Trumps.\n\nTakeaway is always neat and clean, and the owner is always smiling and very friendly and always willing to explain any questions I have about the menu.  We have tried the chicken curry, chicken vindaloo, and goat Karahi and everything is always well cooked and perfectly spiced.  The goat here is the best I have had as every piece is always soft and tender and the sauce is amazing. And the rice is always hot and fluffy\n\nOnly negative I have to comment on, is the portion sizes are defintely getting smaller, i would like to see the bigger portion sizes that used to be served in 2012"}
{"input": "Even though I don't buy a huge amount of wood,   Curt treats me like I'm a five star GC.  Highly recommended.  Love the service."}
{"input": "Probably the worst haircut experience I've ever had. Trimmed my beard against my request and it came out very uneven. Took FOREVER. Workers were extremely inconsiderate. Definitely do not go here."}
{"input": "I believe Kelsey Crews photography to be the best photographer so I hired her again for my parents 50 the wedding anniversary! The pictures she took are priceless, I love how she can mix in with the party and catch the moments perfectly! Kelsey is a very lovely lady and I refer her to anyone who wants the best photography and very affordable too!\nThank you Kelsey for coming through for us again:)"}
{"input": "We took my father here for his 80th birthday.  We made a reservation for a party of 10, but they did not seem to have the reservation.  So, there was no table ready for us.  It was early, so there was no issue with getting a table... we just had to wait for it to be assembled.\n\nOther than that, we enjoyed the experience.  The waitress was attentive, and there was not a long wait for anything.  Also, she did not add an automatic gratuity to the bill, even though we were a large party.  There were no complaints about any of the food."}
{"input": "First visit tonight. Nice, clean place. Reasonably priced. Friendly staff. Excellent presentation of extremely bland, mediocre food. I ordered the chicken fajitas. Onions and pepper base (warm) on a tepid fajita platter. Meat, room temperature. Pico, cheese, sour cream, tortillas were nothing special. I was underwhelmed. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"input": "Love this place. Every time I'm in SB we eat here. Always fresh specials. Lots of fun!!!"}
{"input": "I fell upon this great little pub after a tour at ESP. What a find! Excellent food and interesting beers. The atmosphere was perfect. To the man at the table next to us (Saturday 12/28 about 2pm) with the blue sweater-if your date was not successful, PLEASE look me up!"}
{"input": "I know I shouldn't expect much but everything I asked for that was on the drive thru menu was not available. I was actually afraid of what I was going to get once I did get it. I saw the movie \"waiting\".  Word of advice stay clear of this arch. Just so you know I was only trying to order a beverage how pathetic is that."}
{"input": "This place is very busy. But the customer service is top notch. I love the fact that the servers are constantly checking on us. The steak here is DELICIOUS. One more Time for SERVICE."}
{"input": "Buddy Brew is the place to go for morning coffee and a delicious breakfast. Their toast totally blows my mind, it's the best toast I've had in a long time, possibly ever. Parking around 7:30 AM can be a challenge, though, b/c the lot gets very crowded."}
{"input": "It was our first time in Philly last October and the weather was nice enough to we wander from neighborhood to neighborhood. On the way back to the hotel we spied what looked like a pub at which to kill time before another restaurant opened.\n\nI was more than pleasantly surprised by the beer menu, and the \"snacks,\" including one of the best cheese plates I've ever tasted had us thinking we might have to cancel our other dinner reservations. To round out a meal, my wife had a fish dish with \"smushy peas\" and I had the sage/apple/pumpkin risotto.\n\nIt was also early enough in the day that we completely missed the most of the dinner/drinks after work crowd, so the atmosphere held up. We practically had the place to ourselves for a while. All in all it was the perfect place to stumble into."}
{"input": "Tarahumara replaced my favorite Cherokee Mexican restaurant, Siete Luminarias, so they had big shoes to fill.\n\nThe menu is small but excellent. The gorditas de harina are outstanding, the chillequiles rock, the salsa is house made and amazing. We haven't made our way through the menu yet, but everything so far has been great.\n\nThis is now our new favorite Cherokee Mexican restaurant. A great addition to the street."}
{"input": "Okay, so it's a dance club. It's trendy and offers higher-end cocktails and beers while still offering your run-of-the-mill wells and domestic bottles. On certain nights, guys have to pay a door charge (but that's not really uncommon in the industry). There is a huge patio and, even in the winter, almost the entire patio is still available because they enclose it. The music is pretty hit-or-miss...sometimes you're dancing away to classic hip-hop, pop, and even rock, and other times you're standing there while the DJ spins out an un-danceable tune. If you're on the patio, you can chat...but if you're inside it's (not shockingly) too loud to really talk. If you're in the CWE and you're looking to dance, at least give the Mandarin a shot; it's not going to be for everyone, but it's pretty great if you're in the mood for it."}
{"input": "Our Scene:\nIts a sunny, humid, middle of the week day in Tampa FL. Beth T and companion are sitting around doing nothing.\n\nMe (beth t): I'm bored. \nCompanion: Me too. Let's do something.\nMe: OK. What?\nCompanion: I dunno.\nMe (brilliant idea flashing): Let's try this sponge dock place in Tarpon Springs.\nCompanion: OK.\n\nAs they drove to the sponge docks located on Dodcanese blvd. they became hungry. The sponge shopping didn't help so they stopped in a little restaurant with mediterranean murals all over the walls. \n\nMe: This looks good, you like Greek food? \nCompanion: sure, why not \n\nOh the amazingly oily greek salad with potato salad underneath! Oh the pita and fresh hummus! Oh the perfectly spiced gyros with french fries! Oh the sweet sweet baklava! \n\nMe: Yum\nCompanion: Yeah\n\nEntirely satiated and satisified they moved on down Dodacense Blvd. to shop for more sponges - one can never have enough - \n\nAnd ........SCENE."}
{"input": "Drive from Fort Campbell, Ky to this place every other weekend .\nLove the place, many TVs to watch a game on, full bar , great Hookah, good Ma`sell ( molasses-hookah...), natural coal not the one that burn your throat, have it with some mint tea and you my friend on nice journey ..lol... would recommend  it to the new to hookah and to  the old timers."}
{"input": "I would say A-Ok for the Towneplace Suites.   Ok...but not the best Marriott we have stayed at.   The beds were comfortable.   Our room was cleaned well.   The breakfast could be a bit better.  One morning they ran out of spoons.   The bacon looked funny... almost like it wasn't real bacon.   They were constantly running around trying to replenish something it was eggs or sausage or milk.  It just seemed a bit disorganized.   We would choose another place to stay if we visit again.   I can't be really negative, but I can't highly recommend this place either.  This is a very conflicted review."}
{"input": "Been looking for a better breakfast place for awhile now - where the food is good and you don't wait an hour to get in. This place hit the spot on all fronts. It's quiet, and small - maybe 40 seater, with 12 of those seats outside. The menu isn't huge but that's okay. They make up for it by ensuring it's fresh, cooked to order and really tasty. We tried some regular menu standards - breakfast sandwich and a chicken fried steak - in both cases, got far more (quality-wise) than we were expecting. I'll be back to try the brunch specials, and the weekend dinner service looks pretty good, too."}
{"input": "Looking for the  best Italian food and grocery? This is the place to be.  It could be very crowded on weekend . The full parking lot and hundreds of customers   inside the store proved that how popular this place is. Regardless of the big crowd the service was fast. The employee were well trained and friendly.  They were on the top of their game. I love the prepared food area. This time we got 2 Mango Tandoori chicken drumsticks, a piece of italian stromboli  and couple piece of beef plus 2 root beer sum up around $10. We asked the food to be heated and it took less than 5 minutes. We had a delicious picnic in the park afterward.  This is the best Italian market in my book. I never got disappointed every time I came here."}
{"input": "Went for $5 Tuesday's and it was amazing. Located on the side of Washington Square Mall it has plenty of parking. $5 movie tickets, $5 popcorn and unlimited refills on your drinks. The theaters have really nice chairs that move and recline out, remind me of lazy boys. I'm from the west side and this was my first time going to a movie theater out east. So sketched out at first hence why I haven't tried one in the two years living out here due to a scare of bed bugs or something crazy, not the case. The place was super clean with really friendly staff. The only bummer is the assigned seating. Thankfully I got two together so my daughter and I would be next to each other. Once in there I had to kick a lady out of my seat, she was not happy. They have the letter of the row on the carpet outside the aisle and the seat numbers on the front of them lit up. Overall I was amazed and pleased with this location and will be returning next Tuesday for another watch."}
{"input": "Two stars for quick service, interior decor and glittery walls. The food was really bad. The sweet potato roll was good before I bit into a piece that almost broke my tooth. There's an extreme amount of sauce on every special roll. One roll (can't remember the name of it) was slathered in something that tasted like McDonald's Sweet N Sour sauce - totally killed the roll! Another special roll was covered in an overly sweet white sauce - totally killed the roll, again."}
{"input": "I moved to STL from Nashville, TN, where I had one hell of a hairdresser. It took me a while to find a hairdresser as well as the one I had in TN, but I found it at V Vegaz. I go to Jason. I have curly hair, but often wear it straight. If you have curly hair, and you are serious about a good cut, then you know how hard it is to find a hairdresser that knows curly hair. If so, Jason is your man. Great salon!! And if you work on The Loop, you get a 15% discount. Can't beat that!"}
{"input": "Food was very good I had the chicken sandwich which was great, however if your drinking here I hope you have time to wait since it takes FOREVER to get a drink. I mean like 30 min to just get a beer."}
{"input": "Update. The large, live turtle tank has been replaced with a colorful fish aquarium. I don't know what happened to the turtle. Still recommended. Highly."}
{"input": "Waited 27 minutes for three teas (no one else was in the store when we came in and ordered). NO tea is worth that long of a wait, especially in Chinatown."}
{"input": "Solid, but nothing ground breaking or innovative. People dress business casual, or so it seemed when we went. No need to stress too hard about it though. There was a wait, even though we had reserved and there was lot of space in the back. Very good Liver Pâté with the assorted cheeses and such. Dessert was lackluster. Overall, more in the positive than the negative"}
{"input": "Amazing hotel! It's atmosphere is top notch! Also great food and events. This is where the cool kids hang in New Orleans. The roof top pool is the place to be. \nEvents like too trill trivia and the moonshine taste POC cabaret series are always packed! \nMy fave drink is the Peter Rabbit and the fries with spicy aioli!"}
{"input": "Simple flavors and well prepared. Understaffed at lunch. Fried Dumplings good, not great but not  greasy. Pork buns really tasty, pork a bit tough. General Tsos chicken delicious. Broccoli room temperature. Rice was fluffy and hot. Unusual to like rice that much  There's a skilled cook back in the kitchen for sure. Overall good feeling in the dining room but only one server for three tables + takeout+ phone. I'll be back. Uneven but worthwhile."}
{"input": "I received a haircut from Taneaka today and I had a wonderful experience. As mentioned in some of the other reviews, it did takelonger than I expected but I appreciate the care that Taneaka and her instructor spent on my simple trim. I got one of the best haircuts I have ever had. And Taneaka was very pleasant and fun to talk to as well. I am definitely going back."}
{"input": "New Orleans use to be all about service. My wife and I were running a few minutes late because our 1 year old needed to be changed right as we left the house. Mr B's would not seat my father until we arrived. It is time for Mr B's to get with the times."}
{"input": "My favorite local go-to place for yummy grub.  Ants Pants has not disappointed me yet! Food is always delicious and price is good. Love, love their shoe string fries! Salads are fresh and sandwiches are fancy. I give it 4 stars because they do not accept credit cards; it is cash only and they do have an ATM machine."}
{"input": "This is a great place for some more atypical Indian dishes that most Indian restaurants offer. Sure they have your usual curry but they also have chaat and other more unique meals. Their beef ribs, chaat and (of course) chai drinks are delicious. Lots of great texture and rich flavor! \n\nIt's a hidden gem with a very fun ambiance. You get wrapped in a colorful and fun dining area full of murals and a ceiling popping with sun parasols. Highly recommend dining in. Staff was friendly and knowledgeable!"}
{"input": "So much to like about this place--the beautiful Mercer Building location, the spaciousness, the lovely, friendly baristas. But there are a couple of important cons for me. Biggest being, the music is constant and too loud, ruining everything you go to a coffee shop to do: read, work, reflect, or enjoy a good conversation. When I asked for it to be turned down, they told me they can't--it just plays at one level all the time, and the speakers  are everywhere so you can't get away from it. It sucks.\n\nSecondly, if you're a tea drinker, you're out of luck. They don't serve the tea in pots, but huge, sloppy individual filters--it makes your beverage totally ungainly, hard to drink and is really off putting.\n\nPros: gluten free goodies and yummy Italian sodas. I'd love to spend more time here, but the music usually drives me out after 10 minutes."}
{"input": "Super amazing homemade food. They renew the interior and kitchen and it's looks great! Honestly hands down best Mexican in philly. Tamalex is good BUT this place is another story. Top Mexican by far. Only downside is cash only. Enjoy."}
{"input": "I've been here3 times now. It's great. We had the same server the first two times, and she was amazing. I was a little disappointed the third time when we had another server, but she was just as amazing. It's really tough to find a place with consistency anymore, but this place rocks. The food is delicious. \n\nYou need to get here early. Early. If you sleep in a little late, be prepared to wait. Luckily, we've beat he crowd every time. There have been 5-15 people waiting for a seat each time we left."}
{"input": "I am very happy with the selection here and even happier with the service I received from Charlie."}
{"input": "This Chef only buys fried chicken from this place. My only Soul food spot, good & consistant. ALWAYS call ahead!"}
{"input": "I live downtown but have been making the trip to Makiman in the Northeast because the sushi is fresh and delicious and reasonably priced compared to every other place downtown, so you can imagine my excitement when I heard they were opening a spot in the city.  \n\nI love going here on Mondays for the all you can eat sushi.  It's a great deal and you definitely leave feeling like you got your money's worth.  Their rolls are also to die for.  The yellow stallion and ne viking are two of my favorites.  \n\nIf you're looking for great sushi at a reasonable price with great service I would definitely stop in here!"}
{"input": "Decent lunch special. I really liked the veggies in the Kung Pow Chicken and it's got just enough spice (if you like spicy that is). Came in shortly after the lunch hour, they immediately started making my order and it was done probably 10 minutes later. I'll probably give it another try cause it was decent food... Maybe next time they can explain to me what the gluten free sign means, cause the gentleman who took my order sure didn't."}
{"input": "I guess a quaint neighborhood bakery that has been around for over 40 years! They are known for their delicious Doberge, Cannoli and King Cakes during Mardi Gras! \ndelicious"}
{"input": "Let's be serious.  This is Nashville--there ain't no good Chinese food to be found in this town, particularly for this former New Yorker who practically lived off the stuff until moving to town in June.\n\nThat being said, China Spring is probably the best Chinese food I've found in Nashville so far.  The food is always hot and fresh, the portions are generous, and the prices are more than fair.  I usually order steamed chicken and vegetables with brown sauce and brown rice, which is consistently good (though not difficult to mess up).  My boyfriend likes the chicken mai fun and the wonton soup.  I love that they're close to where we live and open late into the evenings for a quick stop after an evening meeting.  Until we find something better, which probably won't be for a long while, I'll continue to head to China Spring when looking for decent Chinese food."}
{"input": "Had the Mexican Roll and Philadelphia Roll for take-out. Very disappointed with the portion size of the rolls. There was nothing special with the taste and overall bland."}
{"input": "Melllew atmosphere, 16+ seats at bar, less than 10 tables, damn near best salmon skin in Reno/Sparks - no one can eat only one, everything  tasted fresh, right amount of rice 0n rolls and nigiri, price was right was well, great value for cost. South Reno's best hands down"}
{"input": "I'm really very impressed with the selection here. I'm not nearly as impressed with the price, but where else can you get such a huge selection of foreign beer? There's not just your usual Belgians and Germans either. I was happy to find Japanese, Russian and even some Lithuanian and Polish bottles to choose from. There are even some Quebec based brews you can find here (Du de Ciel sticks out) that I haven't found elsewhere in the Philly area.\n\nI'll be back just for the selection alone. You won't find anywhere with more inventory in the surrounding areas. I'll cringe when I see the high price but try to remind myself it's worth it."}
{"input": "I've always loved Gray Brothers. Their food is really, really good. Especially when you need/want comfort food. My #1 favorite is the chicken and noodles - and for those who won't eat the entire (quite generous) portion - you might not know that they offer a small portion for the main course. My most recent trip I got fried shrimp (which were delicious) and a pumpkin roll that melts in your mouth. My only issue with the place is that it is SO dark and dreary in there. I recently heard they'd done a renovation and the only thing I could see that had been done was that there was a new \"country store\" that  was added to the middle of the dining area. Meh."}
{"input": "It was my first time at this location but they are all pretty well the same. I usually go to a P.F. Chang's about once a year and each year it seems to get a little less impressive. Don't get me wrong the food is good but I am not really sure it's worth the price. We had the sesame chicken and lo mein this time around. The lo mein was really good but the sesame chicken was ok. I can get equal quality lo mein at a hole in the wall I know. Again it's not bad and the service was good."}
{"input": "This place is a vegetarian's dream! Food is great and their portion sizes are large. Although it is slightly over-priced, I highly recommend it (for meat-eaters too!). My personal favorite is the Crispy Ranch Chikn. I get it every time!"}
{"input": "I wish I had read the other reviews before setting this up for my friend.  Bottom line, she caught her plane, but very stressed.  Like other reviews, they scheduled the pickup 15 minutes later than requested, then arrived another 15 minutes after that. At another pick-up they couldn't find the passenger. In all 40 minutes late.  Given their history of such problems without improvement, this is simply no good."}
{"input": "Quick 24hr effificent locksmith. Charlie was our tech and he was very fast and understanding. The work was done well and quickly. Not the cheapest but we didn't mind paying for same day quick excellent service. We couldn't be more pleased."}
{"input": "The best cheese steaks around! Such nice and friendly staff don't think I have ever had any issues"}
{"input": "Great food. Terrible customer service. I've been three times and I've had two different older waitresses. Not pleasant to deal with whatsoever. The owner on the other hand is lovely."}
{"input": "Taking over in the spot of the original Benton Park  Cafe is Cafe Piazza.  The atmosphere is really nice and super ST. LOUIS.  The mural on the ceiling is a very eclectic work of art. Ask them how they did it and look under the bar. Great food. Different from your standard breakfast food.  Kinda fancy, but not intimidating.  I would highly recommend this restaurant for three reasons: decor, location, and good, creative food for the price."}
{"input": "Amazing and comfortable atmosphere with extremely unique flavor combinations in the dishes. The Cuban Lamb Frita is a must (add the egg! It's worth it). All of the side items are delicious, you literally can't go wrong. The staff is friendly and they are extremely efficient with the coffee refills. This has quickly become my new regular brunch spot!"}
{"input": "The best place for oysters. Go during the daily happy hour between 3 to 6pm. The oyster is 75 cents with a size of an egg and the drinks are 50% off."}
{"input": "I went here again last week and it does not disappoint. Please try the shrimp and grits if you go,  I promise you won't be disappointed!"}
{"input": "This was the first time we've been to this location and it is pretty cool. They have plenty of area to sit and relax and of course the coffee and food selection is on point."}
{"input": "A great restaurant to take people visiting from out of town. Very popular for breakfast/brunch on the weekends. Should expect to wait at least an hour any time after 9:30 AM and service takes a little while. But great menu options and delicious food. Also a great bakery, coffee and gelato counter that offers instant service or items to enjoy while waiting to get called."}
{"input": "I think I've come in to petsmart for two things, litter box and cat collars. AND I ended up having to get a different litter box and different cat collars later anyway. I really think petsmart is one of those places that's worth it if you go when they have sales or you need some sort of obscure thing, they have a huge selection. But I'm not the type of pet lover to pamper my pets and buy them stupid toys and rhinestone collars, when my cats prefer crumpled up balls of paper to fancy feathers and sequins. \n\nI have to say I'm sort of shocked by their natural and alternative food section. \nFYI they are almost always sold of out of flea stuff, especially when they go on sale."}
{"input": "Monthly lunch with my fellow colleagues the other day and the person assigned to get lunch ordered from Fresh and had it delivered. \n\nMy selection was the Chopped Italian salad. The salad consists of mixed greens, salami, smoked turkey, tomato, garbanzo beans and parmesan cheese served with the house vinaigrette. The salad was lacking for me. I think such a salad would be so much better with a few more Italian-esque ingredients in it, perhaps a little more anitpasto like. I know, it's not advertised as antipasto but c'mon....this salad was boring.  Throw in a couple of olives, some artichoke hearts, some sliced pepperoncinis. Maybe my tastebuds were having an off day but the salami wasn't very flavorful either. Charge a couple dollars more for a more inventive salad. Please!\n\nI do want to give them another chance since so many reviews on here are glowing. Maybe I need to stick with a panini or something but I really do love salads for summer lunches."}
{"input": "Update after initial review:  ordered again last night using the yelp eat24 app. Food was ready within 10 minutes of placing the order. I opted for pickup since I was on my way home. The app did not give them my correct phone # and speaking to the great staff at the reception desk they told me sometimes yelp gets the addresses wrong for delivery so my advice is to type your phone # and address (if using delivery) into the comments box just so you get your food as fast as they intend to get it to you. \n\nThis is the best place for sushi in the area. We have frequented other sushi places and this one by far stands above the rest. Was happy to see Saturday night was very busy for them, and my takeout was still ready in under 10 minutes!!"}
{"input": "Really great experience overall.  I imagine the experience varies based on your captain/tour guide. Our captain was named Troy and he was very knowledgeable and friendly. Would happily return with other guests to get another guided trip with Troy."}
{"input": "Ok, so they have good food and some really great coffee. And sometimes you get to sit on the sofa and it makes you feel like you're at Central Perk. But the place is filthy. Everywhere. I don't think they have ever swept the floors. Ever. Makes you wonder how clean the coffee making machines and utensils are too. Just saying."}
{"input": "I love Molldeli's. Their Famous Philly is really good as is everything else. My vegetarian friends have no problem finding something eat (neither do \"meat eaters\" such as myself). Sure, it's not cheap - but I'm willing to spend a little more to eat local."}
{"input": "Fantastic service! As a woman I'm usually nervous going in car places because I'm afraid I'll seem like a ditz. The staff here listened to me, helped change my headlights, and even taught me how to do it myself for the future. Just moved to the city from Tennessee and it's so nice to meet such nice folks. I know where I'll be going for any car stuff from now on!"}
{"input": "My first time at Cracker Barrel, and I really liked it. The food was good, and I could not believe how inexpensive it was.  Our waitress was very sweet and attentive"}
{"input": "Great drinks and a warm intimate atmosphere. Sat at the bar and chatted with the bartender and owner. They have some great spirits and good bourbons and whiskeys - all of the Pappys. Good strong drink with some great ingredients. Will definitely be back."}
{"input": "There's a certain kind of pizza that brings back the special memories of growing up in NJ--when pizza was a special family meal. Dominic's continues to fit the bill with what I think is the best NY-style pizza in Pinellas County. I recommend the standard cheese pie--you can't beat the simplicity or the taste.\n\nAnd while I didn't partake on my most recent visit, I also highly recommend the garlic knots. You just can go wrong with real butter and fresh garlic."}
{"input": "Change the name of this place to \"$12 a night just to park at this dump\" and maybe there is a chance at more than one star because I never made it past the less than persuasive garage attendant. It is trashy but common to charge customers park if you are located downtown or adjacent to the airport. This place is neither and has no excuse. It is located at the corner of bad neighborhood and interstate noise."}
{"input": "Fantastic! My favorite way to start a vacation in a new city. Bring cash, because you will WANT to tip the guide well by the end."}
{"input": "My husband had the 6 oz pepperloin meal and was very happy with it. I had the shrimp kabob meal. There were only 4 shrimp and they were more then well done and very small.  The service was good. The restaurant was not busy."}
{"input": "Horrible customer service for overpriced drinks. My bartender(Terry, yeah-- don't go to him) overcharged my credit card without permission. I called management several times trying to get refunded for the difference, but they never did even though the manager personally told me on the phone that he had issued me a refund. Make sure you monitor your credit card statement closely when you go there. Or better yet, use cash and find another lounge. I don't post reviews on yelp, but for this one -- I had to. Bad morale is just despicable."}
{"input": "Made reservation a over a week ago with request to be near band. On arrival they had no record of it. And we are stuck in the back next to the bathroom. 5 stars for cocktail,food, band and Atmosphere. 1 stars for utter lack of organization.  The woman who took it said she was new. Always call to confirm I guess. Completely disappointed esp since we've had such amazing experiences here in the past.  There open tables near front and were told they were for people with reservations"}
{"input": "i always get the buffalo pizza here, ive tried buffalo chicken pizza at alot of other places, and this is the only one i like. good prices too!"}
{"input": "Attended a party there. They now have a private room with your own bar and bathroom. I really enjoyed it. The buffet was good, didn't have to wait for a drink and you were able to hear each other talk. I would have a party there!"}
{"input": "This place is an amazing authentic Mexican restaurant. The atmosphere is more upscale compared to other Mexican restaurants, but the prices are the same. All of the food tastes fresh. Best salsa around. The ceviche is amazing and fresh, not fishy at all. The best thing I can recommend is the Organic Margarita! Best margarita I have had in my life. They don't use any mix. Highly recommend this place if you want authentic fresh Mexican cuisine!"}
{"input": "Expert bartenders here!\nWent during happy hour. (3-6pm, every day)\n50 cent oysters, half price cocktails, beer, wine.\nOysters come with horseradish, cocktail sauce, and this red wine sauce that is amazing. \nBest sauzerac in all of New Orleans.\nI've had a better Mint Julep.\nLike champagne?\nTry the French 75.\nHave an affinity for basil?\nThe Riverbend was delicious."}
{"input": "A friend and I went in for brunch this morning and it was absolutely amazing. We split a breakfast pizza and the B.E.L.T. sandwich and could have licked our plates when we were done. The staff was very attentive and friendly and recommended their sunrise mimosa - I had 4! Overall wonderful atmosphere, I definitely recommend and I will definitely be back."}
{"input": "The Barrio IPA is awesome! Paired with beer sponges and you have a great treat!  A+"}
{"input": "DISMAL. 1st medium rare steak was cooked so much it was shoeleather. Brown all the way through. The manager John offered to colk another himself. Atfer 15 mins a RARE steak xame out. John then made excuses and asked if I wanted a cupcake.. saying \"At least I know they are good.\" Avoid at all costs until a real chef is working there."}
{"input": "Let me start by saying the oysters are wonderful.  The rest of our meal, not so much.  Our second dish was the Pate of Louisiana Rabbit and Chicken Livers.  Flavor was nice but it was served icy cold, so the true  flavor could not come through.  The compotes served with the pate were wonderful, a great compliment.  Our entrees were the Steak and Frites and the Braised Lamb with Fresh Herbed Pasta.  The steak was perfectly cooked and well seasoned, the fries were limp and greasy.  The herbed pasta dish was interesting but there were only two tiny pieces of lamb, must have been less than 2 oz of meat in this dish.  Our total bill, with a $40 bottle of wine and two cocktails was over $170.  Poor value for inconsistent food.\nPlease note that our server, Chi, was knowledgeable, efficient and delightful."}
{"input": "This place is off the hook! One of the only places in the world where it's cool for a man to order a wine cooler. Little necks, Cesar salad, beef fat fries, baked chicken were all amazing. Must check this place out!"}
{"input": "We did the Cemetery tour with Michael, he did an excellent job keeping us excited and informed.  His passion for the city is contagious and his speech in front of the Plessy tomb was the highlight of the tour.\n\nWe took a second tour (Haunted 5 in 1) with Brian.  He was awesome, super energetic and told us some amazing ghost stories at the Andrew Jackson hotel."}
{"input": "uhhhh the waitress was quite not so nice when i asked for to build my own sandwich with just veggies. i wish she would've known more about the vegan options but apparently she didn't have time and was quite rushed."}
{"input": "Let me be frank and say I am a universal Schlafly fan. I like the Schlafly family, their products, each restaurant, and their presence in the St. Louis community. This review is based on several experiences. \n\nBottleworks: Great beer and a nice atmosphere. You can bring your entire family, a group to watch the game or have a quiet date night spot. Food is of great quality and nice quantity. \n\nWaitstaff are some of the best in the City. I have never ever been disappointed with a server, manager, buser or host. One time a buser overheard my dad talking about a particular beer that was no longer on tap for the season. My dad was bummed because he had just discovered it and wasn't able to find it anymore. 15 minutes later the young man dropped off a mini-pint at our table and told us he had looked and found a tiny reserve in the back. Super impressive and wayyy beyond the call of duty."}
{"input": "What makes Barrio stand out to me is the large open space and the shuffleboard (its my favorite bar game!). This is also a good location to watch the games - lots of TVs, good beer and great happy hour prices."}
{"input": "The best way I can summarize Capogiro is that it's a great luxury dessert. Small portions with phenomenal taste. You don't eat Capogiro's for sustenance or to fill up, you eat it simply to enjoy the taste. \n\nI think Capogiro's real strength is that it manages to create great texture without compromising the integrity of flavor. \n\nThat said, my absolute favorite is the pomelo/grapefruit. Very sweet and tangy without tasting artificial at all."}
{"input": "The reviews are true. All of them. Depending on what irks you, you'll love this place or leave pissed off and possibly disgusted. I love baseball and have been coming here since I was a kid so I'm probably a bit bias."}
{"input": "Got into Santa Barbara and went here for some drinks. Was a little disappointed they close so early, so we didn't get a chance to order any flights of beer or wine but did get to have beer from the bottle which wasn't bad. Would love to come back here earlier in time to taste everything else on their menu"}
{"input": "One of my favorite places to come to on a warm evening. The food is delicious, drinks are far from weak and the staff are some of the friendliest I've ever encountered. As I already said, I prefer sitting outside (good for people watching), however love sitting in the pub area as well. Looking forward to visiting again this summer!!"}
{"input": "Ordered large tossed salad with grilled chicken to go. One of the worst i ever tried. Salad mix from the bag, not fresh at all. And few small pieces of chicken. Doesn't worth $7,90 at all."}
{"input": "I came on Saturday in the afternoon and enjoyed my time there. The staff was friendly and willing to chat with you. They have a decent draft and bottle list. I ordered the Dante Piccante burger and it was spicy, but delicious! I will come back for a bite and beer!"}
{"input": "The staff is wonderful, the coffee is great, and the concept is different. An Indonesian cafe right in the heart of fishtown!"}
{"input": "I eat lunch here 1 to 2 times a week and have very good consistency in the quality of the food and service. They really do offer fresh food items and breads, oh your sweet tooth can also be satisfied with their pastries! I only do the pastries on the weekends as one of my coworkers has told me that calories don't count on the weekends!"}
{"input": "My pizza was so good I forgot to take a picture. This is my new favorite pizza place. Ironically, this location has been two or three other pizza restaurants that previously failed. So far, Snap is getting it right. I ordered a Sweet & Slow pizza and did a custom pie with shredded cheese, bacon, chicken, and fresh basil. The flavor was pure amazingness. I know that's not a real world, but that's how I would describe it. I wanted to go back the next day, but contained myself. My only issues with Snap right now are they don't make larger pies and they overcharged me. Granted it was only .50, but if your custom and signature pies have posted prices, you have to charge the customer those prices. Other than that, I will be back to try more. I highly recommend them."}
{"input": "My girlfriend took me there for my birthday dinner, and it was incredible! Daniel P was our server and he was awesome! Very knowledgeable and personable, the food was amazing and so was the ambiance! We will def be back!"}
{"input": "Loved the Mediterranean Grilled Cheese sandwich! Nice casual atmosphere. On the end of the strip so it is very convenient to get to during lunch hour. Looking forward to trying something else on the menu."}
{"input": "Always a morning person, and not a fan of Starbucks breakfast,  and you are walking at 8 am on Broadway St. with everything closed,  it was to my happy surprise, a 24 hour diner!  This is no Waffle House, this is worthy of being in the mix of Nashville's restaurants.  Bacon is premier, eggs are worthy of small farm quality, and the toast...THE TOAST!  actually got a second order because of how good they were.   The potatoes that came with had some sweet potatoes mixed in to just make you smile. \nYou can't miss the restaurant with the big picture window of the SUN flashing neon sign, right next to the Johnny Cash museum.  Limited menu, but what they do,  they do excellent.  Watched the million dollar come out,  and the other items,  and I would not have picked wrong on any item. \nYes,  a little higher priced,  but it was excellent,  and I am full!"}
{"input": "This is my first time coming to this establishment I was very impressed with the people the cooks the cashier, customers ,everyone was just very nice and just a really good feel of the place felt like home. I purchased a volcano Burger it was excellent. Sweet potato fries were done just right. And a black and white shake that was so thick and creamy I wanted to go get another one. Very impressed with this place I will be back"}
{"input": "Awesome service and food.  Served with a dry ice fog thing that add a layer of coolness to the whole experience."}
{"input": "So I've done takeout from here twice. The first time I did the baked pork chop with rice, and was not excited. It was undoubtedly good, but not really what I was after. The crazy part is that I was eating leftovers for two days after - which was impressive. \n\nThe second takeout order (last night) was excellent. It was water spinach, mango shrimp, and the seafood with vermicelli noodles and curry. The curry was very light, but the seafood was abundant and the mango shrimp was amazing. They also threw in a soup unsure of what it was (pork, corn, carrots) that was really tasty. Again - the leftovers from this order lastest for another two meals. \n\nI think I've found my go-to chinese takeout."}
{"input": "Very, very happy I tried this wonderful cantina. It seems they have a new chef and my first meal here was amazing. If you are a connoisseur of Mexican cuisine please try this place. I had veggie enchiladas w green sauce and it was flavorful and complex and not watery like most other Mexican veggie  dishes around town.   Im so impressed and happy to find this gem. My partner had  chicken enchiladas with red sauce and refried beans.  The red sauce reminded me of the sauce an immigrant woman I worked with used to make for potlucks.  I know I am shamelessly gushing but if you read my other reviews then you will know that it's not typical. The bartender Iris is very helpful and was a great server. Also one more thing, I want to mention the spicy margarita. It is now my new favorite drink in town. It has cilantro jalapeño and (I believe) cucumber and it is amazing."}
{"input": "I got the hot shave and it did not disappoint. They do 6 towels and a facial massage with oils in between. Great shave, great environment."}
{"input": "Açaí bowl is big, topped with fruit and granola.  I bought several ginger shots which were in the cutest bottles, perfect for the beach.  I will definitely return to this location when I'm in the area again."}
{"input": "Great place. Started coming about a month ago prior to Lightning game. Has become my go to place. The food is excellent. Being new it's not really that busy early in the week but I like that. Great tunes on sound system. Great bartenders ( Jenifer, Ryan, Josh )"}
{"input": "Service was great. I had the scallops grilled with a crab cake appetizer. My meal was very good. My wife had the shrimp tacos which she says were also very good.  Side dishes were good and seasoned well."}
{"input": "This is a somewhat large TJ Maxx, but by no means as large as the HomeGoods/TJ Maxx in Brentwood. This location has some higher end items that you won't find in the Antioch or 100 Oaks locations, but it doesn't seem the have great deals as the Brentwood one. This location seems to always be a mess, items strung about across the store. This isn't a bad TJ Maxx, but I prefer the location in Brentwood over this one."}
{"input": "Not a great experience at this place. It's pretty basic Americanized sushi. A lot of people like that, I don't. The fish wasn't very fresh, not good quality and not cut properly. If you get something with \"crunchies\" or lots of sauce, then you'd probably like it here."}
{"input": "If I were to visit the Philly area (even though it's about 30 minutes away) again I'd stay here.\n\nIt was clean, bright, and very well maintained. My bill was around $133 for a suite on a Friday night. \n\nI left early in the morning so I skipped the complimentary breakfast."}
{"input": "terrible food and the manager was shockingly rude when I tried to return my food. I had the frogs legs and they were rubbery and tasted awful. I was disgusted by her behavior and she should be ashamed of herself. I have never been treated more horribly by someone."}
{"input": "Very southern, very heavy. It was on TV so I take my touristy friends sometimes but I never really come here."}
{"input": "In my experience, the staff was a disappointment. We had 3 employees try to take our \"complicated\" order. We just wanted baked salmon with Avocado and cucumber. Which was just a simple customized order. While we were ordering our waitress didn't have the power to take our order. She felt it was to complicated so she just walked away and pass us up to another waitress. In result this restaurant lacks communication and mannerisms. So I wouldn't recommend this place. If your order is to complicated to them, they won't take it. they'll just pass you up to their manager."}
{"input": "For some reason this place makes me feel like I am on the set of the Wonder Years every time I eat there. The décor is busy and outdated and the food is damn good! It is a quick soulful lunch that you can finish for under $10 and in less than an hour. Always a good range of characters from businessmen, quarter workers, and tourist who aren't corny and want a decent cheap meal. You won't be ripped off here and the food will stick to your ribs and soak up your current or ever-looming hangover."}
{"input": "Customer service is a huge deal to me.  The manager was very receptive to my comment; that always means a lot to me when managers try to keep their patrons happy.  I can take comfort in knowing that I'm going somewhere where staff are always working on making patrons happy."}
{"input": "Quality sushi and such great eclectic decor make for a very nice dinner experience.  Beatles music plays constantly, and between the modern oriental wall decor are pictures of John Lennon everywhere.  My date and I ordered the Love Boat for two.  There was enough sushi and sashimi to stuff us both to the gills.  The miso soup is very flavorful; a far cry from many bland misos I have had.  I would recommend with the warning that it is pricy compared to other sushi restaurants."}
{"input": "Definitely should have read the reviews first.   Ordered $100 worth of pizza for a 13 year Olds birthday.  Gave then 2 hours notice.  The pizza still showed up an hour late, cold and tasteless.  Absolutely awful.    Never again."}
{"input": "We recently moved from Brooklyn, NY and have been in search of some really good pizza...and here it is! We were so happy to bite into a thin crispy crust! It was awesome, the service was amazing and we couldn't be more pleased. I highly recommend this place if you love great pizza and excellent customer service! They will surely get our business again and again."}
{"input": "I attended PMA's Risk Management Professional prep course and simply put... It was excellent.  Between the outstanding instructor Karl Cheney and PMA's tools on their website, I was able to pass on my first attempt. I would recommend this course to anyone preparing for any PMI Certification."}
{"input": "Just an average bagel place. My breakfast sandwich hit the spot (bacon egg and cheese on a blueberry bagel), but my boyfriend's hash brown was mushy. Service was average and the line was confusing for someone who has never been here before. The line starts to the right of the counter. You order, you then make your way around to the left to pay.... if the staff ever takes your payment. It's almost as if they don't want you to pay, because every customer literally had to ask the staff to take their payment."}
{"input": "Don't book a reservation on yelp! They'll trip over you to please you when you arrive!  Overkill at least 5 waitstaff interrupted us all evening to the point of annoyance.  And yet they jammed our party of 5 adults in the last possible table in the back room right next to a family with small children in an otherwise empty dining room.  \n\nBruschetta and salad great.  Food plentiful.  Wished they cooked the pizza a little longer. Very crowded tables. Jammed bar side. Complimentary Limoncello mini dessert shots were a surprise. \n\nFyi...Happy hour applies to bar and outside only."}
{"input": "I love this place! This past summer, I would go here almost every other day to buy a different kind of donut for my family to try. The atmosphere is great, service is great, and the food is amazing. Not only are their donuts tasty as heck, but their sliders are to die for as well. If you are a donut fan or just a sweet-tooth, you got to try this place. NOTE: The food truck that you might see around town, IMO, does not have the same quality. Go to the location on Magazine St."}
{"input": "Wow!   Soooo full!    Great staff!   Delicious food!   BYOB!   Good times!      I loved the wings, tofu, and the catfish!     I can't wait until I'm back in town to visit.    It's slowly becoming my undisputed go to restaurant when I'm philly!   Also heard from a patron that Uber eats started delivering.    Wish I lived closer so I could enjoy more frequently.    Absolutely one of my favorite spots for a good meal!"}
{"input": "I really enjoyed the feeling while having my coffee at La Va Cafe with my boyfriend. It was really peaceful. I liked the decoration too. \nThe macchiato and Danish that I had were good but not incredible."}
{"input": "The food here is delicious and the portions are amazing for the price.  The girl who works behind the counter is an absolute sweetheart.  Always smiling and happy.   I wish I worked closer so I could come more often."}
{"input": "Our room was fine (clean, no more or less than we expected), but honestly, never, ever again, and this is NOT the fault of La Quinta.  The parking lot had several cars with people living in them, as well as the lot next door (I think it was a Home Depot).  I did not feel safe outside of the hotel - while I typically don't mind walking a dog or two by myself during daylight hours, I was extremely uncomfortable with the area.  We had planned to stay there on our way back from our trip as well, but we opted to stay a few miles east in Greenfield at a very quiet, clean, new Holiday Inn Express that didn't have this issue."}
{"input": "I have been here several times over the past 6 months. The food is very good and so is the service"}
{"input": "I loved the atmosphere here. It was quiet, but not too quiet. The waiters and waitresses made casual conversation, but still checked to see that the customers were satisfied. It's a small place, but there seems to be plenty of room. Everyone that worked there was friendly and happy to help. The food was also delicious. I had the Crabby Wife, which I'd definitely recommend (with fried eggs) while my boyfriend had the chicken & waffles (get it with hot-sauce, syrup, and the sauce they provide you - it was fantastic!). Overall, it was great."}
{"input": "If you are willing to walk 3-4 blocks on the other side of canal... You will not be disappointed! Best place to eat so far!! Highly recommend!!  My husband and I enjoyed it so much that during a 5 day stay, we ate there twice!  Inexpensive dinner- total bill (for 2 people) minus alcohol $50."}
{"input": "This place is in a great and fun location and you can't beat the beautiful beachfront view. It's family friendly and has a surprisingly tasty array of scrumptious food and drink. The burgers are my fave and they also have excellent sandwiches, onion rings and shakes. \nAdd to that a nice selection of cold beer and all at reasonable prices. Oh yes, the employees are always quite nice. If you are in the area and hunger strikes I recommended giving the Beach Grill a try."}
{"input": "Very good hole in the wall. Got some chili fries here with my girlfriend. They were great and the service was awesome."}
{"input": "While the food and service are excellent (loved the chicken pad thai, mango rice + a very friendly & humorous waitress), the parking & location was a total nightmare. The restaurant is often overcrowded (the size of the restaurant is small) and waits can be an issue. Also, they leave the front door open, which allows cold air to fill the restaurant. Basically, once inside, it's easy to feel claustrophobic and chilly. \n\nOverall, the location isn't good at all. I'm sure college students love it close to their respective campuses, but it has a negative effect on the restaurant's ambiance and culture. \n\nHowever, the experience (once inside) is appreciable. A four-star rating if not for sub-par external criteria."}
{"input": "I LOVE this place!  The service is good, the food is very fresh, mostly organic and/or locally grown and reasonably priced.  I've had the grits, bacon, eggs, biscuits, fruit salad with whipped cream, cornbread........and it is all delicious.  This is one of the best brunch places in the city.\n\nIn addition to great food the service is also very good.  They are attentive without being intrusive.  The only con is that the location is small, which makes for long waits on the weekend for brunch.  Here's a tip - If you arrive after 1:30/2pm on Sunday....you will be seated right away.\n\nEnjoy!"}
{"input": "We had New Year's Eve dinner at Lüke. Two of our party of three ordered the 4-course set menu.  The waiter skipped the second course entirely, and then said it wasn't a course at all when we pointed this out.  We sought clarification and the waiter was indeed wrong and did not understand the set menu.  Another waiter stepped in, offered to serve the second course after the third, and to give us complimentary champagne, more wine, money off our check, and extra food.  \n\nThe solution was not ideal - the order of dishes was off, we did not really want the extras, and the \"champagne\" was horrid, but it was New Year's Eve and we wanted a pleasant evening, so said fine.  Most of the dishes were excellent. However, our final tab did not show the promised deduction.  \n\nOverall, a bit of a disappointment."}
{"input": "The decor may be old, but every thing on the menu is great! Definitely a place when you want to fill up, and have a good time with friends."}
{"input": "I've now been to Margaritaville in Nashville and the Bahamas. I enjoyed both places (even though the menu could use some refreshing from time to time.\n\nThe only reason I didn't mark this as four stars?\n\nI don't know where they buy the shirts they sell, but the one from the Bahamas had a hole in the back within two months, and the one from Nashville I noticed before washing it the first time.\n\nFor the money I spent on it, I wasn't happy with it.\n\nBut the spirits were great!"}
{"input": "The piano players here are awesome. We loved them. They can play anything! The drinks are fairly priced and the $5 cover was totally worth it."}
{"input": "Josh is very knowledgable about dogs and interacts with them well. We left our bichon and border collie with him and they had a stress free vacation. A much better alternative to kennels. His home is very dog friendly and the back yard is well fenced so there is no risk of the dogs getting out. Highly recommend"}
{"input": "If you were in LA the wait would be doubled if we were at home SFe NM the price would have been tripled! Bloody Mary w a beer back and another one of their signature cocktails was only $12!!! The food was excellent, creative and hardy. A highlight of our trip to Tucson for sure!"}
{"input": "this place is out of business !!\nanyone know what happened?  did they move?"}
{"input": "Love being able to stop in and order a juice or snack that I know is going to be super fresh. Large menu of different juices to accommodate any taste bud. Always clean. Staff is always friendly and willing to answer any question you may have. Must try frozen banana!"}
{"input": "the best frozen yogurt i have found in the central bucks area (at the time of the initial review).  everyone is super friendly and the flavors are good.  but i have since found another location that is a rival.  :-0"}
{"input": "I was super excited to try this place as I love soup salad sandwich places. I wasn't disappointed in the taste of food, what I had (broth bowl and half a turkey sandwich) was really good, but holy smokes was it expensive!!!! For what my husband and I got (he got chicken noodle soup and a sandwich) it was a little over $30!! I feel for this price the portions should be bigger than what they were. Good food yes but pretty pricy for what you get."}
{"input": "One of the best places to eat in Sumner County! Excellent food and the staff is wonderful! I have had the catfish, bbq, chicken, veggies, hamburger- it's all fantastic- can't go wrong with any meal here! The prices are amazing for all the goodness you get!"}
{"input": "A new Indonesian restaurant established in the heart of South Philly with the touch of Medan taste. Sky Cafe has a small menu with popular dishes. The restaurant can seat about 30 people, so if you show up for lunch on a weekend, plan on waiting for a few minutes. Otherwise, great food and prices."}
{"input": "This place was ok, it definitely didn't blow my mind. Well, the brussel sprout appetizer did blow my mind because it was fantastic. The entree, though, did not blow my mind. I went simple and got the burger, it wasn't cooked quite the way I ordered it. Additionally, I had removed a tomato slice from my burger because it wasn't quite ripe and I'm not a lover of tomatoes all the time. A waiter walked over and informed me that I could have asked for the burger without the tomato...uh, duh? I have been to restaurants before. I just wasn't hugely impressed. Our waiter was great, though, and super helpful."}
{"input": "This is a great little comic shop and the girl behind the counter was very friendly. Thanks!"}
{"input": "BEST ICE CREAM. Why?\n-soooo many flavors\n-Unique flavors are creative and taste better than you would think\n-Classic flavors better than any chain ice cream shop\n-good price\n-fun atmosphere\n-big scoops!"}
{"input": "Great place close to cruise terminals for delicious drinks and some chips with queso. Open air bar and music made great atmosphere !"}
{"input": "Great Indian food! We received a basket of crispy crackers with four different chutneys to try as well as complimentary red pepper soup prior to our meal. My mango lassi was the perfect level of sweet and refreshing. My friend and I shared the palak paneer (and I'm looking forward to the leftovers tonight!) and the chicken shahi korma, a dish that was new to both of us...and there were no leftovers of that! It was wonderful. Both dishes were served with a side of basmati rice, and the attentive waiter offered to bring us more if we'd like. Excellent food, great value! I can't wait to try out the lunch buffet one day."}
{"input": "Both times we have come to this location the service is remarkably slow during non peak hours. the employees don't seem to listen when we order. For example I had to tell one person my order 3 times and when I repeated myself they seemed like I was imposing on them. The food is standard for Wendy's but the customer service is terrible. I won't go back which is rather unfortunate because it's just down the street."}
{"input": "I had a problem with my car and pulled in without an appointment. The friendly service techs jumped right on it and got me back on the road quickly. Their professionalism, honesty, and attention to detail was highly appreciated! I can't say enough good things about this shop!"}
{"input": "Another visit and another amazing meal at one of the best spots in all of NOLA. \n\nThis acquaint restaurant in the residential area of the lower garden district offers amazing juices and delicious tasty local breakfast and lunch faves. \n\nThe service and the atmosphere are well represented of the Nola culture."}
{"input": "Beer selection is good. Food is quality. Atmosphere is one of the best on mass ave. the staff is very friendly which makes the meal taste that much better. Wings are quality with good flavor. Always on the list for a quick pint after work."}
{"input": "Yelp doesn't allow to leave 0 star review, so that is why you see one star. Me and my wife are moving from NY to South California, and we contacted 5 different moving companies. I sent my initial email to United Van Lines on 05/02/2018, and soon I got email back with Virtual Survey confirmation for 05/10. The lady that did virtual survey was very meticulous and professional and we \"screened\" through the whole apartment in 15 minutes. No one contacted me after that, so I sent a second email almost a month after, on 06/05 asking if everything is ok, and if I can get the quote. I don't need to mention that other 4 companies sent their quotes in less than 48 hours. Since no one replied til today, I called the direct phone and I left the message on the answering machine. No one called me back. I hope everything is ok, and that no one is hurt, because I don't see any other reasonable explanation why they are avoiding me. Very, very unprofessional."}
{"input": "Great happy hour. Perfectly shucked oysters. Seriously, not one grity sea booger and I've ate here countless times. I am huge liver pate enthusiast. Luke has the best I've ever had. I usually go for  oysters, pate, and a few drinks so I can't comment on the entrees. Service is wildly inconsistent. On one occasion it was truly terrible. The manager noticed without us complaining and comped several drinks and dessert."}
{"input": "* I noticed that this location is often reviewed as serving \"the best gyros in town\". Could be. I can't say, as it's the only place in town where I've purchased a gyro.\n* I have a bit of a sour attitude toward beef and lamb mixed and grilled together. Every time I had it as a young man, it tasted... gamey. Smelled somewhat like moist dog food.\n* It's been years of avoiding gyros, until tonight. I had some time to wait here in this area, so maybe it was time to revisit the gyro from a place that seems to know what they're doing.\n* Yeah. This sauce was good enough to almost make me not notice what meat I was eating. It didn't taste bad at all. I don't think it's something I will make a regular meal, as I am sensitive to dairy/cheese."}
{"input": "I have shopped here for years and love the clothes; cool and comfortable especially on a hot summer New Orleans night!Employees are wonderful and the owner a sweetheart!"}
{"input": "I had to plan a friends' bridal shower from Alaska, and was not familiar with any of the catering places in Wayne or the surrounding area. I'm sure glad I found Crocodile! They made everything so easy to coordinate from a distance, and were so friendly when I chatted with them on the phone about my order. The food was a hit at the bridal shower! One of the attendants was a vegetarian and said her vegetarian sandwich was the best she's ever had from a deli. The only negative, if you even want to refer to it as that, was the delivery came a half an hour early, and we had to stuff everything in the fridge so it wouldn't sit out for an hour before people showed up. Again, it wasn't really a negative since I would rather they have been early than late! I wish I lived in Wayne so I could eat at Crocodile and use their services more, they were great!"}
{"input": "Quality ice cream here. There was a line this Thursday late but it moved quick. Lots of tasty sounding choices, but I chose the Loaded Butterscotch and the Nutter Butter on a chocolate waffle cone. No complaints! Both were outstanding, and the butterscotch was definitely the sweeter of the two but I'm a huge PB fan so I liked them both equally. The only negative would be that the scoops were on the small side..."}
{"input": "Wonderful burger place - and tater tots as a side dish!  What a treat this was. The wait staff was friendly and attentive. I would definitely recommend this for anyone hungry for a burger"}
{"input": "El Rey is my favorite Americanized Mexican restaurant in Nashville!! By that I mean the Mexican food that is covered in cheese... aka not really authentic but the stuff I grew up on :) \n\nWhat makes El Rey stand out is that their meat is seasoned and extremely flavorful. Typically when I go to one of these places, the chicken is bland and has zero taste. Not so at El Rey! I have had multiple dishes here and I have not been disappointed once. I eat here on a regular basis, and they are consistent with their food and it being good every time. I'm not a big ground beef fan, but my BF gets it most visits, and he said it's the best he's had from a Mexican restaurant. The salsa is also great, spicy and they bring plenty of it! (I hate asking for salsa over and over!) \n\nThe only reason they aren't getting 5 stars is because their margaritas are weak. Go for the food not the drinks, and you will not be sorry!"}
{"input": "The name says it all. Best Prime Rib in town. Service is excellent as well. On my 4 day trip to Philly I went twice."}
{"input": "I prefer this Felix's over the French quarter. Much better food here than Brisbi's - they need a drink list. Excellent food & fun on the lakefront!"}
{"input": "Luna Bella is a decent Italian restaurant.  Pros:  Decent atmosphere, huge portions (enough leftover for tomorrow's lunch), friendly staff.  Cons:  Food was a bit salty, prices were a bit steep (but the Groupon helped with that), and the live music was a little TOO background.  The band almost sounded like Muzak playing over the house speakers.\n\nI just got back from a trip to Italy the day before trying Luna Bella, so I may have been judging American-Italian against Italy-Italian food... never a fair comparison.  That being said, I probably won't go back to LB unless there's another Groupon deal."}
{"input": "I am a huge fan of Gennaro's. It's got a thin crust, sweet and rich tomato sauce along w fresh mozzarella cheese. Also, the meatballs are excellent. Can't say enough about how much I love it here. Also, the decor is vintage and adorable. \n\nI have yet to be disappointed with Gennaro's"}
{"input": "Got some delicious dinner from here and it was just as good as the other Chipotles I've been to. I got a vegan burrito bowl with a side of corn tortillas. It was very good."}
{"input": "This is my favorite brewery on Brewerytown. The beer is absolutely amazing and the menu is super unique. The food is healthy, but with enough flavor to make you feel like you're eating something complexity unhealthy! It's a small restaurant but once you find your little corner, you won't want to leave. Sample each unique beer, have a conversation with the amazing bartenders and you'll feel like a local in no time."}
{"input": "I love having this store right here in the city. All I wear is Indique hair and to have this store so close is what I need! The ladies are very helpful in helping to choose hair although I always stick with my norm. The customer service here is on point and I will continue to utilize the service! Thanks Indique!!!"}
{"input": "Have you ever tried a new lunch place and liked it so much that you went back for dinner that night and lunch the next day. I have done the back to back to back only once, at Greko. \n\nI've love the rotisserie chicken pita with fries. If you are in the mood for something healthier, they have great salads. Definitely try the Horta Greens (you can substitute fries for Horta Greens or have them on the side). The perfectly cooked and seasoned greens are delicious. \nI also love the Athenian Chicken (half a rotisserie chicken). \n\nAs a quick, casual, food-first restaurant, Greko has hit the sweet spot."}
{"input": "Someone must've known it was birthday because The Voodoo Bone Lady herself was our tour guide for my group! Me and my group did the 8 o'clock in the evening 5 in 1 Haunted tour. The Voodoo Bone Lady demonstrated great knowledge in the haunted history of New Orleans. She was also very funny and entertaining. I also loved how she handled a major distraction (a huge wedding party second lining down the middle our tour) which she turned around an included some history of that. My group and I had such a wonderful time. I highly recommend this tour!"}
{"input": "I came here with friends on a Fri or Sat night b/ Stella and Irene's Cuisine were full.  I couldn't be happier w/our luck.  \n\nI made a meal of starters b/c none of the entrees were really firing me up.  I had the pork cheeks, the gnocchi, and the duck leg confit for a little less than $30.  The food was amazing and I was happy with everything.  The portions were very large (especially the duck).\n\nThis is a great choice if you want a change from seafood (though they have seafood as well) without spending a ton of money or waiting behind crowds of people.  Would definitely go back"}
{"input": "I'm an out of tower and walked by this place at least twice looking for a place to grab dinner. This place was the perfect amount of busy, service was great and beer and food was on point. I'm from Texas and their chili (with Guac and pico, can't go wrong) promised to be spicy. It was and was delicious. The bartenders know their local beer, which is all I can ask for. Anyone can serve a Budlight, but I really appreciate them touting the local brews. I highly recommend. With that said, I dined and drank solo, and didn't use the bathrooms, so no comment on that aspect."}
{"input": "i was looking forward to a new coffee spot, but this won't be it for me.  they dont have a menu first off, and im not a coffee connoisseur, so i was a little thrown off.  i kept it simple, asked for an iced tea, but they did give me hot tea w/a cup of ice.  v. artsy crowd here, great for people watching, but not for studying.  its a little loud, my headphones were not enough to block out the noise, so i was stuck listening to watever they chose, which wasn't my preference.  the servers were all really nice, and they kept cleaning the tables quite often.  all in all it wasnt a bad experience, but not one to keep me coming back either..."}
{"input": "Terrific local business with excellent service. Fast and affordable!"}
{"input": "Do not eat here! I ordered general tso tofu and asked for it to be extra crispy with light sauce. Not only did it come out FULL of sauce, but they refused to replace it and only offered to drain the extra sauce. Needless to say, it was bland and soggy. Never again."}
{"input": "An amazing view, impeccable professional service great fare,don't  skip a visit to this Philadelphia gem. Nick, who is a stellar, incredible server, recommended a lovely 2010 Bordeaux-Chateau Font Merlet which complemented the Tuna Tartare and Steak Tataki.\n\nThis is a must see in Philadelphia. After witnessing a fabulous nighttime view, I can't wait to return to check out the spectacular sunsets."}
{"input": "Fresh food, quality service, and inspiring decor. We walked in and were immediately greeted by the staff and made to feel at home. The paintings on the wall are colorful and fun. The food is prepared with love. The ginger tea is a must!"}
{"input": "Been coming here for months and between the beer, down to earth awesome waiters and incredible beers this has been one of my favorite places for a while. \nThe black bean burger here is incredible! I wouldnt call it the best in town just yet, but i did drive out of the way to come here just to have it. \nIf your an IPA person you have to stop by for the dragon fly which is on tap year around. Every sunday when they have 3$ pints we drive up here from south indy just for the dragonfly/burger combo.\nAnd now that its warmer outside the outdoor seating really tops it all off..\nLets not leave out the FREE wifi!"}
{"input": "Very good food served fast and friendly,   Meal was hot and beer cold like it should be.  It's in the station so weather effects room temperature it's 18 outside so it's cool in side the station.   Would rather not watch CNN (Fake News) or NFL but little story telling is good to laugh at.  I would eat here again if passing through on train. Had the philly streak, fries very very good very good. Cost with a Philadelphia pale ale (bottle) $20.82"}
{"input": "Very good blackened Mahi Tacos and my favorite beer, Yeungling too! Nice, casual atmosphere to watch the sunset over the Gulf."}
{"input": "I try my hardest to only eat at local restaurants, but have to say that after last night's service for me and the people sitting at the communal table with me...I will never spend my hard earned money at this local establishment again. The disrespect and poor sevice from the kitchen and manager on duty was shocking.  I would appreciate communication from the owner of this restaurant.  You really need to understand how your visitors are being treated."}
{"input": "Milktooth is the place to go if you want a good breakfast cocktail and a twist on traditional brunch. At first glance of the menu, you may think you've never heard of any of these foods for breakfast, and you may be right. I guarantee no matter what you order, you're going to enjoy it. \n\nMilktooth is one of the most popular brunch places in Indy, which means you will typically have a wait. Trust me, it's worth the usual 30 minute wait (on weekends). To make it go by a little faster, they've got a walk up bar for their coffee drinks and pastries. Snack on one of those to give you a preview of the amazing meal you're about to have.\n\nTheir menu changes from time to time but they have a few things that stay one the menu but change ingredients. I love all of their variations on a Dutch pancake, and their raclette grilled cheese is to die for.  If you're making this a boozy breakfast, don't pass up on the michelada. And sit outside if it's warm enough!"}
{"input": "My friend and I came here around 2pm on a Monday. It happened by default, as most of the restaurants on Main Street were closed. We sat ourselves down at the bar and got to drinking. After a few drinks, I ordered the pulled pork tacos and my friend had a burrito. Not bad, not stellar. Just a standard very place to drink and eat Mexican food. It's got a very college feel even in the middle of the day, so keep that in mind if that's not your thing."}
{"input": "My friend recommended this place and I am glad she did! The room was very cute! We got the king room with hot tub and fireplace. Utilized both and had such a romantic weekend. It was pretty close to everything too. The only negative is the TV is pretty old but we barely watched TV. Plus is they have an iHome dock station that is compatible with iPhone 5's and newer."}
{"input": "Sehr nettes kleines ruhiges typisches amerikanisches Motel. Standard-Zimmer und Einrichtung, aber sauber. Nette Rezeption.\nDas Highlight ist aber natürlich der Strand - einfach vom letzten Zimmer ca. 50 Meter und schon ist man im Wasser!\nNatürlich aufgrund der Lage der perfekte Ort um die Sonne ins Meer zu fallen sehen (aka Sonnenuntergang).\nLiegestühle und Grills am Strand sowie ein schöner Pool runden das positive Erlebnis ab."}
{"input": "They have a drink menu that would fit any palate. It's one of the few restaurants I have seen with a Pimm's Cup on the menu... the food menu is also extensive. Try the popcorn which has quite a kick to it, that can be offset by any beverage. They also have many vegan options, which is great for those friends that are vegan and always complaining about finding somewhere to eat. The BBQ Vegan Pulled Pork was delicious, as were the sweet potato fries and collared greens. It was a Sunday, so service was a bit overwhelmed by the large crowd. Don't go if you have a time limit. Also, found the background music a bit too loud."}
{"input": "My go to place for sushi rolls! Their rolls are huge and the service is excellent. My favorite is heat attack appetizer( korean style jalapeno poppers) sapporo roll and honey roll. They also have a section of deepfried rolls on the menu! Their food always look so  fresh and appetizing. Great presentation. Try the spicy sashimi bowl if you wanna try something new!"}
{"input": "We got this hotel on Hotwire and now I understand why we got such a \"great deal.\" The staff was friendly and courteous, but the parking garage was a bit scary and hard to get around in. The hotel was hard to navigate and a big disorienting. On Saturday night, two floors above our room a wedding DJ blared music until 11pm while our two young kids were trying to sleep. The front desk was not helpful after we informed them of the noise. The free breakfast at the attached restaurant was mediocre and ran out out of food the second morning of our stay. Oh, and there was a bug on our table as we sat down. Maybe I should have put one star. Meh, I'll be nice. The fitness center and pool was alright."}
{"input": "My group really enjoyed our Culinary History tour with Bob. He was entertaining, honest, and gave us some really great pointers about where to go in the city. I was pleased with the great balance of delicious food and interesting trivia we were served on the tour. I would highly recommend it!"}
{"input": "The experience is fun and girly, but the food doesn't back it up.  Go for dessert or a cocktail, don't get a full meal. I don't think it's worth it."}
{"input": "This is not the closest salon to my house, and I've done Groupons for other places, but I end up back here because the manis and pedis are good, reasonable, and the technicians are thorough and sweet."}
{"input": "My favorite sushi restaurant in West County. Amazing sushi, beautiful dining space. Great for dates or family you want to impress."}
{"input": "They never forget to say, \"Welcome to Moooooes\". I find the menu somewhat confusing. Everything I've had is good. Queso is so-so; guacamole is so-so. Service is fast though, even at weekday lunch time."}
{"input": "My friends and I tried this place a few days ago. The location was very easy to find and the place looked beautiful. Great place for a party. We decided to try the \"high tea\". We tried both tea options and the food was delicious. The table setting looked so pretty and we all had different style of plates. I'll definitely recommend this place for anything from bridal showers to birthday party's."}
{"input": "Fantastic!!  \n\nWent here for brunch on Sunday.  It was great.  The coffee was hot and hit the spot.  My friend and I split a few different items.  We had the fruit and granola.  It was tasty.  Fresh blueberries and blackberries and crunchy granola.\n\nWe also shared the French toast and the chopped chicken salad.  The French toast came with two slices and apples.  We didn't need to add any extra syrup.  It was wonderful and sweet.  The chopped chicken salad was also great.\n\nThe lettuce was a mix of greens.  The bacon was thick cut pieces, and the chicken was plentiful.  In addition the vinegarette was great. It went perfectly with the salad.\n\nWe ended the meal with $5 mimosas. \n\nOverall it was a great Sunday brunch.  Cannot wait to try dinner here."}
{"input": "I don't know why everyone is hatin' on this place. Microwaved pasta? That's what you'd compare pasta from Boston Pizza or Sbarro with.\nBut anyways, I'm not a huge pasta enthusiast - I never really crave it. But my boyfriend does and whenever he mentions this place I get a pasta hankering. \nI usually order the Borsetti (I think that's what it's called) and it always tastes delicious and fresh. All the salads and soups I've had there are great as well.\nThe service can be a bit slow sometimes but that's hardly worth taking a star away."}
{"input": "I was really good pizza and wings. I would definitely come back. We came with kids and it was ok. I guess it depends on what you have in mind for the atmosphere. There's a lot of tvs so with kids it can be distracting but that's what people are there for to watch a game and eat pizza. Overall good and definitely good food."}
{"input": "This is by far the best lunch counter i have been to. The food is always fresh and the staff is friendly and eager to help. It's obvious that chef nirasha takes pride in her food and its appearance because the presentation of her food is absolutely beautiful. They have a quinoa brittle snack that is a healthy addicting and delicious alternative snack. The owners go above and beyond to host fundraisers and give backs for their community and local school on a regular basis. I would highly recommend them!!"}
{"input": "I've been to Mirna's about four times over the past few years and never been disappointed. The portions are HUGE, especially for the modest price tag. Do yourself a favor and get a pasta dish, I can assure you that you'll be glad you did. I've had fish there too, which wasn't bad by any means, but the pasta plates are definitely their specialty. A couple of the times I've been there they treated us to free hummus and pita, which is always a plus. BYOB!\n\nOnly knock on the place is that it's pretty small, so make sure to call ahead to reserve a table or check for a wait."}
{"input": "This Wendy's is a good location. Open 24 hours for the midnight fry and frosty fix. They are pretty busy all day long so they are constantly making food non-stop.\nThe downfall to the constant food production is that sometimes they make so much, a burger may sit around and get luke warm. I did just have a cool temp burger and nuggets, however when i brought it the their attention, they immediately made sure i got fresh 'hot and juicy' food. Not a big deal but does need patience. \nSince i ate inside it was not that big a deal, if i went to the drive through and then hopped on the Turnpike before i took a bite, i would be very upset.\nFood quality was consistent with other Wendy's and the 4th star was for customer service and fixing the mistake like a pro!"}
{"input": "I visited Just Cookies to get some chocolate chip cookies for a friend and I before a concert at the (awesome) Murat.  Specialty bakeries are the best, unfortunately, this place was the worst.  For cookies at this price, they should be better than the discount day-old cookies at the supermarket..  much better, even!  But these were, somehow, worse.  Not just dry, but bland.  I couldn't believe that a bakery specializing on just one item could do them so poorly.  And while the woman was not explicitly rude, she certainly wasn't friendly either (not even a smile.)\n\nTo Just Cookies, I'll Just say No!"}
{"input": "Perfect spot in Nashville! So sad it will be gone soon! Perfect mix of dive bar and music! Everyone was friendly ! We tried to get back later but the rain got the best of us!"}
{"input": "Beachside bar fun.  Great. Ire of the Gulf.   Service is good.  Food is lack luster.   I had the stuffed mushrooms and they were burnt.   The Lobster Bisque was in the sweet side but okay. \n\nSecond time coming to Sams.  The place requires you pay 2.00 to park as it is a state beach."}
{"input": "Went here after lunch at kitchen 519. Got a ricotta cookie and a sticky bun that we were told had a Danish filling but it was just a plain old sticky bun. Still good and def was eaten. They had a multitude of cupcakes w all diff and eclectic flavors. Id like to try one next time."}
{"input": "Jenna and Noel exhibited the perfect example of impeccable service and genuine hospitality. I was driving when I got a flat tire and had to pull into the Fleming's parking lot. The roadside assistance service was taking forever so I walked into Fleming's for food and drink. The kitchen was closed at 2:00 and not opening until 4 o'clock for dinner, but Jenna and Noel happened to overhear my telephone conversation about my flat tire situation. They immediately poured me a drink and asked the Chef to open the kitchen early to cook me a meal. After they also invited me to try a new wine they were considering adding to the menu. They went above and beyond for me during a time they were not supposed to be working simply because they knew I was dealing with a stressful situation. Acts of kindness like this are rarer than gold. I never do online reviews but I could not let this story go untold. Thank you for the excellent food and service! Will certainly be back!"}
{"input": "This place is good.  No doubt.  I like the creativity in the tex-mex cuisine.\nMy sister in law loves this place.\n\nWe had ceviche, it was ok, the texture wasn't great.  My husband really didn't care for it at all.\n\nThen we had our entrees, which were pretty standard, very decent sized portions and the taste was good.\n\nNot a huge fan of chains, we would go back if someone really wanted to go there, but it's not a place that we think of when we say \"HEY, let's go for some southwestern fare.\""}
{"input": "Excellent spicy Szechuan food.  I have enjoyed everything I've had here.  Service can be a little slow for lunchtime, but the food makes up for it.  If you don't want MSG in your food (I don't), make sure to ask for no-MSG.  I consider MSG to be cheating and I expected better from them.  I honestly think the food tastes just as good without it."}
{"input": "Tucked in behind a number of other establishments, this is the place to go when you want your bad-for-you-but-oh-so-delicious fix. The menu is pretty straightforward, and if you're like almost everyone else you'll get the grab bag of three beignets doused liberally in powdered sugar.\n\nYum."}
{"input": "I love their breakfast burritos. I usually get bacon, egg, cheese and potatoes. The potatoes are  well seasoned and cut small, so you don't end up getting a burrito that is about 95% full of overdone, mushy potatoes. You can actually taste the eggs, bacon and potatoes. Could use a bit more cheese, but that's a minor complaint. Nice selection of salsas at the salsa bar and the staff has always been friendly and welcoming. Very glad that they are located about a mile from my house! Hopefully they will be here for a long time."}
{"input": "Three out of four times I came for servicing (oil change, tire replacement, and inspection) I had an early morning appointment and was told they probably couldn't get the job done....it got done, but took several hours. Today, I went in for oil change (no appointment) ready to drop my car off for the day and was told (after waiting in line for 25 min) that there were no available appointments for 3 days. This location clearly can't handle basic servicing, so they surly won't  have to worry about my car anymore."}
{"input": "Skip this train wreck if you are looking for dinner.  Our server was clueless...like we seriously thought she was lost in the restaurant.  Had to ask for setups, water refills, etc.  Ordered chicken parmesan and got eggplant parmesan instead with a fish bone in it.  The drinks were good."}
{"input": "I went here looking for a gift. I read the good reviews and decided to check it out. As I walked around I did not touch anything in the store until I got to a t shirt which I opened to look and and folded and put down. I got remarks from the owner which I could barely understand and I told her I was just looking at it. I then was looking at the cards (and yes I did actually intend on buying one) I picked one up and the owner said something which I did not understand and I stated excuse me and she said you do not understand my English. I proceeded to look at another card to see what it said and the owner came over took the card from me and told me not to touch them and took every card in the row to inspect as if I damaged them. I have never experienced that in my life where looking at a non breakable item like that was such a horrible deed. Not a way to get business. Hard to believe given so many excellent reviews but\nI'll spend my money elsewhere."}
{"input": "We had both of the two French toasts--both were good. The pork belly benni pleased but my \"steak and and eggs\" biscuit was the best. \nThis place gets mobbed on a weekend morning. By 9:00 am there's a long wait, and parking is a problem too."}
{"input": "Happen upon this location in search of a post New Year Eve breakfast.  Even w/o reservations we were seated almost immediately. Party of 4 ordered pancakes, eggs and frittata all which were good, problem was the service. Two in our party received their food the other two did not. Nothing worse than half the table getting their food while the others have to wait!!!  Folks w/o food say \" go ahead, don't wait\". In my opinion this is just about the worst thing a restaurant could do to a guest.  Despite the food being good the type of service we received during our visit caused us to have a poor dining experience.  Unfortunately we left the location vowing never to return.  Please 1682 work on this issue, it's important and has a huge impact on the customer experience. Food get 4 stars, service gets 1."}
{"input": "Did not catch our servers name but he was amazing and made the experience that much better. He reccomended the Scallop and Shrimp entree, and to get it over pasta and it was outstanding. My son ordered the kids cheeseburger. I was a little disappointed because the rolls they use are plain store bought potato rolls that I buy at the supermarket all the time."}
{"input": "Have become a regular and love it! Favorite flavor flavor are Mango and Thai Snow smoothie."}
{"input": "I can't speak for anything but the Red Beans and Rice, as my husband and I come here exclusively for that and order the same thing every time! We've tried  this dish at a few other places, and nothing comes close to what's cookin' at The Praline Connection. \n\nI highly recommend stopping in for a plate of Red Beans and Rice. The service is as good as the food!!"}
{"input": "I will eat ANYTHING in one of Pico De Gallo's handmade corn tortillas. I tend to eat the fish or the tongue tacos, but the barbacoa tacos are delicious , too. The beans are great. The rice is great. Sometimes the hot sauce is so spicy it will burn a hole through you, but really it's all about those corn tortillas."}
{"input": "This place is a great place to stay with a lively tap room adjacent to the lobby.  Their were two sides to the hotel,.. I have stayed in the renovated part and the historic rooms as well. The renovated rooms are a little more roomy,.. but with the same quality.  I am very much a fan!!"}
{"input": "I've been going to Mark for at least 2 years now. I've gone to salons like Dominic Michael etc and am used to paying $35 plus tip for a cut. I learned about Blades and since I knew the owner had salon experience felt comfortable trying him. Mark is a great guy and I always love my cut."}
{"input": "This is my kind of joint!  Cozy, great atmosphere, and the staff have been nothing but excellent to me. I love their mini pizzas. One of my servers even made me an off menu dirty vodka martini and prepared the cheese stuffed olives for me fresh...wow! Kale chips rocked also, loved the tangy yogurt dip. They have a live piano player some nights, totally classy and he was quite talented. Lilly's is the kind of place St Louis City deserves. Check them out."}
{"input": "My kids have been going here since they were small. My oldest is about to transition to kindergarten and she's is so well prepared. The staff is awesome and my kids talk about them all the time at home. Highly recommend!!"}
{"input": "Lovely hotel with the nicest, most helpful staff I have ever had the pleasure to deal with. From the concierge, desk, housekeeping, and valet all wonderful. The only reason I didn't give them a five was the breakfast buffet is expensive and average at best. Fortunately, the Ruby Slipper is next door! This is my new favorite hotel in Nola!"}
{"input": "They reopened up derived new management.. this was our 3rd time there. They have daily specials, which is a pretty good price, $7.95 for a plate, ice-tea and soup. Todays (Friday)special, they had Carne Asada with rice n beans, fried fish plate and 2 chicken enchiladas with rice n beans, all come with tea n soup. \n\nWe both had the Carne asada plate but they let me substitute my rice n beans for a salad. Steak was pretty good. \n\nI think their specials are different everyday. So for the most part it was good all around. Oh service was good n attentive."}
{"input": "Even though the sushi masters are not actually Asian but they make good Sushi. The price is also cheap."}
{"input": "Tried ordering online. When I asked for topping suggestions the guy hung up on me. Ridiculous"}
{"input": "This place is great! I always get the buffalo chicken cheesesteak with American cheese and it comes out good every time. The employees are always nice as well. Only thing I don't like is the horrible yellow lights they have above the seating area outside! It's like an instant headache!"}
{"input": "Love this place! First time going and I will def be back. Got gel manicure and eyebrow wax. Staff was friendly, store was quiet & professional. Def a little hidden gem."}
{"input": "Maybe I just don't like gift shops. They have some fun and quirky stuff here but nothing I would ever really want to receive as a gift, so it's nothing I would ever give as a gift either. I love supporting local businesses, but most of the time I stop in here for something I leave empty handed."}
{"input": "The best! Kia is my favorite! She is very experienced and works really quickly. She tries to make it as painless as possible and she's pleasant the entire time. I've had a few other wax specialists and they were all great too, but Kia is the best."}
{"input": "Love their sandwiches. Delicious. Have tried everything from the bird to the Marley nachos and have never had anything short of great. But, service is pretty relaxed. Meaning it can be slow but I just make sure that I come when I have enough time. Good stuff."}
{"input": "This is a pretty historical building that is well maintained. When we visited, we were the ONLY people there, which meant the Park Ranger gave us a private tour. Sweet!\n\nAlso - if you're into collecting National Park Stamps, you can get a few here! w00t!"}
{"input": "It's a place to go if your hungry and have a big appetite burgers are good and come out quick there onion straws are to die for with the sauce  the service was on top of things right away (thanks zack!!)   made us feel welcomed and was that way to everybody even helped other servers when he probably didn't have to!  Would recommend this place to others in a heart beat. However we came to early to hear the live music but was outside with a great breeze.  Can't ask for much more"}
{"input": "The Blue Duck is located in this very small plaza filled with very bland store signs, but don't let the outside appearance fool you. Inside is very cozy, clean, and nicely decorated.\n\nThe staff is always friendly and attentive, and the food is pretttty good. Their duck fries are amazzzzing and the portion is huge! I can never finish an order with my girlfriend and it sucks that it doesn't taste half as good when heated up later. The burger here is really big and unique, but I feel that the meat blend can be a bit better as it seems a bit tough. The brunch menu here is a lot cooler than the normally offered lunch menu (the duck fries are still offered!), and would much rather come for when they are offering brunch."}
{"input": "The environment is cool and the service was awesome. I will return solely for how delicious the fries were. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is the cheese sauce on my burger was broken so it was very gritty and it was kind of hard to eat. Seriously though the fries."}
{"input": "We just moved to this area of town, and thought we would give this place a try.  We have now been 2 times in the same week.  If you aren't used to spicy foods, be very careful when selecting their heat levels of 0-5.  A heat level of 1 was hotter than I expected, but I'm a wimp.  Totally worth the burn, though!  Definitely a place I'm putting on my frequent rotation of favorites.  Service wasn't awesome, but that could have been based on the time of day.  Try not to run out of your drink, though!"}
{"input": "Tip: Order on their website for fast, free delivery!\n\nMumbai is probably the cheapest indian takeout I've had. The food is great and tastes much healthier than the other Indian restaurants I've been to in the past. There are some really great vegan choices and everything is marked on the menu as well. \n\nI really like that you can go on their website and order food for very quick delivery. I only eaten inside the restaurant once and thought it was good. I think Mumbai is more useful for delivery as the place has a fast-food feel. \n\nI would definitely recommend Mumbai Bistro!"}
{"input": "apparently i'm the only one who doesn't think the beignets at morning call are better than the ones at cafe du monde.  i like someone else to regulate my powdered sugar, i guess.\n\ni do, however, think the coffee here kicks the crap out of pretty much anything you'll find in the area.  heavy on the chicory.  yummy."}
{"input": "The St. Paul sandwich is just about perfect. Lack of vegetarian egg rolls is the only bummer for me. It's always fast and delicious here."}
{"input": "The secret to GIgi and Big R is NOT to order the fried chicken. The fried chicken is still a very solid choice, but nothing too special. Instead go with the jerk chicken. It's just a little bit spicy and it's oh-so-tender and juicy. \n\nFor sides, I almost always go with the mac n' cheese and the dirty rice. The mac n' cheese is much like the fried chicken, very solid but nothing special. However, the dirty rice is amongst the best I've had, and yes, I have had Bojangles.\n\nAlso, skip the sandwich. It's just...chicken between two slices of plain white bread. Get the platter! \n\nYes, you can expect to wait for your food at Gigi's, but it's worth it!"}
{"input": "My husband's cousin brought us here for lunch on the recommendation of his coworker.  None of us had ever been here before.  I have to say, when you walk through the door and it smells delicious, that's a good sign.  All the food was great.  One of us ordered flautas, one of us had a carne asada chimichanga, and I had a carne asada topopo salad (I just had to order that because I thought the name \"topopo\" was a trip!) We all really enjoyed our food and they serve very generous portions, none of us could even finish.  Also they have yummy margaritas! I had two mango margaritas and I highly recommend them!"}
{"input": "I travel to New Orleans very frequently and usually stay closer to the French Quarter at other Marriott properties but I decided to stay at the Renaissance in the arts district because of the close proximity to the WW2 museum and my expectations were far exceeded for this stay. Overall, the hotel was AMAZING and the staff was very gracious and friendly, specifically, the night supervisor, Mandy Smith, went above and beyond her pay grade to make out this visit in the FIVE STAR category. Will I be back? Yes!!"}
{"input": "Food was good. I had the avgolemano soup (almost as good as my mother's, just a bit too much rice in it) and the lamb souvlaki for lunch with a side of horta.  Well executed food, once it came out. However, the service was horrid. I kept thinking Gordon Ramsey was in the back yelling \"Oh come on!\" because the entire, full, restaurant was getting no food from the kitchen.\n\nIt's really too bad, because for standard Greek fare, they hit the mark.  But even in Greece, the service is better."}
{"input": "I Love this food here! My first time here I was so skeptical because of all the contraversy serounding this place but I'm so happy I decided to eat here."}
{"input": "Went for lunch and the food on the buffet was fantastic! The onion chutney was amazing!"}
{"input": "Much better and scariest than HHN, awesome interactions throughout the hunted attractions."}
{"input": "Always a great experience ... I come to see the specialist dr bossbaly .... and she is fantastic ... my dog Lillyanna ,has been living a fairly great life with her recommendations ..... and the doctor herself has a great way about her .... the practice is great also ... very helpful and accommodating .....if you want the best and can afford to pay for , I highly recommend ......"}
{"input": "1. Bad service\n- all the waitresses were congregating by the cash register. not minding the place\n- food came out but we weren't asked what condiments we wanted nor were we provided any eating utensils. I guess it's a self service kinda place.\n\n2. Bad food\n- old cold fries\n- unseasoned and overcooked burger. buns weren't even  toasted.\n\nDon't go there for food."}
{"input": "Is there any way that I can give a sixth or even seventh star to this place? Perhaps I'll contact the Yelp! corporate offices in San Francisco to inquire about expanding the star system using Lou and All About Hair as the Exhibit A. I've been on a three year odyssey, which has included some of the worst haircuts and barbers this side of, well, anything, to find a place like All About Hair. It is simply fantastic. I was here early on a Friday morning and aside from doing an incredible to the follicles that rest atop my head, Lou provided fantastic conversation and an environment that was more than inviting. I haven't written a Yelp! review in a very long time, but after my experience at All About Hair, I felt compelled to fire off a five star review about this gem of a place. Needless to say, I've found my barber of choice and they've made a long-term customer out of me."}
{"input": "Really like this place. The food is amazing, great atmosphere and the hostess has such a positive energy. It was my friend's first time and he definitely enjoyed it and wants to come back. The shrimp salad with the lime chili dressing was refreshing."}
{"input": "Just had a late dinner there on a Sunday night and was really surprised at how good the sushi was and how low my ticket was. I had a plate full of sushi and it cost me $13.00. The staff seems to be having a good time too. Very friendly place. I really enjoyed it and will be back soon!"}
{"input": "This was by far my favorite Cuban sandwich of all the Cubans I've had to date. We were treated to a free coffee after the meal as well as a spin of the wheel which led to a free dessert. Over all the experience was excellent.  I can't wait to go there again."}
{"input": "Arrived here early for our ghost tour, hoping to catch a bite to eat and a couple brews but was totally ignored by the bartender. So we ate elsewhere then returned. Took advantage of the ghost tour's 2 for 1 Hurricane special. $12 for the most disgusting sugar powdered alcoholic beverages I've ever tried. Ended up throwing them away and getting a couple beers. I would not seek this place out if it weren't for the ghost tour, which was great btw."}
{"input": "In town on business. Great food. Fried oysters, lamp chops and dessert were all A+, coming from a New Yorker. Reasonable prices. Great service."}
{"input": "Amber is all about expectations. If you're looking for the best americanized Punjabi food in Indy, this is it. If you want authentic and more varied food, look elsewhere (I'd point you at Sizzling India on north Allisonville). Service and decor are nothing special but, in comparison to other other Indian restaurants that often offer Indian levels of service, Amber is above average."}
{"input": "Popped in just before an IMAX films.  The crepes look marvelous and I want to go back there to eat. This trip we sampled home made candy- they have a candy corn 'fudge' and a pumpkin 'fudge' that are the BOMB."}
{"input": "Coming from a NYC sweets-hater - these donuts are DIVINE. Luxuriously extravagant and very creative. I had a banana pudding donut with a house brew. Others on display were Thai Iced Tea, PB&J and Milk & Cereal. So cute. \n\nTaste is absolutely bomb.com. Will make it a pit-stop next time I'm in NO."}
{"input": "Amazing Gym. One of the best decisions I've ever made. The gym culture is very  welcoming to everyone but also competitive. There are absolutely no gym problems such as people with big ego. None. The coaches are world class and very chill."}
{"input": "Came here on a whim a few years ago.  Was hoping it was as good as I remembered.\nI\nWas\nNot\nDisappointed.\nEveryone I brought with me was really impressed.  \nStandouts include the pork belly and the fish tacos. Cocktail program is on point as well.  Go.  See for yourself."}
{"input": "The best thai food I've tried in the area. I live about 30min away and wish I lived closer. The red curry and the pad thai and the chicken satay with peanut sauce is so so good! Lunch specials are great!"}
{"input": "Delicious! Had the Crazy Old Goat and Tomato Basil soup. Staff was very friendly too :)  I will be back soon!"}
{"input": "Beautiful supermarket but beauty isn't free. Everything is more expensive here.\n\nThey do have a great hot food bar. Their deli has a great system for slicing meats exactly how you want them when you order and how they pack them is perfect.\n\nTheir Jewish food area is great. Good whitefish salad and RJs bagels.\n\nIf you need a hard to find item it's probably here, but again, loosen your purse strings!"}
{"input": "Burger was great but not the best I have ever had. Good service and ambiance. Had their salad special and wasn't my favorite but most likely because it was different than I had pictured. Slightly overpriced. Happy I tried but too many great places to return again"}
{"input": "Recently moved away from St. Louis and I miss this place. The atmosphere is very interesting and unique, first of all. The decor is pretty unusual and it's fun to sit on the balcony. The food is great and all locally sourced and homemade, even their ice cream. And really, if you go, you have to try the ice cream. My favorite thing to order is the Rumchata milkshake, which is made from Rumchata and their homemade cinnamon ice cream."}
{"input": "First visit for breakfast. Location is convenient in a small strip mall with Trader Joe's and Starbucks.  Place is clean and servers are friendly. I ordered bacon avocado omelet which came with toast and a side of potatoes. It was ok but I expected more for the price. I also had coffee and creams were prepackaged. I am used to real cream. Overall it was your average breakfast and prices were ok. I am giving 4 stars mainly for location and service."}
{"input": "Tried the char grilled oysters and they were excellent.  The bartender recommended them and she was spot on with that suggestion.  The creole gumbo was good too.  It had a nice little kick of spiciness to it. The bread pudding was an excellent finish for the meal.  If you are on bourbon street this is a good choice for some place to stop and eat."}
{"input": "We just returned from a girls' weekend trip to this hotel and I have nothing but praise. Our room was lovely, so clean and spacious (walk in closet!) We had a double queen suite. The hotel is about 1 mile from the FQ, but the walk is pleasant and the River Walk Outlet is on the way. The front desk staff were always so outgoing and friendly, and they really helped us with questions about the Krewe of Boo parade. Even the valet greeted us every morning and we didn't even have a car! It doesn't have the rustic charm of a FQ hotel, but for half the price, you can spend your time exploring what NOLA has to offer!"}
{"input": "Stopped by to munch a burger during today's Seahawks/Saints game, and the place was, unsurprisingly, packed. For good reason, too: the Haven burger I ordered was fantastic.\n\nI sat right next to the door, so I didn't get the chance to get more than six feet into the place; as soon as I got my meal, the place started getting busier and busier until I had to work my way through the World's Shortest People Maze to get out. Guess that means I wasn't the first person to hear about the place.\n\nI will be going back to the Haven. Might go for, say lunch on a Tuesday, so it's less busy."}
{"input": "I hesitated to give 5 stars only because it is more of a take out place for me, but for what it is it deserves 5 stars.  This is not the sit down with a date kind of place (although their dining area is clean and well kept).  I think it is 5 star worthy for the quality of food you get for the price.\nI make crab rangoon and because of that I usually don't like restaurant's crab rangoon, but theirs is excellent.  Their dishes are also very fresh and flavorful.  My favorite is the Roast Pork in Garlic sauce which they modify for me to not be hot.\nI've never had a problem with the service, they are always very friendly and fast.\nHighly recommend!!"}
{"input": "(only a three star review because we were only able to try the crab cakes and the clam chowder, so it's not fair to give this place too high or too low of a mark)\n\nquickly:\nCrab cakes - tender and crumbly. They don't taste like \"crab\" which is what I prefer. The crab cakes come with a side of gianormos onion rings (i loved those).\n\nclam chowder - pretty standard. it didn't blow your mind, but it also wasn't too \"fishy\" which can happen with clam chowder.\n\nWe saw everyone ordering crab and lobster, and we just salivated at the thought - we had dinner plans later that day so we couldn't try any of the big shellfish items. They definitely looked delicious!\n\nsome notes: \n-The indoor seating is limited. It's a small \"shack\" at the end of the pier. It was cold and windy the day we were there (yeah, can you believe it?) so there was more of a wait to sit inside.\n- not good for big groups indoors\n-parking is free with validation"}
{"input": "Menu looked promising, my friend said her burger was great.  I made the mistake of ordering a chicken sandwich in a burger place ... came out almost too dry to eat."}
{"input": "Great experience purchasing a washer and dryer.  I just bought a new home and needed all new appliances. Iam so glad I decided to go even though the reviews were not great which I don't understand since I had no issues whatsoever. There was an excellent selection, knowledgeable salespeople and timely delivery. The level of service we received was beyond expected! I really felt like they were working hard to give me the best price and offered many options to stay in my budget  They even took the time to check if there were any additional sales prices or discounts they could offer me. I was given honest feedback and all of my questions were answered. I am very happy with Sears and I would highly recommend!"}
{"input": "I love coming here! All of the Chiropractors are knowledgeable, quick, and very kind! They gave me a key fob to scan in when I come in. I love it because they have an automated system that directs me to the table. The reception staff is very helpful and wonderful! I recommend this place to anybody looking for a great chiropractic family! They have a massage chair that you can sit in while you wait. They always have treats while you visit. They work with you on payment plans if you can't afford a lump sum."}
{"input": "Fantastic  Sam's  Hair  Salon  in  Zephyrhills,  Florida  is  a  great  find!!  I  have  been  a  customer  for  about  10  years.  I  often  get  compliments  for  weeks  after  I  get  my  hair  done  here.  Great  for  hair  color!! It  is  HARD  to  find  colorists  in  this  part  of  Florida.\nWish  I  could  come  here  more  often!!!"}
{"input": "Absolutely amazing food! Everything is extremely fresh, homemade and majestic in the mouth. It's a bit pricey considering the portions and Ambiance but other than that... Amazing"}
{"input": "Great experience today! The young lady that greeted me at the door was very friendly and helpful, and then when Claire finally came over to assist me I was very happy. She was patient, personable, and knowledgeable. I am so happy with my new phone and she made the process extremely easy. If you are as high maintenance as I am, ask for Claire and she will take great care of you!"}
{"input": "I recently went here with the hubby and a friend and we got the vegetable pakora to start- which was like veggies and hushpuppies all in one- YUM! Then we each got an entree: chicken tikki masala, lamb roganjosh, and lamb vindaloo. Each dish was superb, authentic, and exactly what it should be. The sauces for each were so good I wanted to drink them. Had I saved any room in my tummy, I just might have! \n\nThe place was reasonably priced and the staff/service was just okay. All-in-all, a great addition to Media's varied dinner spots. The lunch buffet looked promising, too, and is only $9.95 on weekdays, $10.95 on wknds."}
{"input": "We stopped by for a quick lunch and ordered a classic and the Depot burger, we asked specifically that they be rare, the classic came in closer to medium, and Depot burger had no pink at all, why is it so hard to make a rare burger. Any way the food was good, the grilled onions we're awesome. Our waitress was great and the over cook burger was removed from our bill with an apology. Talk about being a stand up place, we will go again and most likely recommend."}
{"input": "Great service .. food was delish. FRIED AVOCADO!  Tres leches cake was yum!  Cuban sandwich was simple and tasty"}
{"input": "I've been a fan for years . However the last two visits within the last two months were disappointing. The wings were extremely small . The portions are equivalent to most kids meals . The wings are tasty that's not enough to keep my loyalty .Unfortunately I will not be placing future orders ."}
{"input": "Worst of the worst. Ordered three items and waited 40 minutes for the barbecued shrimp to come out. Told me the others were on the way. 10 more minutes and a small plate of rice came out as the Jambalaya. Asked what was supposed to be in the dish- chicken and sausage. No sign of either (or the catfish Poboy).  Finally gave up and asked for a refund which took another 10 minutes and refunded the wrong amount- at which point we had enough.  Stay away!!"}
{"input": "They make a great show out of the cooking process right in front of you! Just make sure you don't order sushi or seat at the bar ;)\nAnd it's not expensive, and it tastes good! I definitely am going to this place next time I visit Santa Barbara."}
{"input": "Smash burger is pretty good. \n\nThey have TONS of different options - from pre-determined combos to build your own. \n\nI got mine with guac last night - YUM! It was great. They also over avocado slices, and I like that you can get either. \n\nThe girl taking my order was SO NICE and awesome. She was great. \n\nThe smash fries taste delicious - garlic and rosemary. However, they were oily and soggy - probably were not fried at the correct temperature. The onion rings were great. \n\nPrices are good, sizes are good. Passed a salad on my way out - they're giant!!!!"}
{"input": "So happy to have my buffet back! It's absolutely beautiful! My step Father picked this piece up 2nd hand 20 years ago. I have had it for over 10. It was loved and broken in to say the least. The drawers stuck, one cabinet had to be pried open. I contacted Southern Transit Repair to restore and repair it. It is stunning! Great job very professional. I highly recommend them."}
{"input": "The food is always delicious. Their homemade guacamole is the best in town. They have bingo every Wednesday night at 6:30pm and trivia every Thursday night at 6:30pm. Those are the BEST times to go! Make sure you get there a little early. I gets packed and they get extremely busy. I just wish they had more seating! ;)"}
{"input": "The food here was much better when it first opened.  Still a solid and easy BBQ and meat option just not enough to go 4 stars even.  The meat is good.  The sides are what has declined. Their biscuits aren't that great - a little too dense.  Nice selection of desserts."}
{"input": "I have been bringing my dog Taz here for the past 3 years. This staff is absolutely amazing. They have always been accommodating to me since day one because of my hours at work. Pricing is great and their work is second to none. Facility is always clean and welcoming. My dog Taz, is always happy to visit the Grooming Room. Keep up the great work and thank you!"}
{"input": "This place is the epitome of a great hole in the wall find.  From  the  70s vintage floral upholstery  to the back entrance off the alley, it undersells it self and sets you up for a great surprise.  The food is good -- not fancy, not at all pretentious - but good. \n\nA group from work made the trek on the coldest day of the year and we were rewarded for our efforts -- the chicken hot pot was the best example this dish I have ever had.  The seafood dish with shrimp, scallops and squid was very generous for the price of about $10. The beef in black bean sauce was nice and spicy.  \n\nI will certainly return, but only with adventurous companions."}
{"input": "The food was fantastic, the staff for happy hour and table service were above and beyond wonderful. We had the local yogurt and house granola plate, shrimp n grits (an egg accidentally jumped onto the floor and they were so kind to whip up another quickly), oysters all ways. \n\nHowever, and a big however is the take-out experience. We opted to run downstairs from the hotel, cause the menu was bigger than room service. We ordered two soups, two salads, a dessert.....we got two salads, one soup, no utensils. When I called back, the lady seemed a bit skeptical. Really! So we ran back down for the missing items and alas still no utensils, soooo we ran back down again. Bothersome, unapologetic, and ended our eating there."}
{"input": "Walked into the restaurant, with reservations, and many open tables.  I asked the manager for a window table and was responded with \"they are all reserved.\"  Two hours later, when we left, still many open tables next to the windows.\n\nOverall food was good.\nI had the filet and she had the salmon.\nThe bottle of wine that was recommended was $75 and was not told prior to ordering it, just that it was the last bottle."}
{"input": "My order was 75% wrong and when I got home to divvy out the food I had ordered, items were missing including a burger"}
{"input": "I heard of this place and meant to try it for a long time, but was too poor to go. But then I heard they have half-price (select) sushi on weekdays! So of course we had to go try it out. \n\nThe only thing I'd complain about is that the wait for the sushi bar is really long. You can't sit at the Teppan Yaki tables if you're only getting sushi and the sushi bar seats only a couple of people. \n\nThe sushi was pretty good, although some rolls could have been made better. They were obviously in a rush since they had so many customers and so the service wasn't that great. But for $19 (not including tax + gratuity) we got 4 rolls and 4 pieces of nigiri. Overall pretty good for my sushi cravings when I'm on a tight budget."}
{"input": "We have stayed here four other times.  The rooms are well appointed and very well. Coffee is available in the lobby.  Water with. Citrus is always in the lobby.  Valet parking in a secured site on premise.  The hotel is on the national register of historic places.  The courtyards are beautiful.  The gardens are beautiful.  The beds and linens are great!!"}
{"input": "Service great, upstairs bar great, pool area nice. Bed mediocre, pillows mediocre, no on demand or movie rentals available, only one elevator working so lots of waiting. Super close to beach, and nice views."}
{"input": "After reading the reviews we decided to give Jesse's a try and sadly it didn't really meet our expectations.  The service was great but the food was mediocre; the steak was bland and the shrimp cocktail was nasty.  I had high hopes for this place but wouldn't recommend it to any one looking for asking for a good place to eat."}
{"input": "It's a relatively small space, there are maybe only 7 tables inside. They have vegetarian options! I tried the spicy Sichuan chili fat noodles and it was not that spicy for me (they said it was the spiciest item on their menu but it's not too spicy). It was good, but slightly bland. My friend got the other dish I don't remember the name of (refer to photo), but it was really good. My food would get 3 stars (quite average) but friend's bowl was better, and the service was prompt and wonderful."}
{"input": "We were really hoping to find a very good, local Vietnamese restaurant ...unfortunately this is not it! After reading the glowing reviews of other diners we had high hopes...but after our mediocre meal I thought maybe we had stumbled into the wrong place. The decor was nonexistent, bathroom filthy, and our appetizer was served after our main courses. If the food was excellent I could overlook all that...but the food was very disappointing. We won't be back...and our search continues for a good Vietnamese meal."}
{"input": "Miami doesn't have good BBQ spots!  I'm typically not a BBQ lover... However, this place was amazing!!  Best brisket I've had in a long time!!  Order it lean ;)"}
{"input": "Service was so poor we didn't even get to the food. New Years Day 2017 around 7:30 and we get seated. It's 8:15 now and we still don't have water and multiple waiters have introduced themselves to us saying they're going to be our server for the evening. After wasting 45 mins and repeated attempts to get water for the largest party in the small restaurant we walked out and went across the street to Dat Dog and were blown away by hot dogs. Thanks Dat Dogs!"}
{"input": "Food is creative and original. Wouldn't think so but the portions are very large. I would give 5 stars but the service has been inconsistent the 4 or 5 times we have been there. If you like Mexican but are tired of the same old stuff give this place a try. A bit more expensive but worth the experience."}
{"input": "I've been here several times. The price is reasonable, food is quite good, and the service as well. I've always ordered take-out. One time I went, and the guy who normally takes my order wasn't there... Instead there were 2 ladies... I think one was the wife of the owner. Or something along those lines. Anyway they were nice but when I came back to pick up my order they handed me the wrong bag (someone else's order). They should have confirmed the contents, but frankly I should have as well, so I accept at least part of the blame. I ended up going all the way home before I realized the screw-up and came back. I wasn't angry but I was definitely hungry and super-annoyed. The two ladies were gracious and apologetic, and they even threw in a courtesy snack for my trouble."}
{"input": "We eat out alot and had heard extremely good things about Porcini.  A pet peeve of ours is making us wait for table when there are a bunch in the room.  It was odd to have that happen, not a show stopper though.  They take their time throughout the meal (not TOO long, but it's a nice pace to let you talk with friends for an evening out).  Nice atmosphere. The food was very good, you will leave not too stuffed, but just right.  Homemade Ravioli are extremely good.  Worth the trip to try a new restaurant - be sure to bring Yelp's $20 coupon.  ENJOY!"}
{"input": "There is a great selection of whiskey/bourbon to suit anyone's taste. We had burgers with the fried egg on it and it was soo good and probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. The duck fries are a MUST if you come here. It is a cute atmosphere although we went with a party of 4 and it was a tad awkward the way our seating was and made it difficult to have conversation with everyone at our table. Overall, a nice place to go. We will be going back."}
{"input": "Venus nail is great. I was looking for a new salon and googled some in my area. I've been 3 times now and they've been amazing. Great atmosphere and service. Ask for Ivy she's fantastic. I told her I was going on a trip for my bday and to come up with something. I walked out with this and loved it all."}
{"input": "Although the chicken is always very good, there was a \"sulky\" male employee on Sunday, Jan 1 with a puss-face putting my package together 16 pc grilled chicken meal.  Out in the open he was complaining about work.  Honestly, if he doesn't like working there or the pay, the manager should allow him to make a decision, change his attitude or leave.  This doesn't leave customers with a positive feeling about the place, especially when he didn't load all that was supposed to be in my order.  Where's the rolls/biscuits?  Pay attention, it doesn't cost anything."}
{"input": "We shared the volcano nachos and they were pretty tasty. My son got wings and he enjoyed them. We had to sit upstairs and it kinda took away from the scene. I would have rather been downstairs with the live music. I enjoyed the Margarita flight and it did not disappoint."}
{"input": "Fun place to go to catch up with friends! Pretty setting and have yet to be disappointed with food. A little pricey but the food always seems quality. Had the small goat cheese salad, tiny but ate up every single bit of it! Then shared cheesesteak egg rolls, served with a horseradish sauce that was mild and not too overpowering. Finished off with my favorite dessert! Warm Banana bread\nPudding! They took it off the menu for about 6 months but now it's back! \n\nParking is tight. You can make reservations through yelp, the weekends get very busy so do it while you can! Valet available for 5 dollars but at catelli."}
{"input": "Came to Smiley's after reading other Yelp reviews, and I was not disappointed! I ordered the beef gyro platter to go, and the portion was well worth the money. Myself and another person split the meal, and there was still some left over. The gyro meat is cut off of a huge slab right in front of you. Don't let its appearance put you off: it's delicious. The rice is delicious and doesn't feel heavy or greasy like some that I've had from other establishments in the past. With the platter you also get a huge helping of hummus and a bag full of delicious pita, and a little salad on the side. I'll definitely be back here to try some of the other menu items. I definitely need to try the baklava."}
{"input": "One of the best and friendliest Chinese places to grab something tasty. Try the double treasure."}
{"input": "Other than the non-parallel construction of the restaurant name, which annoyed my grammatically minded girlfriend, The Farm and Fisherman got everything right. \n\nThe chef revises the menu every night based on what ingredients are fresh. All of the appetizers were tempting, but my girlfriend and I decided to start with a plate of mushrooms and a 24 hour roasted squash. The chef later told us that the mushrooms had been recently gathered by forager in rural Pennsylvania who had to sleep out in his car for two nights. The effort was worth it, we really enjoyed.\n\nWe shared a middle course of slow cooked tuna and then moved onto a steak and a chicken for our main course. Overall, the food was probably the best I have ever had in Philadelphia.\n\nThe restaurant is small, but manages to feel cozy rather than cramped. Assuming that I am able to get another reservation, I will be back."}
{"input": "I used to be a regular here when I lived close by. After moving away from the area I've been searching for quality sushi ever since.\nI've found good sushi in various places, but have always found them somewhat lacking. Over time I guessed nostalgia was overwhelming my objective opinion and Kaisen was probably not as wonderful as my memory told me.\nSo imagine my delight when I revisited and found that it was not nostalgic remembrances but actual fact!\n \nThe sushi was as good, maybe even better than I remembered, the service the same.\n\nThis is without doubt my favorite sushi restaurant, not just in Tampa bay but anywhere.\n\nFrom now on when the sushi craving craving strikes I'll make the effort and drive 40 minutes to enjoy the real deal."}
{"input": "I was greated by a nice friendly staff. There wasnt a long wait for my food. I ordered a chicken bacon croissant with chipolte sauce. They cut it in half as requested and was served in maybe only 20 seconds after the time it took to cook. Food taste great"}
{"input": "The new Bacon-Bleu cheeseburger is excellent! Probably one of the best fast food burgers I've had in a while! Dave Thomas would be proud!"}
{"input": "This place is insane! Amazing selection of anything you could possibly want! Fresh coffee bar, gelato, pastries, cheeses, wines, sliced meats, fresh homemade pastas & sauces, I could go on for a while... You need to go here!"}
{"input": "Ok so this is my favorite resturant but the staff is so immature. I want to have a date night and get away from crazy teens but that's exactly what I get with the servers. Get some people in there that need the jobs and will take them serious."}
{"input": "I ordered a big order to go from them and it was my first time as well. They called me to make sure they got it right and were super nice and helpful! The food was your typical kurdish/middle eastern plate, but extremely delicious! You can tell it was fresh and well made! My boys and i loved it so much, we will definitely order from there again!"}
{"input": "I took my car in for a 36,000-mile check up. I made an appointment online. My car was done in about 30 minutes. Everyone I encountered was extremely pleasant and friendly. I left smiling. I am very happy with this service department. Free snacks and drinks by the TV and free wifi. Free car wash with repair/service, too!"}
{"input": "I've been here numerous times but last time was seriously the best. The area under my shoulder blade had me near tears for a week. I even had 2 other massages that did nothing for me!  Almost immediately I felt relief. The next day was even better! Cured the pain!"}
{"input": "It was always great service by really cool people. Pizza is like the one I had in Trieste, Italy. I would recommend this place to anyone who likes good pizza."}
{"input": "I love this place. Best sushi in Tampa. The staff is always friendly and dies a great job. I've never had a bad experience here. You can sit at the bar and watch them create your meal or a table. They have free WiFi so you can make it a working meal. \nThey do deliver which is another bonus.  I've had them deliver several times and the online system is a little clunky and one time we had a rude experience when the driver couldn't figure out how our condo gate worked."}
{"input": "GOTH! Thats what this store is all about.  I went in for curiosities sake because I am no goth. If your into Marlyn Manson dripped in leather and death this is the place for you.  I gave it 2 stars because I really can't stand goth but mostly because everything was OUTRAGEOULSY priced."}
{"input": "Great place to grab some casual brunch and a latte on a Sunday. I recommend the veggie bagel and the chai latte. The biscuits and gravy are also on point. Thanks Henry's I'll be back!"}
{"input": "Been pumping iron here for years. Love the new location. Great rates, and a nice facility to get your sweat on.  I really appreciate the community feeling I get from the staff and people who work out here.  Keep up the good work E F."}
{"input": "I don't know what all the negativity is about this hotel. I was extremely impressed by the staff and the room. It was under $100 and the guy at the front desk helped us find a great restaurant down the street. I will definitely stay here again when I come back to this town."}
{"input": "FOOD IS AMAZING! And the service is great! I had breakfast and an item from the daily specials menu and they did not disappoint. They were busy at 11 AM and our food was still out in less than 10 minutes. Will come back here again for sure!!"}
{"input": "This place is worth it! Stop in and try it you won't regret it. I am not a big meat eater but I do love some good BBQ at times. I had the burnt ends and it was awesome! I've been here 3x now and each time was great! Portion sizes are large enough to share. Nice place to eat in or take out."}
{"input": "Took 45 minutes to get the order. Everyone that came in after seemed to get their food before us. Both the burger and the onion rings were cold when i got it, felt like chewing through rubber. After letting them know they did let us have the burgers for free."}
{"input": "I have had slight tightness, sore lower back..& i didn't want it to progress into herniated discs...so I Was referred to This practice & a Dr. Patrick Donahue.My 1st time ...so He looked familiar as he goes to my gym.Nice guy, early 30's..he asked me 1st  time,And I said YES, \" are you apprehensive?\" I said, Oh no..love getting my back cracked!!! LOL He said well..being your in shape..it wont bother you. He put these sensors on my back felt like 1,000 fingers loosening me up for approx. 10-15 min..it was great! then took me to another room..for the Cracking to commence.  he told me my pelvis bone was off, one side sat higher, other lower, this made one leg shorter then the other, as it protects the nerves, when its off, why I was feeling the tightness & soreness in lower lumber. After the session, he told me be tender & sore..but like all things my body getting used to it. Going again tonight -Yeah Back!!!."}
{"input": "I would eat here every day if it was a little cheaper. Fourth time here and I've never had a bad experience."}
{"input": "Pretty yummy! The chicken is great. I am a little fussy about fresh cut fries and mine would have been better if they were a little crispier. My only issue was WHAT - no BBQ sauce? They have a chipotle BBQ but no regular or sweet. I will be back, but for drive-thru only so I can bring it home to my Sweet Baby Ray's."}
{"input": "Fantastic tacos and salads. Best part of getting stranded in Philly when our flight was canceled. I wish there was one in Vermont! Enjoy!"}
{"input": "This might be one of my favorite places of all time, not just in Philadelphia.  Luckily, our winter has had an identity crisis, bringing warmer days to the region.  This means more days to enjoy the trail.  \n\nThe trail has many offshoots so if the paved trail is a bit too easy for you, you can up the difficulty.  On a recent trip, I took the beau across the river to the rockier terrain.  The roots, rocks, and fallen trees were not our friends and I am sure he is still angry at me.  Maybe I will leave that for solo trips.  \n\nOn more leisurely trips, I have enjoyed to historical plaques to help point out noteworthy Philadelphia facts - like how we had the first water fountain (on the trail) and about the Lenape warrior statue.\n\nWhatever your fitness level, the Wissahickon Trail is a good place to burn calories without feeling like you are burning calories."}
{"input": "Gave them another try today ... SMDH .... how does this place stay open .... customer service non existent always out of something or something not working ... really don't know how they even stay open .. I would be embarrassed to own this location"}
{"input": "After trying to talk Thai with Chef & waitress so I tried it here but\ncome out super...disappointed :(\nOkay their menu has variety noodle styles to choose\nbut not even one item that we love.\n\nie. we ordered (SUPER spicy) somtom came out just a plain salad on top with dipping sauce from the bottle, curry tasted suck even my white folks said so :(\n\nDon't get me wrong, this restaurant may great for some local clients\nbut I won't recommend you trying if you seeking for authentic Thai taste."}
{"input": "Dr. McCrady and Staff are top notch!! When my fur grand baby moved from SD to Tucson with serious medical issues Dr. McCrady has had all the best medical advice , treatment and care available for our boy!  Dr. McCrady and staff have been there for us many times and each time with love and compassion! Those that have reviews stating they are a little pricey (disagree), BUT ... well you get what you pay for and we have been given the BEST of care to our family! We will not go any where else! \nThank you Dr. McCrady and VCA Valley Animal Hospital!!!"}
{"input": "Connor was an awesome server, had a wonderful singing voice, and a great hair cut to top it off. For starters we had the nachos. Might I say muy bien fantastico!!!!!! I'm serious- out of this world. Heaping scoop of guacamole on top of a mountain of nachos. Then for my entree I had the burrito bowl. Wow didn't think it could get better after the nachos....guess what...I thought wrong! The chicken was cooked to perfection. Then our cutie patootie of a server brought us out fried ice cream- hit the spot! Thanks Connor. !! We'll be back before you can say 'ayyeeee que lindo'"}
{"input": "This is the best gym I've ever been a member of. It's clean, up to date, huge, bright and fun. The machines are top of the line and the staff is always friendly. Just stay away on Mondays! There are no parking spots and no available machines. \nThe only bad thing is the love songs they play on the sound system. I mean really, we're there to get pumped up and workout not listen to sappy love songs that just slow down your rhythm and mood!"}
{"input": "Holy Donuts Batman!! One of my favorite spots for a quick sandwich and some delicious fries. Of course, being famous for their amazing donuts I have to sample a different one each time I visit. They are excellent! Also, have a coffee drink with your donut. Treat yo self!!"}
{"input": "A typical budget motel, but the rooms are very clean with no bugs. Great price for the room. I broke down and was scrambling to find a room, and the two gentlemen at the desk were kind and accommodating.  I would definitely stay here again."}
{"input": "I love this place. I have tried to limit myself to one visit a week. I usually grab it to go, and its fast. Staff are super cool - I found out the hard way they dont take credit cards, but was able to settle up on my next visit.\n\nAlways pick two options, chili cheese etouffe and something else. Parking can be a struggle, but you can usually find a place on College Avenue. \n\nGreat food all around, cheap, and fast."}
{"input": "The Food here is bomb.com on Wednesday they have 1.00 jumbo wings and they are really good and seasoned just right. The drink i fell in love with is the Dirty Lemonade, If you're in Indianapolis come visit this place."}
{"input": "I have been to this place more than 3 times for family events and we always had a good dining experience there. They offer great food, live tango music and they are kid's friendly. \nThe only downside from my last visit, was the beer. It wasn't very cold but after I let the waiter knows, he prompted to take care of the those and make sure they were cold after we order a second bottle."}
{"input": "I wanted to be tattooed by a woman, and heard a lot of positive feedback about Jamie Ruth at Treasure Tattoo. My tattoos are works of art and I am stopped by strangers everyday who want to check them out. I am beyond grateful to have these on me, but another wonderful thing about spending so much time getting tattooed by Jamie Ruth is that we became friends. Treasure Tattoo usually has installations by local artists and the owner definitely generates a sense of community in her shop. I miss living in that town and being able to just drop in and say hello. If you're in New Orleans and want to get a tattoo, this is a great place to do it. The other resident artist Stacy Colangelo, also does amazing work."}
{"input": "I've been here many times, usually for the lunch buffet and twice for dinner.\n\nThe dinners were very good, freshly prepared and tasty.\n\nHowever, the buffet, originally was very good, lots of variety, especially for Veggies.  In the more recent visits, the buffet has gone down hill.  It does not have as many varieties for Veggies, the Nann was cold & stale, the soup container was empty.\n\nIn previous visits, the staff was very friendly and accommodating.  On this recent visit, no smiles, welcoming, etc. - we were just seated, given our beverages and said to go to the buffet.\n\nI wouldn't rule them out and would certainly try them again, if in the area.  But I would try to search out another Indian Restaurant for comparison in King of Prussia."}
{"input": "I remember being wheeled in the basket by my mother across this parking lot as a child 40+ years ago.  So happy that they are still around and better than ever.  Dorignacs has by far the best produce, meats and liquor selection and prices.  They also have hard to find items that you cannot find anywhere else. The bakery is amazing, the glazed donuts and canolis are the best.  They also have Turtles.  YUM! \nThey are upgrading the layout and have recently given it a facelift to keep it fresh looking.  I also like that when you are there almost every isle is staffed with a checkout person."}
{"input": "Asked my husband on his way home this evening from work to stop by Taco Bell to grab me an order of Nachos Bell Grande with Chicken and guacamole. So he brought it home and I was excited to eat it, as I started digging through all this goodness I realized there were only but 6-7 whole chips in this entire plate, the rest were a bunch of bits and pieces of chips, sort of the last bits at the bottom of the bag/container. I would hope whoever assembled this plate of nachos would realize that the bits and pieces of chips defeats the entire purpose of this meal. Disappointed:/ hopefully they can do better."}
{"input": "For an old fashioned restaurant, this place is truly ahead of its time! Highly recommend! Plenty of other reviews and pics of this place that I don't need to say anymore about it. When in St Louis...you gotta go here!!!"}
{"input": "It turns out that Kehoe Tire, previously referred to me as \"that little tire shack on Freret\" handles more than just tires. My car wouldn't start recently and I was desperate to get it fixed immediately. I took it to Kehoe Tire at the suggestion of a friend. Despite being told that there were 21 cars ahead of me, my car was diagnosed in exactly 24 hours and I soon left a satisfied customer. Of course, prices on parts are marked up, but overall prices are reasonable and the service is good and quick. The next time you're having car trouble and you're desperately searching Yelp for help, know that Kehoe Tire is a good choice."}
{"input": "A lot of fun, even though I'm terrible at putt putt golf! LOL!"}
{"input": "Nice brunch spot while visiting with our son for WUSTL parents weekend.  Strada too salty for great ingredients to reveal their flavor, but Bananas Foster French Toast was enjoyed by all.  Coffee was fair."}
{"input": "Food was incredible! Wine was delicious! Service was awesome!!\n\nStarters: Kale salad was good. Ahi bites -- amazeballs.\n\nMains: Beef Bourguignon was excellent and so soft and flavorful. Sea Bass in parchment paper -- top ten fish dishes ever in my life! It was sooo good!\n\nDesert: Creme brulee - delicious! \n\nWe had the rose, chard, pinot and cab - all very delicious! We sat at the tables in the bar section and it was extremely delightful with a chill ambiance. We had our 8 month old son and that area was perfect with him! Kyle, the bartender, took great care of us! I highly recommend you going in and he will totally take care! Can't wait to go back! Yum!"}
{"input": "five stars because it is a casino. They have lots of slots.. everything from a nickel and UP! I play the unicorn slot machine because it reminds me of the unicorns, my favorite band. I usually walk away with the same amount of $ I spent-- I make enough to buy a round of drinks.\n\nBrittney Mullen is the best cocktail waitress. She is the fastest and nicest cocktail waitress ever. Request her many times."}
{"input": "Outstanding place. The food is always great. Prices are fair. The only problem is the line. The line is always out the door. I guess that speaks to how good the place is though."}
{"input": "Got the early bird special of steak and fries - subbed mashed potatoes, added broccoli. Asked for butter on the side for broccoli, but that didn't happen. The sirloin was good, but cooked well done when I ordered it medium. These couple of flubs make the difference between a 4&5 star rating to me. I ordered a glass of the one hope cab sav and it was quite delicious - sweet and spicy, not too dry. \n\nThe carrot cake here is to die for - definitely save room and get it. Amazingly delicious!"}
{"input": "Delicious!  Came here with my family and they accommodated a large group of us last minute.  Great food, very authentic Taiwanese cuisine.  We had the 3 cup chicken, pan fried seafood noodles, soup dumplings, string beans, some sort of greens with garlic sauce which were outstanding, soup dumplings, scallion pancakes ... all were delicious and authentic according to my brothers Taiwanese girlfriend."}
{"input": "Construction on the sidewalks is underway on this section of Grand, getting to Mojo's tonight I felt like the frog in Frogger trying to navigate through traffic just to cross the street.  \n\nThe hubby and I shared a large Spinach Salad, topped with smoked bacon, red onion, goat cheese, cornbread croutons and balsamic.  The cornbread croutons were freaking amazing.  I want to duplicate this salad at home it was so good.  \n\nI ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork Pizza with apples, onions and bleu cheese.  The combination of BBQ with bleu cheese was really good.  The hubby ordered the 8oz Mojo Burger with Chipotle BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, topped with crispy red onion rings and shoe string fries.  The fries didn't do anything for me but the burger was pretty good.  \n\nI think next time I'd lobby for the Slider Sampler Plate.  The sampler is your choice of any 3 sandwiches, they are a smaller version of the original sandwich size."}
{"input": "Not a great vibe, employees were pretty rude minus the bartender, and all in all probably will never go back."}
{"input": "Best pizza around. You could order anything and it will come out perfect. Everything is made fresh, and the pizza is the best. The calamari is one of our favorite sides, as well as ordering the white pizza. I reccommend this to anyone looking for a delicious meal to eat!"}
{"input": "This is not Middle Eastern food. Side dishes were awfully tasting, including a warmed up rice, which I am sure came from a frozen bag few minutes before it was served."}
{"input": "The food at this Qdoba was standard, but the service was horrible!  There were three people behind the counter and none of them wanted to help customers.  There was no one in line, and two of the three just kept standing at the sink talking to each other even after the third employee tried to call over the person working the first station.  We waited and waited, and a line of 3 other couples built up before the gentleman at the first station finally sighed loudly and walked to his station."}
{"input": "Best margaritas around, freshly made (not concentrate or artificial tasting sour mixes) from real limes. Best of all, only $5 at late night or after-work happy hour.  Definitely my new favorite special.\n\nGuacamole is awesome and the spicy salsa they serve it with adds the perfect kick. I also had the squid hot-pot which was tasty, but I could probably eat dinners here of just the guac."}
{"input": "I was looking for sushi and was very intrigued with the 5 stars on yelp that I had to check it out. OMG, I wasnt dissappointed! From appetizers to desserts it was do good! For 2 people, I recommend just getting 1 of each appetizers to share. The long rolls are 10 pcs, if they are not busy, ask for half rolls in order to try other samples. The desserts were great too, although it would have been better to use sticky or sweet rice instead of sushi rice. Overall another great recommendation from my fellow yelpers!"}
{"input": "Good service and good food. Plenty of seating room and there's a ton of tvs for all the sports fans. I had a grouper sand which and it was outstandingly good!"}
{"input": "Great place for comedy with A list performers for a reasonable price without having to drive all the way to LA."}
{"input": "Nice view from outside tables. It has typical beach food and typical beach service, but nice place to grab a drink with a view."}
{"input": "The Wellington holds a special place in my heart.  I want to carve it (the welly, not my heart) out and put it on the corner at the end of my street.  Sure I'll make the trek up every so often for a visit, but Broad Ripple really isn't my scene... I'd rather eat an entire bag of cool ranch doritos in my underwear while watching any CBS sitcom than spend a weekend evening there. \n\nLuckily they have pint nights on Tuesday and Wednesday night (the slowest and least annoying evenings in BR) -- Rejoice! ($3.50 pints I believe) \n\nA warm and cozy enclave with old school dart boards and front door that reads \"Public Bar.\"  Throw in an excellent regional craft beer list and we are nearing perfection. My only real issue is the allowance of smoking, but hell.. I'll deal with that every now and then."}
{"input": "I just can't understand the number of positive reviews on the place. I try the place about every six months because it is in my neighborhood and I want to like it, but I just can't past the overall mediocrity of the place. I have tried many of the dishes and overall the food is basic, bland in taste, portions on the small side and skimpy on the vegetables as well as the meat, and the service is clueless. My vegetarian friends even leave the Mesa for Thai food. Zen Yai on State Street is way better and worth the 5 minute drive off the hill. I keep hoping the place will close and we get a good Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"input": "$1 PBRs until 6pm - can't  beat that plus live music! Very talented artists playing. The bar reminds me of a local joint, although it's in the middle of broadway. No cover, great to to stop in during late afternoon. Will update if I get a chance to come at night!"}
{"input": "I'm fussy about breakfast places. I have to say, I don't know of a better place to go.  Service is super fast, the portions are the right size and everything tastes fresh.  The home fries are not super greasy like other places, the scrambled eggs are always cooked perfectly, bacon is thick and cooked right and the pancakes are awesome! We have been there a couple of times and I have not been disappointed.\n\nForget the big impersonal chains. For a great LOCAL place, come here."}
{"input": "Delicious crab cocktail and my husband loved his steamers. \n\nOnly down fall is it is really humid in the restaurant itself. A fan would be nice."}
{"input": "I came last night for the first time in awhile and was pleasantly surprised at the upgraded menu!!!! They now serve a variety of burritos, salads, and quesadillas, and even nachos! I tried the surf n turf burrito and my friend got the grilled steak quesadilla-- they were both delicious!!! To top it off, I tried their horchata. HANDS DOWN THE BEST IN IV. it cannot compare to freebirds or elsewhere!! I will be back!"}
{"input": "Our group very much enjoyed our meal. Our whole family got together as a group and went there and everyone liked their food. I got the Smokey Pit Beef sandwich and my wife got the Chicken Panini. Both were very good!  They are only open for breakfast and lunch, and aren't open for dinner.  We'll definitely be back! If you are looking for a good place to have a business lunch downtown, this would be a good place to go too!"}
{"input": "We had a lovely brunch on a cold, rainy Sunday. The staff was extremely friendly, the atmosphere was bright and classy, and the food was delicious. We will definitely try Nathalie's again, next time for dinner!"}
{"input": "If you're a beer snob, this is definitely a place to check out. If you kinda like beer, once again, a must see. If you happen to hate beer, (I'm questioning your existence) there is an amazing food and cocktail list that will surely get your attention. They amount of beer they have on tap is impressive but the selection of bottles, well that's nothing short of mind boggling. I had flank steak sandwich. The goat cheese and garlic aioli sent that bad boy into outer space! Steak was a little overcooked and tough, but it's to be expected from that cut. Upgraded to the loaded tots for my side.  I'm glad I did! They were outstanding."}
{"input": "Our son & his wife sent us the heart shaped box of chocolate covered strawberries with a 'Happy Anniversary' balloon for our 50th wedding anniversary this past Saturday. The store called to make sure we were home, the driver wished us a happy anniversary and the strawberries are still delicious and keeping well in the fridge. I would definitely send these to someone else. Well worth the price."}
{"input": "Best tempura and teriyaki chicken ever!!! Tempura banana and green tea ice cream the best!!!"}
{"input": "They have a super yummy menu priced really well. My favorite part is the outdoor bar/sitting area. Love the couches and fire pits! Music is great, line-dancing on the weekends and live music sometimes too! The bartenders are awesome, great drink specials. And their bloody mary's are AMAZING, made with their BBQ sauce, so good! My favorite menu item is the BBQ chicken pizza!"}
{"input": "They have a couple of really nice ladies, that go out of their way to help you. But there's one that will rip your head off if you're not careful. It won't take ya long to figure this out on your own though.  Jus' sayin'......"}
{"input": "I noticed Panaderia Mi Linda Guatemala and stuck my nose in out of curiosity.  The man behind the counter was so sweet, I decided to give the place a try.  Baked goods were fresh; in fact, he was actively bringing trays out of the oven when I was there.  There were a variety of traditional Guatemalan choices available...breads, cakes, pastries, and cookies. A Guatemalan couple I met there recommended the cake and cookies with coffee, which was also available. I enjoyed the items I tried. I loved the owner...what a doll!  There was seating available, and plenty of lot parking.  Very casual atmosphere."}
{"input": "We are fans of Target.  They seem to have a little better quality over Walmart.  This Target is easy to get to from the U of A.  When we have errand to run while we are over by the university we tend to stop by and pick up what we need here.\n\nThis Target happens to be one of the oldest and smallest in town.  That being said they tend to have a smaller selection.  The cafe now seems to be closed every time we go in.  Be careful when schools starts this place is packed.  On the plus side the restrooms are clean and the staff is friendly."}
{"input": "Love this place. Awesome tacos always friendly staff. The chorizo and pollo verde are my favorite. The bowls are pretty good also. Freshly made. I've only been to the 4th st location but would imagine DTSP is the same."}
{"input": "Let me be the first to begin with the statement I would be incredibly surprised that Yoichi's is not on Michelin's radar. \n\nIncredible experience: The ingenuity, the flavor, the precision, the plating, and the service were flawless.\n\nI've read other reviews as to ambience and it puzzles me as the beauty in Japanese style and aesthetics is about simplicity. It further underscores that with simplicity as the backdrop, the food can truly be the hero of the moment as described above.\n\nThe only heartbreak of the evening is that we discovered the Chef and his lovely proprietor wife  lived in San Francisco. So my city lost a jewel; nevertheless, happy for Santa Barbara for their new found treasure.  \n\nPromise you this: My Chef partner and I will not be waiting until another birthday to enjoy in the delight of Yoichi's."}
{"input": "Delicious plates! Well stocked bar and a nice array of beers make this Rustic corner spot a must go to. You can tell the chef has a great grasp of food and also a wonderful, exciting and colorful concept for their dishes. Happy hour specials are great too!"}
{"input": "This is a great place to stay. I picked it because of the full kitchen, it was very helpful. We didn't spend as much money on food. Its very clean and cute!"}
{"input": "Cashiers are fast & efficient. Coffee always fresh and hot. I like that they have a large variety of coffees.. Employees are  friendly. The store is always clean."}
{"input": "Chris is the best, he goes above and beyond for his customers. He treats both his customers and his employees with respect. He's very good at problem solving and keeping long term costumers"}
{"input": "Yats rocks. You walk in and they've got 4-6 cauldrons full of your choices...which are written in sidewalk chalk on a blackboard. There's always something vegetarian, and a plate full of any of it costs five fitty. Add a buck and you can get a split plate of 2 delectable cajun creations with rice. But the best part is the ridiculously awesome garlic bread...which you can get a bowl of for like a buck.\n\nNot only is the food awesome, but the owner (Joe Vuskovich) is a local celebrity. He's a famed restaurateur from New Orleans that sells his secret spice to restaurants everywhere. Everybody in town knows him (despite the fact that there are two other locations) and he's highly supportive of local bands and kids that most older people stay away from."}
{"input": "Stopped for a very healthy burger while visiting Philly after performing a nearby Prince tribute show; discovered one of the greatest burger places on planet earth! Thank you Alya & company at Bareburger!! \n(-: \n\nAndrew von Gregor \nPro Session & Touring Guitarist \nLos Angeles"}
{"input": "Wonderful place, if you haven't checked it out!  Went there for a pizza making class.  Had a great time, learned some great techniques (thanks to John from Ornesto), and met some really great people.  This place is the Disneyland for bakers, chefs and wanna be chefs.  I already signed up for another class in January and I purchased several of their store goods.  Check it out.  It's a little hard to find, as the lighting is a little dim - or maybe it's me.  :-)"}
{"input": "Great customer service! Mary was a great help- helped me pick out frames and she was extremely personable! From the time I walked in the store, I was greeted with smiles and hellos! I will be back in the future!"}
{"input": "For authentic, fresh and flavorful Mexican food, you have to go to Las Cazuelas. The enchiladas, Mole, and Mole Enchiladas are fantastic. The Horchata and Mexican Coffee are excellent drinks. It gets major points for being BYOB. The meats are so tender and the rice is perfectly cooked. The main reason for the perfect five stars is what topped the whole experience for me: the dessert. THE BEST DESSERT I'VE EVER EATEN. EVER. You MUST order the Cheesecake Bunuelos!!! It will blow your mind. I will forever be returning to Las Cazuelas."}
{"input": "Tons of food. Went for a graduation party. Very good flavors. Wasabi fries are a must"}
{"input": "My brother lives in Santa Barbara and every time I visit him, I HAVE to go to the Paradise Cafe!! The food is amazing, the ambiance is classic Santa Barbara-style, and there always seems to be a lot of locals, which is a good sign. There are so many restaurant choices in SB, but I always go back to this place. You really can't go wrong with anything you order, but make sure you save room for the Paradise Pie! Best dessert on the planet!!!"}
{"input": "I went here based on the Yelp reviews and found everything to be true. The staff is extremely helpful and willing to answer all questions. I will continue to bring my bike repair/maintenance needs here."}
{"input": "This place quite simply has the best pho I've ever tasted, and I have had it all over the city. The crab rangoons were also pretty spectacular.  Other than that,  the service was prompt and accurate, despite the fact that the dining room quite literally was completely full within 10 minutes of our arrival. If you are looking for a quick, non-pretenious Vietnamese restaurant, this is the place for you."}
{"input": "Stopped simply because it looked cute and had a full parking lot on a Monday afternoon.  The meatloaf sandwich for $9.50 was two meals, and the special 8oz Angus burger was perfectly cooked and flavorful for only $6.  Our side was the prime rib mac and cheese and we shared a 2-4-1 hard cider since happy hour stars at 11am.  Chrissy was our server and you should definitely ask for her.  She knows the menu, she is efficient, keeps the drinks filled and nearly sold us on dessert even though we were just too full.  We will be back again for sure!  Hump day has 1/2 price appetizers too...Check out this local gem!"}
{"input": "Clean and well kept products. Good grill folks."}
{"input": "Moving and storing possessions important to you is a stressful process. I have found that Nicole is consistently professional, polite and helpful. This is a very busy business so sometimes there is a wait. What I've noticed is that both Nicole and Stacey take their time to make sure the paperwork is complete and that customers understand everything. If you have a short wait, just know that when it's your turn, they will give you the same undivided attention. Nicole has really helped me during a very stressful time. I really appreciate that."}
{"input": "Food is good but service is not good at all.. The guy who is working there is totally lazy and he won't come to ask you for water. Not worth it to go there.."}
{"input": "I tend to prefer local cupcake shops to fancy chains like Sprinkles, but unfortunately I must say that I prefer Sprinkles to The Flying Cupcakes.\nFirst, visually, the frosting-to-cupcake ratio is too small.  I like eating cake with frosting.  I don't want to eat too much of cake without frosting. \nSecond, I'm not a fan of having chocolate chips in my red velvet cake.  They overwhelm the flavor of cream cheese frosting. \nThird, and this is the biggest negative, the frosting does not melt in the mouth!  It's too thick and hard, which means when you eat the cake with the frosting, they do not mash well in the mouth to give the goodness of all the flavors melted together. You might as well eat them separately. \n\nI only tried their red velvet cupcake, and maybe their other flavors are better, but I think I make better cupcakes at home, and I have certainly had much better cupcakes from other stores.  I don't think they are worth my $3 or my time waiting in line.  Their window displays are cute though!"}
{"input": "Never has there been a more perfect example of \"Location, location, location\"\nThe wine is good, but seriously, who pays attention to the wine with a view like this??\nStunning, gorgeous, breathtaking...check, check, and check!\nI love this place. \nOnce you check it out, you'll understand why."}
{"input": "As motels go this one is very nice for the rate. Clean, comfortable and well-managed. You get what you pay for so the breakfast buffet is just OK. The pool is too small to swim laps (disappointing). The lobby area is spacious and comportable. \n\nIf you are looking for a moderately priced place to sleep that is clean and comforable this will suit you just fine."}
{"input": "If i could give this place a zero stars I would. What a waste of my time. We waited for a seat. Our server... female with dark hair... never told us her name...never brought us bread.... I asked her 3 times for plates when the other server finally brought us bread.  She screwed up my kid's calamari with no parsley on it and never put in my order or my husband's order...we literally sat there for over an hour with no food. I finally asked for the manager and he told us then that he was making our order the priority for the chef...I got up and walked out. Im a chef. I would never have sent calamari with something someone specifically asked for there to not be on it. The server put the calamari in as an appetizer even after i told her it was my daughter's diner. What a terrible experience...i will NEVER eat at this restaurant again..and i will tell Everyone I know what a horrible place this is!"}
{"input": "I have to get my prescriptions filled at CVS. As with any medical facility hand sanitizer should be offered to reduce transmission of disease.  There bottle of sanitizer has been empty for a week and I complained to the clerk who told me it is not for my use anyway.  I told her it should be because I am forced to use their disease ridden pen pad to sign for my prescriptions.  She then smugly said I was free to bring my own sanitizer.  I hate doing business with CVS and can't wait to transfer to Target."}
{"input": "I have been here twice now and both times have been fabulous. The first time I went was in early July with my mother.  We both had a great time and our paintings turned out great.  It was a great night with my mom.  The second time I went, my husband and I went to the Paint Your Pet event in support of the Nevada Humane Society.  We sent in pictures of our dogs a few weeks before the class and they had sketched out our pet on the canvas.  It was such a fund night and because everyone was painting something different - it was fun to walk around and look.  We will be back and I will continue to take friends and family there."}
{"input": "Recently visited on a Friday night and had a great meal and experience. Started with a white organic white- very nice for a \"green\" wine.\n\nOrdered the Banh Mi special and Mahi Tacos. Food was delicious. Real, wholesome ingredients. You can tell the owner and kitchen care about the food.\n\nEnjoyed the nice music on the well-put-together patio, too. \n\nWe'll definitely be back."}
{"input": "I had actually never been to a MB prior to this experience, but I'll keep it short and sweet. It was fine. I got an average sandwich with minimal expectations, knowing I was at a chain. I ordered egg white and turkey bacon on a pumpernickel bagel with a large coffee. Everything came out quick and was fine, it fit the bill for my morning. My major complaint would be that the coffee was just warm, which I loathe. The guy at the counter also looked super stressed out and annoyed even though there weren't really a lot of people to deal with. I'd hate to see what he'd be like during a busy morning! I wouldn't go back, but it wasn't a terrible experience."}
{"input": "First time at HS. It was difficult getting a reservation. It always is after great reviews from patrons and the most recent 3 star out of 4 from CL. HS really steps it up for Collingswood. Once inside if you close your eyes one would think they were in a major city in the US. Love the open kitchen. Beautiful inside and out. Now for the food. Kale salad with hazelnuts was fantastic. Even if you don't like kale you will love this. Next the octopus. Perfectly done and one of the best I have tasted. This next dish they hit it out of the park and should make it permanent on the menu. Pasta cups with red meat gravy aka bolognese sauce. It was so good and had a little spice to it. And last a table share of a pork shoulder that they crisped up which was fantastic. Believe it or not our friends made a reservation for this Wednesday so we can't wait to go back. Staff was great and steered us in the right direction for ordering. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!"}
{"input": "I can't speak for the food, but the drinks are great. What makes this little gem even more of a standout, are the employees. My boyfriend and I flew into for a quick weekend from Florida and this place was around the corner from our hotel. We were greeted  right away by John - one of the best bartenders I've ever had and had to pleasure of meeting. He made this place a standout. Kind, courteous and friendly. If we gained something more than a hangover from here, it was a friend I. Him. thanks for everything John!!!! You're the best!!!"}
{"input": "As Olive Garden restaurants go, this one is OK. We had a very short wait for a table -- probably would have been faster, but, they called us and then had to have a discussion about some nefarious drivel before seating us. We were seated in the large dining room in the back beside a table with a small child who was either ignored by the 4 adults at the table or encouraged to be \"cute\" by screeching loudly or banging her spoon on the table. I understand Olive Garden is a family restaurant, but seat all the \"families\" together and let couples with no children sit someplace else that is fairly quiet. To the 4 adults sitting at that table, shame on you! You are not doing that child any favors and the screeching was NOT cute and she was certainly old enough to know how to behave.\n\nThe food was good and our server was GREAT! She was very attentive, but not hovering. We would go back, but I'll put my foot down next time if we are shown to a table beside a small child!!"}
{"input": "Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a delicious meal at a reasonable price. The shrimp and goat cheese crepes are a must have!"}
{"input": "Staff was friendly, drinks were delicious, orders were fast and efficient, and prices are reasonable. Great place to grab a coffee!"}
{"input": "This place replaced Yo Mama's, which I really enjoyed. I must say it is a good replacement. I really loved the tasty and seasoned grilled chicken sandwich. It was delicious. Great location, too."}
{"input": "Spot on!\n\nI got \"the veg\" and the spicy fries.  \"The veg\" is a portabella burger, with grilled mozzarella, picked veg, arugula, and gauc.  Wholly non-cow is this thing spectacular for a bella burger!  The bella is on bottom, then the mozzarella is directly fused on top of that.  I actually thought the cheese was halloumi at first because it wasn't super melted (a good thing). The gauc and pickled veg are slightly citrusy and vinegary, but are contrasted by the bitterness of the arugula.  There's a nice bun to contents ratio, and for bonus points it's a potato bun.\n\nWasn't sure what to expect with the spicy fries going in - are they hot sauce fries, etc?  Turns out they are of the crab-fries variety with some subtle other spices added in.  Nice portion - not too big.\n\nThe atmosphere kind of reminds me of a dive bar - I think that's the best way to describe it.  It's pretty small, so I wouldn't choose to ever eat in most likely."}
{"input": "Nestled on the corner of 20th and Chestnut, it looks bigger than what you'll discover inside. A tight-knit community of tables, all filled, whether reservations can be made or not, saddled around a long bar, and some standing room to place your beer and food, if standing is fine. \n\nWander in at 6:00 on a Saturday, and are told its a 2 hour wait for a table. Bar is a much better option. Was able to grab a seat at the bar as soon as we got in. \n\nBartenders are friendly. The wall of whiskey (or whisky) behind the bar is quite impressive. \n\nFood is quite delicious. Village burger with sauteed onions and blue cheese is quite the tasty treat. Burger is cooked a shade under what you request, which for medium, a bit redder is fine by me. The wife got a pulled pork sandwich, and salivated over every bite. A side order of duck fat fries in a cheese sauce compliments the meal well. \n\nPricing is surprisingly reasonable. Definitely on the list as a repeat place to go."}
{"input": "This is my favorite Philly brunch spot. No doubt about it.\n\nWhen I used to have a car, I'd wake up early Saturday and Sunday mornings to get there before the crowds (get there before 9:00 and usually no wait). \n\nI get either the pancakes (especially when they have pumpkin pancakes) or the brisket/port tacos. All fantastic.\n\nStaff is great and hip (although a different kind of hip than the Silk Cafe hip staff).\n\nIf you think one of the other 'cheap' Philly brunch spots is better than this place (e.g., Sabrina's) then you're just friggen crazy."}
{"input": "Great Bbq and delicious sides. Al and company are friendly and attentive. Go on Fridays where they serve Mac and cheese that melts in your mouth."}
{"input": "Spice n Grill has the best Indian food in St. Louis. We had the beef nihari, palak paneer, and naan. The palak and beef were perfectly spiced, adequately spicy, and crave-worthy. I've never had a nihari dish before and I will be sure to try it again. \n\nThe restaurant doesn't have great seating  in the store, so I will take food to go next time. The owner served us and he was very nice, but I don't think people eat in the restaurant very often. \n\nI was so excited to see that the previous owners of 'Indian Food' have opened a new restaurant and I would recommend it if you're in the mood for delicious take-out."}
{"input": "This place is good. For the lofty prices the proportions were very small. However the drinks were cheap and the service was very good. The piano is a nice touch as well. \n\nThe cheesecake is incredible, just get it and don't look back."}
{"input": "Pretty good food! Definitely the best I've had in Santa Barbara. The restaurant needs some decoration and improved service but the food is great!"}
{"input": "This is our go-to takeout place. It has great food and exceptionally fast service. I live at 2601 Parkway and they deliver right to the door of my condo which many delivery places don't do. Their staff is friendly, make great pizza, and generally run such a business as best you can."}
{"input": "Located on lower level section by the Pool entry- offering predictable grease bombs, home of burgers and fries. If there are others in your party not wanting burgers go to the Café. \n\nOnion rings were great but could not substitute for fries in meal deal so had to order separately.  \nEvery 45min or so they turned up the music really loud for 1 song and staff (including manager) featured  dance/ choreography to entertain. \n\nTo sit sooner than later they split up my 8 person party to two tables, offering to move a table up to a booth when other customers finished; we were settled/resolved to it by then but it was nice they asked."}
{"input": "Hands down best fall off the bone BBQ I've ever had.Excellent pulled pork everything had that great smoky flavor.Very creamy mac and cheese.Service was fast and friendly. Dessert was equally as good walnut brownie and ice cream delight.Such a great find."}
{"input": "This hotel is beautiful on the inside, but not worth the price. I checked in only to have a dirty room. The sheets had something that looked like blood on them and the bathroom floor was extremely dirty. Not to mention there was left over trash on the desk. But I called the front desk and they gave me a different room and free breakfast which was good. Although the second room was clean, we had marijuana smoke seeping into our room from the vents. If I wanted to smell marijuana I would've checked into a motel. Therefore, for the amount I paid for the room, I expected the room to be emaculate and the environment to be a little more family friendly."}
{"input": "Great food! Very impressed...I really like the brunch on the weekends. Chicken and waffles very good, avocado toast."}
{"input": "Lobster Mac & Cheese is the ONLY reason it gets 2 stars.....service ALWAYS poor and depending who comes in before or after you, you can wait an eternity to be seated.  Not the place where EVERYONE is made to feel special.  Sad but true."}
{"input": "Excellent time here. Went late right before closing, 9:30, and the place was empty. The amazing waitress, Courtney ( I think ),  was very accommodating and even had the the cook take the heads off the shrimp at my request because it was slow. I really appreciated the hospitality here. Overall I would go again and get the boiling house sauce."}
{"input": "It's a flat fee sushi place - it has a big menu and good food for the concept - service was good. \nIt offers a decent beer and wine list too.  Good enough for the concept of all you can eat for just shy of $20/person."}
{"input": "I love this place. They have the best chicken gyros and gyros. Their pasta salad and is awesome and so is their hummus. Love the mural on the wall. I have eaten here about once a month for the past two years. Usually my in laws ordering to go and someone picks it up and brings it home. always awesome. Never a bad meal. BUT i would really suggest to the owners / workers for everyone to work on their customer service and attitude. Hence missing a star. A couple of times I have walked in 10 minutes before they close to get a to go order - they seemed annoyed. Other than that this place is ACES! If you go get the chicken gyro with a salad of pasta salad. go good! Everything is always crazy fresh tasting."}
{"input": "They had a rough start but we really enjoy eating here now.  The only complaint is that it seems \"smoky\" inside sometimes like the ventilation doesn't work properly in the kitchen."}
{"input": "Fruit + cheese + bread + protein = awesome sandwich. Chatham knows how to combine and meld yummy items together. All of their sandwiches are awesome. And they make their own Bloody Mary mix... Great Sunday lunch. Or great anytime. It gets a bit packed but worth the wait."}
{"input": "Very impressed with this place, particularly the menu (amazing) and the food. We ordered the fruit bruschetta (yum, what an awesome idea!) and the Popeye skillet and the Roadhouse sw. Great food, creative options! Couple areas of critique: it was FREEZING (every woman had a sweater on in July) and lack of ambiance. The latter could be easily remedied with some decent background music, and better lighting? (Overhead office lighting is a drag, but large windows a plus) Customer service was good not great, tad disconnected...but it was a holiday weekend. Overall, a keeper. I'll def be back!"}
{"input": "The tickets are $15. There is usually a line to get in and only the first 20-30 people will be seated, the rest of the crowd will be standing. No recording or photos allowed. There are only fans and no AC so does get a bit stuffy.\nThe shows start at 8-9-10. Be sure to have some change ready for Mr Phil's aka the tip hat.\nThe set is 45 minutes long, great traditional jazz. Musicians just follow the music in their hearts eyes closes and immersed. When you get in realx and let the rhythm and the blues will take you away!"}
{"input": "Horrible place!!! I went with a friend to keep her company decided to get my gel polish removed from my acrylics. The lady was horrible she rushed to take them off and when she was \"finished\" I still had polish on every nail and she ruined the shape of my nails. Never going again!"}
{"input": "I basically created my account to talk about how much I loved this place. Everything we ordered tasted extraordinary and the staff was hella nice.  I had to change my reservation [NB: you should probably make a reservation if you want to come here because seating is limited] three times and they were super accommodating and friendly about everything (I don't even know if I would have been that friendly with me at that point).  The food was made to perfection.  I started out with the Burratta Cheese and Fried Green Tomato salad (YUM), which was a nice prelude to the Arctic Char and Lobster Fingerlings (which tasted like little bites of heaven.  I'm not even a big fish fan, but it is supposed to be good for you, blah, blah).  Did I mention it's BYO? Nuff said."}
{"input": "Good Chinese food and really nice beer selection.  Haven't tried the sushi yet, so I can't speak to that.  True, the staff isn't exactly the most cordial, but they're plenty nice enough for Chinese food take out.  This is not an expensive or fancy restaurant, so you should go in with reasonable expectations."}
{"input": "Four stars for price. \nI drive truck, so I've eaten bbq all over America. This place is better than most, but it's certainly not 4 star worthy. I'd say the food is more like 2.5 star. \nThe cheeseburger was quite large and the meat was tasty. (Be advised: if you don't stop them they'll automatically put that disgusting invention called mayonnaise on it.) I got it plain so I can't comment on their lettuce/tomato game. \nThe pork bbq sammich was soggy on the bottom. Moist is good, but this was just plain wet. The meat itself was bland but not bad. \nThe bbq sauce is pretty good but not great. \nThe Mac & Cheese tasted ok but the noodles were way overcooked. It'd be much better if it were baked and had a little crustiness to it. \n\nIf I lived local I'm sure I'd come here occasionally."}
{"input": "Be sure to ask for a written receipt and check it closely.  I didn't get gone one and am pretty sure I was overcharged during Happy Hour."}
{"input": "Great place to go for an inexpensive byte. They have a few locations throughout New Orleans, polite staff great quick service. They do have beer. Love their burgers and fries. Excellent seafood. Plenty of parking."}
{"input": "Great place...great atmosphere...great food BUT not good for groups...waiter would not split the bill for a group of 10....very inconvenient..."}
{"input": "I thought it was a good stay and spa visit after purchasing a \"customer appreciation\" deal with two nights and other credits and discounts. I get the bill and find they still charge for the room and tried to charge me twice for a beverage in the room. The beverage charge was handled but the voucher was a scam and didn't include the room cost at all. I will spread the word and never come back. So much for a good first stay experience. The lady on the phone even gave me attitude. Note: I read the fine print three times or more to avoid this."}
{"input": "I've been to Desi Chaat a lot and wanted to try another place, so I went down the street to Mood Cafe.  There is one guy behind the counter who spent a while asking me what sorts of food I liked and what spice I can handle.  I asked him to explain all of the ingredients and he went through them one by one.  It was very informative and interesting, and I appreciated his excitement and knowledge about the different flavors and combinations.\n\nWe eventually decided on the crazy chaat, a blend of a lot of chaats.  I say \"we\" decided because he took my feedback - and perhaps my mood - into account.  I would venture to say the chaat was life-changing, but I'm also a huge fan of Indian food and chaat so count that as my bias.  In any event, because of the good vibes of this place and the ridiculously delicious food, I will surely be back."}
{"input": "I have used the Monster Minders daily dog walking service for almost 6 months now and have been 100% satisfied!  Carrie and Lindsay instantly connected with my dog Brooklyn during the meet-and-greet.  They keep a detailed file w/ his information on hand & have a handy online booking/payment site. \n\nBrooklyn LOVES Lindsay his first minder and is equally infatuated with his current minder Stephanie.  I was recently home sick when Stephanie came to take Brooklyn for his walk.  To no surprise, Brooklyn was delighted to see Stephanie come into the apartment!  His tail wagged the entire time she was suiting him up to go out.  After the walk he was relaxed, calm and ready for a nap.\n\nThere are many dogs in my building, with many walking services, but the concierges in my building constantly comment on how caring and sweet Stephanie and Lindsay have been with Brooklyn.  \n\nThe Monster MInders are a dog-loving, trustworthy, professional and highly recommended group of people."}
{"input": "Love this place. I tried Clayton nail salon after moving to St. Louis but this place is so much better. People here care about you and listen to what you want. Will definitely go back."}
{"input": "Avoid this place at all costs!! Worst Chinese food. Quality very poor. Table and menus were sticky, silverware filthy. Ordered Jazmine beef.... beef drowned in tons of sauce and grisly. They make you pay for steamed rice? What a rip off! Waiter Nathan provided the worst service I've had in years! Paid $17 for food I couldn't even eat because it was so disgusting. Waiter doesn't  check on you or ask how your meal was... nothing!! The fact that I left my entire plate should have given him a clue, but was oblivious."}
{"input": "This place is UNTOUCHABLE if you want a great environment to enjoy the best sushi in PA. They are clean, very quick with service and just impeccable. I have been all over the area and this is the one I continue to come back to. The outdoor seating is wonderful and there is an area that is under a roof so you can enjoy the outdoors even if the weather is a bit dreary. And the one thing that amazes me is no matter how full the parking lot seems they WITHOUT FAIL are extremely speedy no matter how many customers they have. I wish I could give more than 5 stars.  TOP NOTCH!"}
{"input": "Great food !! Don't shy way . You'll not be disappointed . Flavor of food is on point."}
{"input": "I was going to order delivery but the guy on the phone convinced me there was a very long wait time of 45 minutes to an hour then asked if I was sure I wanted to order. So I'll take my business elsewhere. But I hear the food is really good."}
{"input": "Hear a lot of talk about the Sixers...Eagles and Flyers...it's early but look at the Phillies...plus the ball park is the best in baseball."}
{"input": "We come to this Joann's when we can't get what we need at Michael's or AC Moore - and, as you'd expect, this store is more fabric-focused so we were able to get the adhesive and embellishments my 13 year old needed for a project.\n\nNo issues."}
{"input": "my favorite pizza place in the area . friendly staff and the biggest slices of pizza anywhere . For 4.50 you can get any one of up to 10 different gourmet slices . the margherita and the buffalo chicken are not to be missed . great outdoor dining area I frequently ride my bicycle there have a slice and Ride it off home. nice small dining room in the back ."}
{"input": "Reservations recommended. Great atmosphere and wonderful service. I love their unique spin on island seafood"}
{"input": "Two co-workers and I came here after flying in from Chicago for an afternoon snack. It was almost 3, so we asked if we could wait until happy hour to order. The place was completely empty while we were there, but the space was well decorated and very open. \n\nWe all ordered cocktails (I got the Mint Julep, which was not great, but then a gin drink that was fantastic), and they were all pretty and tasty. We also ordered Mac and cheese, fries, Brussels sprouts, and a pretzel. I didn't try the sprouts (I really don't like them), but everything else was so good! And the prices during happy hour were a great deal. \n\nI'll definitely be back next time we go to Reno!"}
{"input": "We were actually hoping to eat at Jacques Imo's down the street but didn't realize it wasn't open for lunch. We happened upon Squeal, and it was such a fun find.\nThe black eyed pea egg rolls were very tasty and the pulled pork tacos were VERY tasty! My husband loved the collard greens. I highly recommend Squeal!"}
{"input": "We consider Marathon to be Philly's diner. Yummy comfort food at a good price. Tonight, sweetheart loved the matzo ball soup, which is 5-star. I really enjoyed the turkey plate with mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce.  Sweetheart's salmon salad had a lot of yummy ingredients, but the salmon was a bit dry. Marathon is a perfect go-to spot for basic foods that I could make at home, if I cared to cook!"}
{"input": "I had a scheduled appointment no one came to greet me as I pulled up which was fine as I was. 15 minutes early.  I waited a total of 50 minutes still not one service representative met with me.  I had made this appointment a week and half prior.  A service tech came by and asked that I move my car to make room for others this is waiting 1 hour 37 minutes to get waited on .  I said sure and just left as he had no idea when someone would meet with me.  The last thing I get is a voicemail saying I missed my appointment if I wanted to reschedule.  No wonder this dealership has so low ratings.  I will call Honda customer service and voice my concerns next week."}
{"input": "Four of us had dinner at the Sockeye Grill this weekend.  Service was terrible.  Super slow.  Salads were warm and tasteless.  Dressing was watered down. \n\nSalmon was excellent.  Nachos were okay. Finger steaks were mushy and drab. \n\nWaitress  knew her beer. The dark lager was excellent.  The lighter beers we had were too warm. \n\nLooks like this restaurant need some fine tuning.  The atmosphere was like a warehouse, more like being in a barn than a restaurant. \n\nTvs everywhere but the news was on. Huh? How depressing is that? \n\nWe won't be back."}
{"input": "I just had the beignets with a chocolate milk. They were fresh and piled high with confectioners sugar, as the picture shows. They were crispy enough to satisfy that desire, but soft enough not to be overdone like funnel cakes. The taste was great: simple with enough fat to balance out the sugar so it wasn't too sweet. Definitely worth the less than $2 charge. \n\nThe ambiance was fine, having seating both inside (with A/C) and outside. It was cafeteria style. And, for those who don't feel like even stepping out of their cars, there is a drive through. Otherwise, parking is relatively easy (they have their own lot), unlike at the original cafe in downtown New Orleans. Then again, here in this place outside downtown, you're surrounded by memories of anywhere else: Taco Bell, gas stations, etc."}
{"input": "The ice is just like Hansen's. Nice and soft and pillowy. They didn't have sugar free wedding cake but I went with the half wedding cake and half orchid vanilla which was pretty good. Added condensed milk. Very happy with it and it was only 2.75 and huge.\n\nRecommend this place. I live uptown but may make the trek over here when I don't feel like waiting in a huge line at Hansen's, snow is just as good and half the price.\n\nCash only"}
{"input": "The espresso here is excellent. My favorite place to come for an Americano. The staff is polite and friendly and vibes are mellow. It is important to know that there is no access to power outlets, but unlimited wifi access. The bathrooms and the rest of the establishment are always clean."}
{"input": "I travel all over the Midwest for work, and even though I live in Chicago, this is BY FAR the best spot in the MW for a mani/pedi. Clean, professional and attention to detail. Need I say more?"}
{"input": "Came here on a Saturday afternoon with a group of friends,  we all enjoyed the bacon Bloody Mary's! The food was amazing,  so fresh and unique! Our server was great! Enjoyed!"}
{"input": "The people there were super nice. Pizza came out really fast. They have like 40 different toppings to chose from. Pizza was above average."}
{"input": "In Tucson for work and it was lunch time.  This is a Small place on the side of the road in a dirt kind of lot. Looks a bit shady from the outside and definitely wouldn't have stopped if we weren't told the place was good.  I ordered 12 wings and split the flavors between the garlic Parmesan and the medium buffalo, The wings came out and i realized that it was WAY more food then expected since the wings were gigantic.  they were cooked perfect and the flavoring on both were amazing.  My friend ordered the chicken tenders and a basket of bacon cheese fries.  the fries were awesome and enough to be a meal by itself, the 12 tenders was enough food for 2 people!  overall, the food was amazing, prices were very reasonable for the quality and the amount of food, and the girls working we all friendly and nice to look at.  can't wait till i'm back for work and can stop in again!"}
{"input": "Good food but very slow to be seated and get your food. There is no sense of urgency. Staff is nice and they give you large helpings of food. Decorated very cool!  Just not very organized. If they could get there process better it would be 4 star because the food is 4 star."}
{"input": "This was my first time at Our Daily Bread and I loved it! I ordered the lemon-blueberry hotcakes and was very pleased. I loved the hint of the lemon because it wasn't too overwhelming and the maple syrup was really good too! I also ordered the hot chocolate and it was delicious. I am very picky about my hot chocolate and it was just right! My only confusion was where to put my dishes once I was done but I asked an employee and he was very kind and told me to leave them on the table. Go try it everyone!"}
{"input": "Spanish food and The Hill don't go together...right?  WRONG.  Whenever anyone asks me what is my favorite restaurant on the Hill, I always say:  Modesto.  For one reason and one reason alone:  olive tapenade.  Yes, I am secure enough in my own sexuality to say \"Olive Tapenade.\"  That stuff just keeps me coming back every time.  \nI really can't top Aimee K's review - I have tried and liked all of the food dishes she mentioned.  The baked goat cheese is one of my favorite dishes ever.  Anywhere.  So good.  I know they also have half price wine night on Wednesday's (I think)... another reason to go visit this gem of a secret on the Hill.  They always have very unique specialty cocktails and sangrias.  \nThis is a great date spot or a spot to go eat with friends."}
{"input": "Love this place, love the ice cream, love the cool feel of it, love the chalkboard menu. Just great!"}
{"input": "This place has decent Chinese food at reasonable to cheap prices.  The location has been multiple places and was most recently a vegetarian Indian establishment.  You can easily drive past this restaurant and not even notice it.  There has only been one person working the front of house during all my visits and it hasn't ever been crowded during lunch so this has been a quick lunch spot.  It's a pretty bare bones and basic place without a lot of atmosphere but that seems to be reflected in their affordable prices."}
{"input": "Amazing place for deli sandwiches! Really cheap and good. You can say it's a little hole in the wall. The staff is friendly and over all everything is really good. Thanks guys! Keep up the great work."}
{"input": "Talk about amazing breakfast this is your spot I love the meat lover omelette with the biscuit gosh the best!!! And the customer service forget it amazing everybody is so kind and sweet!!!"}
{"input": "We were greeted when we stepped through the door.  We ordered our food.  As we were watching the employees, I was blown away by how slow they moved.  I was really surprised because they were busy!  Not one of them had any hustle to them.  Some guy was sweeping the kitchen floor as the other staff were doing food prep?  The burgers were ok.  I've had better at Smashburger.  The price at Blake's was about right for the quality of the food.  The parking lot is so small, I'm surprised there wasn't an accident!"}
{"input": "This place is great.  You can eat or just shop.  Everyone is helpful and friendly.  Lovely local shop."}
{"input": "I was really quite surprised to learn about New Day Meadery, and I can honestly say that I would not have found out about them if it wasnt for Yelp. When you walk in the first thing I noticed was the great atmosphere and setting of the Tasting Room. Very tastefully done. Speaking of tasteful, the sampling was excellent. I'll have to admit I didnt care for some of the beverages I tasted but I didnt not like them either. My fiance and I were actually fortunate to partake of their 5 year celebration the day we came to visit them. We sampled, purchased two glasses of wine and enjoyed their generous complimentary fruit, meat, and cheese hors doeuvres. We also had the chance to talk with the owners to get to know a little more about them, which they are amazing people. Great people make great wine!"}
{"input": "Excellent, fresh homemade pasta! The atmosphere is warm and they have an extensive Italian wine list. I highly recommend trying this place out! We got the Casarecce alla Genovese (very decadent dish) and the Tonnarelli alla Puttanesca (hint of spicy and saltiness from the olives) both excellent."}
{"input": "Busy place, but we were offered extra- special coffee while we waited. No sooner than it was ready, so was our table. The server was welcoming and offered suggestions for us after we made her aware of some dietary restrictions. My daughter and I shared a salad, entree, and Special grits. Every bite was delicious, beautifully presented, and reasonably priced as downtown prices go. We like this restaurant a lot."}
{"input": "Maybe it's cool but the asshole out behind the X-ray machine, total misogynist, made a huge deal about the pocket knife in my purse and kicked us out even though I offered nicely to have him keep it up front with him. Thanks for proving yet again that America is made of disagreeable, awfully small people. This economy is as much of a wreck as this museum."}
{"input": "Great service and great food. I had the veal and it was awesome. The spinach and mashed potatoes that it comes with we're A+. I would definitely go back and recommend this place."}
{"input": "Great day at the park watching my dodgers play. CBP is always very hospitable even to fans of the opposing team like me. Food and drink is very good at a decent price for ballparks. \nAnd most importantly the team puts on a good show and the sidelines are terrific"}
{"input": "I tried to go here last week and the company is gone. Neighboring business told me he closed up."}
{"input": "I usually really like 8th & Union - good food, decent prices, & cute atmosphere. Unfortunately, today we had a party for brunch and I was honestly embarrassed I recommended it. The weightier had to take our order several times because he forgot what we said. Then when our food came, several things were missing (i.e. It said it came with bacon but no one got bacon, any add ons people made were missing etc.). I believe every one of us had some kind of problem with the order (party of 10). I'm hoping it was just a bad day or a new person, because I was really disappointed. I will definitely give them a second chance & hopefully have a better experience, otherwise I don't see myself returning. That said - I've had dinner there before & been happy! Great happy hour deals. So again, hoping it's just a fluke."}
{"input": "Nice store will plenty of staff to help. Good location and easy parking."}
{"input": "Amy was awesome and put together a great bouquet for my friend (having a bad day) for the very next morning! She was so quick and I asked for purple theme and she delivered with the most creative arrangement. And the way she does the leaves in the vase is so cool. Definitely recommend this place for flowers for any occasion :)"}
{"input": "Worst place I've ever visited. The bouncer was rude and he didn't have to be. This place thinks just cause your on broadway you can treat people bad and over charge. \n I'm not a tourist I live here and will never visit or recommend"}
{"input": "Not only is this place delicious (brussel sprouts, fried chicken and brisket burger were ON POINT), but the owner?/host? guy is super accomodating--lit up a fire for us out back even though no one had been out there and the weather would've advised against it.\n\nDefinitely recommended.\n\nOh, and those pickles. Get as many of them as you can."}
{"input": "Picked-up my rug bedizened with dog vomit. \nBrought my rug back a week later looking like new."}
{"input": "Great experience.\nI reserved online one hour prior to checking the bike out. The bike was in good shape and exceeded my expectation. Will return in the future."}
{"input": "I stayed at the Ritz because I was attending a wedding there.  I wanted a nice up do for the event, so I booked my appt here for 12 on Saturday afternoon.  I arrived 10 minutes early and was seen right away.\nRussell was my stylist and he did an amazing job.  He gave me a gorgeous up do that I was very pleased with.  My hair stayed in place and looked good all night.The only reason I'm not giving a 5th star is because it was very expensive. $95 for an appointment that only took 20 minutes.  I know this is the Ritz and I expected to pay top dollar, but still pricey."}
{"input": "One of my faaaaaav places in Chinatown.  Mango chicken is good, chicken satay, the pancake stuff, and my absolute favorite dish is the beef and flat noodles dish - forgot the name... and of course, the thai iced tea.\n\nAlthough it gets packed on the weekends, the servers get you in and out pretty quickly.  You feel a bit rushed...but I don't mind so much since they sat me quickly and brought out the food in record-breaking time."}
{"input": "I had the worst duck that I have ever had.  It was so tough that I could hardly cut into it.  The cherry sauce was uninspiring at best.  My wife had a curried sole, in which the turmeric was overwhelming.  The only creditable thing was that they agreed to take the duck off my bill."}
{"input": "I have been a client of Stephanie's for many years getting eyelash extensions and have always been happy with her services. She is very professional and I highly recommend. Thank you Stephanie!"}
{"input": "Never thought I'd decide to review a Mc Donald's, but they are always so nice here! Always friendly and they move quickly even when the line is long. I don't go to Mc Donald's that frequently, but I choose this one whenever I want something quick (I work close by) or for like a \"cheat meal.\" (Side note: Is it a cheat meal if you do it often?)"}
{"input": "Normally not into daiquiris but on a particularly hot August day I got a craving and Jazz Daiquiris was right there. Place ain't much to look at but service was friendly - I got a custom blend designed not to be nauseatingly sweet.  Took it home and damned if it wasn't best daiquiri I've had in years.  Big step up from the ubiquitous New Orleans Original even if the Claiborne location leaves a little to be desired."}
{"input": "Great neighborhood spot, good bartenders, good tibs.  They had a great blues guitarist in one Saturday, I think he plays Sunday nights normally but it was just a great time.  My bf is a regular and they keep him in tibs and lager and he's a happy guy.  If you're in the neighborhood stop in!"}
{"input": "I loved my dinner at Aldine last weekend. I give the food, the service, and the ambiance all five stars. The highlights were the pastina with wild mushrooms (on the menu), pasta with boar, and mushroom, barley, egg dish (both were specials--they had fancier names than what I listed but I can't recall). Really interesting flavors, all of them. Also, tried two very interesting brews from Tired Hands Brewery. The servers were friendly and professional. And, the very special treat was that we could hear each other speak (which seems to have become rare or maybe my hearing is just getting worse). I am already planning my return trip. This place is going in my top five with Zahav, Fitler, Barbuzzo, and ... ok my top four."}
{"input": "This place is fast and very reasonably priced. Their take-out portions are small, but only four or five bucks depending on what you get, so you can try a bunch of things without spending too much money. You can also order rice and nan in individual protions so you get just the right amont. \n\nOrdering online is easy too."}
{"input": "Great local joint!!  I've been going here for almost 12 years and it has been consistently decent. I don't care for their chicken Marsala sauce (seemed fake to me!!). Otherwise, the food is great!  We love: Chicken caprese salad, chicken alfredo, black and blue burger, chili cheese fries, Greek salad, chili, Santa Fe chicken sandwich, and many more!! \n\nWe went here for Mother's Day bc the thought of waiting 2 hours at any other chain restaurant sounded horrid to me! The food was really good!!! I called it a \"Cheesecake Factory\" knockoff in the nicest way possible!!! Amazing, quality food with a Cheesecake Factory menu (but smaller) and no wait with great wine, martinis, and beer, and service!! The bartenders are awesome, too!! I swear, the same people have worked there for the past 12 years and they're all kind! Love Moxie's!"}
{"input": "I rent from National in St. Louis at least 4 times a year.  I love renting from the aisle because you can select a car and go.  It makes things so easy.  The staff is always very helpful and friendly."}
{"input": "What a great place.  The history and the secluded location alone make it great but the food is actually terrific.  Great fish and steak.  You have to try this place.  It's like traveling back in time, just wonderful, especially for kids to enjoy the grounds and the hisotry of it.  It would be best to come here during daylight hours so you can tour the site and see everything they have.  After dark, it's very hard to see anything since they do not  have a lot of light here."}
{"input": "These hand grenades don't play!! Thy definitely do the job for $12! \n\nI would rather much have these than hurricanes. They taste more citrusy and pack a more sour punch. Because they're delicious and refreshing tasting, it'll keep you addicted. By the end of the bottle you'll be swirled up!!"}
{"input": "Group of us went to watch the game.  First time I've been in this stadium.\n\nWe ended up getting tickets 2 rows from the very top (ya that sucks).  However, we ended up standing the entire game.  The ball field has a standing area all the way around it.  We stood at the home plate with a perfect view.\n\nHotdogs - $1 on Monday :-)"}
{"input": "always have a good time whenever i go. i love the super spicy sauce at checked pig. if you plan on going go prepared. wear clothes you dont mind getting dirty, bring water, wetnaps, and bring your own beer too because it beats having to go buy it while you're waiting in line. it also helps if you take notes on the ribs and sauces that you've tried because of the amount of different stands."}
{"input": "If you want a hamburger or steak this isn't your joint.\n\nSo going to Pita Jungle was not my choice but my soon to be in-law's choice.  The patio is great to sit outside when it gets cooler out, it's laid back atmosphere is very much vegan- tree hugger.  I guess If you like veggies and healthy stuff this is your place to go. Personally me I'm a meat and potato type of gal who isn't your typical \"I'll order a salad and water\" \n\nThe prices are very reasonable and from what others ordered it appeared the deep friend cauliflower was amazing."}
{"input": "The Han Dynasty was a great venue for our wedding rehearsal dinner! Their dishes are very authentic Chinese cooking and everything we had tasted great. The menu selection and service were excellent, and Megan helped us create a custom menu to mix authentic Chinese and kosher styles, while also incorporating plenty of items for vegetarian and other dietary restrictions. The restaurant comfortably seated 80+ people in their side area with constant, friendly service the whole night. In spite of some misunderstandings on menu totals and pricing, Megan was very patient and accommodating and helped us sort everything out. At the end of the night, our family and friends loved the food and everyone had a great time.\n\nI highly recommend the Han Dynasty to anyone for great food, service, and events coordinating!"}
{"input": "I can't say enough great things about the baked goodies that come out of this kitchen.  I have YET to have anything that is 'subpar'.  Everything comes out with full flavor and with the right texture! Then the delicate and decorative detailing--just phenomenal.  You can tell that TIME and LOVE goes into each piece of goodness!!  I love all of the signature flavors.  I am a 'classic' cupcake person- and absolutely love her signature cream cheese frosting.  Talk about melt in your mouth! If you are looking for any sort of cake, cupcake, pie, cookie, or ALL THE ABOVE...do yourself a favor and treat yourself and loved ones to Sugar Coated! (no pun intended!) =)"}
{"input": "Yeah, I know what you're thinking. One Wawa store is pretty much the same as another, so why even bother writing a review? But I think we have a winner here.\n\nWhen this Wawa store opened for business, gas prices at gas stations all along Concord Pike fell by 30 cents per gallon just to compete with them. Sure, this Wawa store could've followed the general pricing in the area and lowered prices just a few cents, keeping the bulk of the profit. But no, they'll have none of that. I love a store that is on the side of my wallet!\n\nSecondly, I love the automatic start/stop digital air pump. So far, I've only seen that at BJ's Wholesale and Sheetz. It's a snap to use and I get the exact tire pressure every time.\n\nAs for service, they seem nice and relatively efficient. The internal layout of the store is the new style that I first saw in Newark. Having separate non-cigarette cashier lines may speed things up in peak periods, although I've never been there during the day, so I wouldn't know."}
{"input": "Our second favorite place to watch a sunset. It's way north of Tampa, so a bit of a drive. We love to join everyone to clap when the sun goes down...a wonderful way to end the day. \n\nThe music is lively, as are the patrons. Don't expect to swim in the water, it's a rocky beach, not much sand. Have been taking our boys since they were babies...are fifteen now. The food and drinks don't make an impression either way, it's the view and atmosphere that draws you in. \n\nNever disappoints."}
{"input": "A hidden Jem right off Main Street!  It's a no frills place but the food is fresh, healthy and reasonably priced. The smoothie my boyfriend got was so good he took another one for the road. I had the falafel platter and  it was awesome. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"input": "By far the best we experienced in Santa Barbara and it was the only free historic visit. Highly recommend. The view from the tower is beautiful."}
{"input": "I love to explore all the treasures in here! The owners and people who work there are so nice. If you happen to catch the auction, well, extra bonus! There's something for everyone"}
{"input": "I've been to Lush in Arizona, S.F., San Jose and Maui. The one in New Orleans is My favorite one. I love how you can smell a Lush store from a block away. :) I've been to this one a few times, Always on Halloween. Always a fun time :)"}
{"input": "I read at least 30 reviews before I decided to eat here. The only thing that was good was the oysters because it's raw. Everything else was dry and tasteless. The space is cramp. We had people on our backs coughing on us while sitting at the bar trying to enjoy it. Let's just say the 2 half and half baskets that my boyfriend and I ordered was not worth $60."}
{"input": "I've passed by this place for a while and today I decided to stop in ! I'm so mad I waited so long! The cafe is fabulous! The breakfast and Cuban toast are like your momma would make and the atmosphere is great! Super sweet super helpful and the restaurant is so clean. I think I've found my new spot!!"}
{"input": "In from out of state, just killing time. Nice selection of Midwest stuff, staff is helpful. We asked if they ship purchases and they acted like they were offended. Any place this size out West does. Anyhow, didn't see anything that tempted me to schlep it over to UPS. Bought a few little items that fit in our carry ones."}
{"input": "This downtown Philly donut joint was decent -- but far from spectacular.\n\nTried a few different donuts and they were merely cake donuts with different toppings.  Too much of a cake donut taste (which I don't particularly care for).\n\nI can't possibly rate this spot any higher than 3 stars when the greatest donuts on the planet  (Beiler's Donuts) are merely a few blocks away in the Reading Terminal Market."}
{"input": "These place is so fun!  The food is excellent!  The drinks are good too!  Never had bad service here"}
{"input": "Tony's is the most amazing place you've never heard of! My husband and I eat breakfast there every Sunday and it is the perfect spot to make memories. The donuts are amazing and for $5 we're both sufficiently happy! It's the perfect spot for an early morning stop. You're missing out if you don't give it a try."}
{"input": "Better cookies!!!  Try the Chinese \"Jewish Deli\" cookies.\nVery good cakes - but priced a bit high.  Need 48 hours notice for large cakes.\n\nA good place to know about for sure!"}
{"input": "The setting is very interesting and reminded me of a Mexican restaurant: bar area, music, and ambiance. However, the food really does justice and there were plenty to choose from. I was craving for dinuguan and although it was cooked well, I was expecting the traditional sour taste. The bicol express was both sweet and spicy, which was a good combination. If you are craving for filipino food, this place will suffice."}
{"input": "Chris was our server and he was great. He seemed like the easy going kind of guy you'd want to hang out with. He gave us great recommendations and checked on us frequently. \n\nThe food was great. I had the Piggy Mac. Pulled pork topped with rich gouda mac and cheese sprinkled with panko and baked to a crispy brown. I ended up spooning the mac to the side so I could add Puckett's own sweet, yet spicy BBQ sauce to the tender, juicy pork.\n\nMy son (he's eight but eats like a teen) ordered the meat plus two veggies kids plate. He said the green beans were the best he's had and loved the pulled pork without and sauce. \n\nWe ate early so we missed the music (get there around 8pm) but the place has great lighting and atmosphere no matter the occasion. \n\nAlso, park in the back behind Frothy Monkey. It's free and has more space than on the street."}
{"input": "This is the best Italian food I've ever had. Very small elegant restaurant, entrees were really good and very tasty cheesecake. To top it off, the entire staff was super friendly. Highly recommended for date night."}
{"input": "My go to breakfast joint whenever I'm in Mount Laurel. They have great omelets and ambiance. Wish I knew about them years ago. They always offer me free coffee to go when I leave. Love them!"}
{"input": "Don't get me wrong, the donuts were delicious, but I thought the process was extremely difficult. When you go to a \"make your own\" donut joint you go for the experience, and their clip board was not doing it for me. The amount of items on the clipboard seemed overwhelming and I was instantly confused. I was also extremely disappointed that you could only get one topping. I was really excited to let my almost two year old load up his donut as a special treat, come to find out he could only add sprinkles. The donuts were tasty, but in my opinion it isn't worth a drive. The experience just didn't do it for me."}
{"input": "We love Club 21!  Our family has been coming here since the 1970s, and the food has always been excellent.  Their carne seca is the best in town and is impossible to resist--order anything with it, and you won't be disappointed.  But everything here is good, and we like that you can order a huge plateful of food, or, unlike most restaurants, you can get virtually any item a la carte if you just don't have a huge appetite.  Margaritas are freshly made, tasty, and very reasonably priced.  The staff is always friendly, and most of them have been around forever.  And we like the retro decor, as the dark bar area is where we have always chosen to sit; if you prefer it brighter, you can sit in the newer room with the big window."}
{"input": "Sarah is amazing. I had a great night singing with the red piano and having fantastic drinks. Come here for a break from shopping or just passing by. This bar is great the people are friendly & Amazing.  Definitely coming again! Thank you l!"}
{"input": "For us, a trip to Tarpon Springs would not be complete without stopping at Hellas. We visited twice recently. Both times we enjoyed outstanding Greek salads, tasty treats from the extensive bakery, friendly and attentive service, as well as the pleasant, Greek-influenced atmosphere."}
{"input": "Mark the bartender is awesome!!! Mmmm great mochatinis and great music in a nice lounge= happy me  Stop by when you are at the peppermill!!"}
{"input": "Good food excellent service, everything was delicious. We ordered firecracker shrimp which came to us quickly we sat at the bar because it was a 3 hour wait to the formal side of the restaurant. They told us you can eat the full menu in the bar area which was true. There was a really good band playing live music, the servers were attentive and we would definitely go back. We ordered alcohol, appetizer, entree, salad, and dessert. We had the salmon and swordfish both were great! Also had HUGE fish tank from famous tv show tanked. Nice views."}
{"input": "First experience with Josh M. and A-1 Plumbing/Perfect Air and had a great experience.  Seemed sincerely to care about the client and well being.  Was not oversold on anything but given recommendations of what he would be doing if it was his home.  Felt very comfortable with the Josh and the Company's overall professionalism.  Will use for some needed repairs in future."}
{"input": "Enjoyed very much. One of the best Indian \nRestaurant I ever had. we are from Los Angeles and  Yelp lead us here. Tandoori chicken is a must try."}
{"input": "Really enjoyed the unique style of ice cream here. Great ice cream spot in the USF area. I strongly recommend this place and will definitely be back to try some of the other flavors."}
{"input": "Love it here. Haven't had a bad meal yet. The wraps are awesome. This pasta is awesome. I heard the Gyros are good as well. Love to eat outside Services usually pretty quick, except at lunch time sometimes it can be a little challenging to get your food quickly. We will continue to keep coming back, many gluten-free options. This was one of the first places we ate at when we came to Tucson.  Highly recommend!"}
{"input": "Been here 5 times and its hit and miss. The first time was pretty good, second time was ok but the last 3 times have been crappy. On one occasion they were really busy so I'd give them some leeway but the sushi is very inconsistent from visit to visit. Good value for lunch but not for dinner."}
{"input": "So glad we found this place on Yelp. Had a Huge portion of delicious red beans and rice with pork shank and the boudin balls. Definitely recommend this place if you're in New Orleans. Not far from French Quarter with free parking."}
{"input": "Came here based on the reviews. Sorry to say I was disappointed.\nSpring roll was soggy inside, lacked flavor and the included sauce didn't help.\nLemongrass soup was good - albeit only contains mushroom.\nThai iced tea was too sweet.\nRed curry chicken was sweet rather than hot. Something didn't taste right with that (it's curry).\nPad Thai was soggy and didn't taste like regular Pad Thai.\nLastly the mango with black sticky rice. Sticky rice was too sweet - they had incorporated the condensed milk into it so there's no way to adjust the sweetness. Then the mango itself was sour - not ripe enough."}
{"input": "Lots of good options in this area and the tavern is definitely one of them.  I came here for drinks one night and lunch during the day.   A bit of a wait for dinner so make sure you get a reservation if you can.\n\nWe got an appetizer - buffalo cauliflower.  It's slightly breaded and engulfed in buffalo sauce.  Good taste, but would've preferred to have it a bit crispier.  \n\nOrdered the burger - cooked medium, lettuce, tomato, American (cheese is extra).  The fries were okay - comes in a little fryer basket.  The burger had a good sear on the outside and properly seasoned with salt.  \n\nGood spot for food and drinks."}
{"input": "My favorite local Mexican restaurant. The chimichangas and cheese dip are delicious! Busy on Monday nights as it is there taco night."}
{"input": "Absolutely amazing and unique food. Love their bobba and pork pancake!"}
{"input": "Over priced for one.  And the lady there is full of crap.  I asked where i could get Khaffir Lime leaves, since she didn't have them.  She told me that I wouldn't be able to get Fresh Lime Leaves since they don't allow them in the country! (Say what?!) She directed me to two Asian spice Markets in university city that never even heard of them.  I found fresh lime leaves at a Thai Market in the Reading Terminal Market.  FRESH.   She is just full of crap.  And her prices for her spices are over priced.  It is catty corner from Di Bruno's."}
{"input": "Feel like you're in Puerto Rico restaurant  excellent service good ambient, the mofongo is amazing."}
{"input": "Great place to hear some live jazz old and new. Reasonable drink prices considering the entertainment value and no cover charge."}
{"input": "Couldn't have asked for a better location but horrible maid service and not worth the price. Horrible communication between the staff. The room was nice but didn't include a mini fridge or blow drier. The wi-fi was also a problem. It stopped working and when I asked the front desk about it they told me to call a number.... Which I was on hold for too long with. The pool was heated and had a nice view but one night was hot tub hot and the next was luke warm. Wouldn't recommend this hotel."}
{"input": "As a weekly traveler to Arizona, Pita Jungle is a staple restaurant of mine as the food is great and healthy.  This Tucson location definitely lacks something.  Food is excellent but the people just aren't super nice.  Usually the Pita Jungle staff is bubbly, happy and have an overall excitement.  Not here.  It's kinda depressing.  The brunette bartender who took my order was adequately not rude but certainly wasn't going to any great lengths to secure any kind of tip or repeat guest.  Even after I sat at the bar less than 2 minutes from placing my to go order with her, she hands me a menu and says \"she'll take my order in a second\".....ummm, my dear you literally just took my order 2 minutes ago.  The staff needs some training in smiling and being friendly.  Lots of places to spend my money and this kind of service makes me rethink spending it here."}
{"input": "UPDATE: The manager invited me back to the Mason Jar for a complimentary meal. He explained (correctly) that I had received the wrong order when I came in the first time. For the free meal I chose the chicken Parmesan bites with fries, which is a small plate. The fries were awesome and there were so many chicken bites that I had to take a go box home.\nI am willing to return to the Mason Jar for another try. The manager, Nakia, went out of his way to correct the mistake, and in today's food industry....that's rare."}
{"input": "Stopped here about a year ago when my husband & I were looking for some real food on Bourbon St. He loved his burger, we also got some yummy fries, but I have not stopped thinking about the FRIED PICKLES!!! We tried them at a few other places, don't bother, everyone else was way too salty. But these were amazing! I've even tried to recreate them at home to no avail. I'm pregnant now & have literally had dreams about these things. I wish we didn't live in New Jersey, sigh..... \n\nAlso, it was a year ago & a weeknight during the off-season for New Orleans, but the waitress was very friendly & attentive. She didn't seem to mind we were just hanging out, mostly munching on apps & drinking brews."}
{"input": "We stopped in while bar hopping for a friend's birthday. We never left. \n\nThe karaoke was great, and it didn't take very long for out name to be called. An upscale dive bar. Drinks were reasonably price. (Especially for the Ybor strip). Service was very attentive for how busy it was. \n\nEverything was rather low key. However, we left at 1 am. I can image they have their crazy nights too.\n\nNo real \"special\" drinks, but they can make all the classics and offer beer as well. All in all a quality stop and we will be back again!"}
{"input": "Yo- just order the Grits no matter what time of day you think it is. \n\nHistorically, most of the time I was too hung over to recall how we got there, but thankful that I had arrived. Guaranteed that by the time I left I was a new person.\n\nOn a side note, Honey's always seemed to be part of the worlds longest walk of shame.  The only way to improve the place would be to offer a locker room with showering facilities.\n\nOne time, near Halloween, I want to see Pinback play at the TLA. I had dressed in a full Hooters uniform and received many accolades from my date, other concert attendees and the general public. The next morning we woke up and drove a scooter to Honeys. I sat there, a bit worse for wear, eating the Grits in that uniform and really could have used a shower."}
{"input": "I went here for the first time a few days ago.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere and customer service.  The ladies all had really good attitudes.  I will definitely be going back!"}
{"input": "I ordered the combo vermicelli and was pretty disappointed. The meat portion was very small compared to the huge portion of rice noodle they gave me make it look like there's a lot of food. The combo cake with 2 bland shrimp, 1 eggroll and a few pieces of marinated beef. I also ordered an iced viet coffee which was pretty decent. It wasn't as strong as the ones you would get from 626 or OC area. However, it's pretty good coming from SB. I think they diluted the flavor a bit as well. Overall, I would come back for their viet coffee but not for their main course."}
{"input": "Had the fried wontons with shrimp and ground chicken and a sweet chili sauce that was SO GOOD. I also had the beef pho that was also excellent. I was so pleased. The service was pretty good you seat yourself and they kind of leave you alone which I don't mind. My server kept my drink refilled and had a very pleasant attitude. I'm so glad I found this place and didn't have to spend $30 lol"}
{"input": "I'm not a breakfast person so I wasn't very excited about going here but wow!!! The wait was LONG - but worth it. The best food at our table was crawfish biscuit but everything else was very good. My son loved his fried chicken gravy biscuit and the hash browns were really good. The staff were very helpful when we explained our time crunch and helped by taking our order before we got our table. Excellent."}
{"input": "Awesome blue cheese dirty martini, amazing Louisiana oysters, great buffalo sliders and great hand cooked chips. Enjoyed the visit and the jazz music was very pleasant. Ambience is lovely would totally go back again."}
{"input": "The service SUCKS!!!!  The food is mediocre, at best,  and definitely not worth a second trip. We ordered flat bread to start 30 min before we ordered apps and entrees. The flatbreads arrived at the same time the apps did."}
{"input": "Great staff. Great drinks. The 5 is because they make my current favorite local beer. The undisputed shadow boxer!!! Very nice place inside and I highly recommend a stop here at some point in your night out."}
{"input": "Awesome sauce! Great way to start off your moring\n\nWe got a dozen donuts to bring to the office for Friday fun day. The prices are reasonable, the selection is extensive and the donuts are TASTY! I also like the unique options they offer such as the mini donettes and to-die-for cinnamon rolls. \n\nThe donuts were very fresh and light. I tried the apple streusel which was FANtastic and one with strawberry frosting and sprinkles. I liked that they didn't taste artificial or too sugary or heavy. If I had to pick again, I'd definitely pick this over the franchise chain competitor."}
{"input": "Worst service in IL.  Lost our order, waited 25 minutes for an app.   They decided to start cleaning at 8pm.  Terrible,never going back to a Cheddars."}
{"input": "The menu at Mother Hubbard's is unique among brunch restaurants in Tucson. You can find waffles made with unconventional grains (buckwheat, corn, green corn)! The sausages, bacon, and brisket are made in-house (and are delicious)! There are many different Southwestern interpretations of traditional egg dishes as well. \nThis restaurant tends to be busy, and the space is not large. I recommend showing up early (before 10:00 AM), or be prepared to wait.\nThis is not a \"high end\" dining experience, but the food is interesting and delicious, so Mother Hubbard's is well worth a visit."}
{"input": "I decided to stop by since I was in the area and craving some authentic Mexican cuisine. I was literally by myself (late lunchtime on a tues) and really excited to try the pazole!! It was delicious ( granted my first and only time) I believe it's pork and has hominy, lettuce, radishes,onions and they give you a small container of dried oregano. Not the biggest fan of the lettuce cause it's gets all wilted but add some hot sauce and it's a meal in itself!!! I got also got the taco lunch special (2 pork tacos and rice) and that was good. Besides the amazing service from the sweet lady, the salsa was way sweet! Wasn't the biggest fan but everything is def fresh! And the pineapple water is a must. I don't like pineapples but I read reviews and just had to try it and thank u guys! Great reviews :) I'm excited to come back to try the burritos esp since I come out here for Costco shopping (soooo close by!) pretty dangerous when I find good food cause then I get cravings :/ enjoy this gem and eat up!!!"}
{"input": "My family has been going to Luberto's for over 10years.  The food has pretty much remained the same.  Large portions and good food.\n\nHowever, the service is HORRIBLE!  Our waitress did not bring us drink refills, didn't check on us and our food took forever (we had 2 children) without any explanation.  There are so many other good restaurants in the area.  Why would I give them my money!"}
{"input": "I still love this place just as much as I ever did, and here's why:\n\n1) Super friendly and knowledgeable staff \n2) Roomy, with lots of outlets and enough space to accommodate mid-sized groups (like the recent Yelp Office Hours)\n3) Delicious tea, of course!\n\nI've always loved their \"Awake\" Fizz Tea, but I've also broadened my horizons to include Pearl Tea (aka bubble tea). The taro flavor rocked my socks off. It did take a little getting used to though, as I had a mini anxiety attack every time I took a sip. Because I got it warm, it was in a paper cup and I never knew when a pearl was making its way into my mouth. As a result, I spent half my drink wondering \"is there one in my straw?\" It's totally worth the suspense, though.\n\nThe only thing that still troubles me is the music. It's just...not right. In fact, sometimes it's pretty distracting. It's easily avoided, however; just bring headphones and your own musical selection and all is well."}
{"input": "I was lucky enough to get Erin for my blow dry.  I am new to the area and wasn't sure what I would get, but was so pleasantly surprised by the nice people and also Erin's blow dry.  Not to mention the lady who washed my hair massaged my head amazingly!I bought the pack of four and will definitely be going back.  A great little spot and reading the other reviews I will use Erin for other services like cuts and colors as well.  If you are on the fence, definitely go and get Erin."}
{"input": "Went to see the little trains of jingle rails. It is a good time every year"}
{"input": "I went Saturday night with a small group of friends, and Marrakesh was quite the experience.  I think with a larger group it would just get better!  \n\nAfter finding the restaurant in a back alley and knocking on the door to get in, we were seated promptly in the front room.  Reservations would be a good idea on weekend nights especially.  \n\nThe food was yummy - not earth shattering perhaps, but definitely a good range and interesting for a fixed course meal.  We chose the spicy chicken and the beef kabobs, and they were probably the best two courses (well besides baklava and mint tea being so awesomely delicious).  We also called ahead and found out that although they now have a full bar, you can still bring in a bottle of wine.  Definitely a good deal - heads up that some of the servers seem rather confused about the policy.\n\nAfter almost 3 hrs (!) I was full and well entertained - I highly recommend the experience."}
{"input": "The Peppermill has be getting better and better each time I have seen it. They are working hard on making the hotel competitive with other large hotel's in other major tourist areas. they offer many different restaurant selections and have a massive casino. \n\nFor children they have an amazing arcade."}
{"input": "The atmosphere is awesome. The food is delicious. Just a tad overpriced in my opinion. But...that hasn't stopped me from eating there....several times. :)"}
{"input": "Oh how I want to like Bailey's Range more!!!\n\nThe good:\nThey have a community table dinner once a month where they have guest chefs come in and create a buffet (different each month).  It costs $20 all you care to eat and all proceeds go to a different organization each month.  Beautiful concept and beautifully executed.\n\nThey make their own gluten free bread.\n\nThey have the brilliant combo of bourbon, candied bacon, and salted caramel ice cream.  Mmmmm......good.\n\nThe not so good:\nThe gluten free bread leaves a lot to be desired.  Very dense, heavy and super crumbly.  I admire the desire to make things in house but there are way better gluten free bread makers in St. Louis that could provide them with buns.\n\nThe burger (ABC burger) was dry and way too overcooked for my taste.  \n\nThe price is waaaay too high in my opinion and I left there feeling nickel and dimed for every little thing.\n\n\nOverall:\nI will be back to try again.  Third time's the charm, right?"}
{"input": "Oooo my goodness....this place the best little BBQ joint in Sumner County!!! No complaints only compliments on everything that I have eaten. From the beans, BBQ, catfish to the banana pudding...I just cannot say anything but, YUMMY!!! The staff is incredibly sweet and accommodating. It seems to always be packed, and there's a reason why...but TRUST ME, it's absolutely worth the wait!!!"}
{"input": "My absolute favorite Thai place in Nashville. Excellent service, beautiful food presentation and conveniently located 2 minutes from my house ;) i can order anything here and be perfectly satisfied"}
{"input": "I had falafel sandwiches when they had a special. They were huge, filling and tasted amazing!!!"}
{"input": "I need to go to whatever catered events that Holy Guacamole is attending because the cuisine at Brick and Mortar is outstanding! We dined with a party of 8 and everyone could not stop raving about the food! Service was on point and the cuisine from appetizer to dessert was second to none in the Bay Area! Do not miss this place if you are in St. Pete, but get there early as the wait is understandably long after 7:00."}
{"input": "Originally, our little group headed to Franklin Fountain and the line was around the block-- Capofitto was only a few steps away with no line (and bonus--cheaper/better dessert treat!). We only popped in for gelato, but I would love to come back for the pizza! It looked and smelled really good. Gelato was amazing, as capogiro gelato always is. Highly recommend chocolat scurio and pera as a combo--it was perfect!"}
{"input": "I'm loyal to Hyatt when I can be and this was convenient for a business trip earlier in the week.  I was able to get an early check-in on a Sunday which was great, and the hotel seems quite new and was very clean.  The room layout is different than most other Hyatt Place hotels that I've stayed, but you still get the wrap around couch and flat screen that swivels to face the bed as well.  \nThe place was quiet, but I don't think it was very full either. Breakfast is standard continental fare for the most part. \n\nIt's clean and friendly, and there are enough local food places to deliver relatively quickly."}
{"input": "Great service - the owner has been out twice and got all my sprinklers working and installed a new controller. Definitely knows his trade! Don't hesitate if you have sprinkler problems!"}
{"input": "Great food and atmosphere. Great cocktails. We had the burger, the chicken sandwich and salad. All were great. The fries were cooked perfect. The two manhattans we had were strong pours and well crafted."}
{"input": "Went in for lunch and tried the jerk chicken and curry goat.  My friend LOVED her goat and to surprise, the jerk chicken had been cooked on the pit and was delicious!  Ive been searching for jerk ckicken and every place cooks it in the oven?!! So happy to find a spot where the chicken is done right! Only draw back was that it was a lil dried out. If it wasnt for that, it would have been nearly perfect.  Will def come back!"}
{"input": "No wait but we went at 9:30 on a Thursday night. Pizza was great! Waitress seemed bothered and busy. Speakers were really loud. Only six people in the place no reason to have them that loud. So sum it up good great service not so much."}
{"input": "The store is bright and makes you want to SHOP!\n\nI love this Sephora even though I love MAC makeup. Sephora offers it all. They have so many brands.\n\nNow they are on the expensive side I have found great items in here from makeup, skincare, to perfume.\n\nThe makeup brand I found to love is Makeup Forever, Benefit, and Sephora brand cosmetics.\n\nThe skincare that I loved from Peter Thomas Roth blemish mask it was $40 but I have had it for about 2 years now and it help even my esthetican even sells the product. I must get some more.\n\nThen perfume they have it ALL. You can even go in and get whatever sample you would like. This is my vacation perfume hookup.. SHHH dont tell no body..\n\nBut SEPHORA overall is a great STORE!"}
{"input": "Like walking into a cave with Bacchus himself trying to sell you a bottle or 10. Best selection in town and by far the most enthusiasm for wine, which, in New Orleans, is saying something. Make the trip out."}
{"input": "Visiting the area so found this place via Yelp. Very busy, limited parking but we got lucky somebody was leaving. Also got the last table, however there were spots at the bar. I ordered breakfast quesadilla and home fries. Very good. Coffee good too. My husband got the biscuit and gravy platter and loaded home fries and my son got the Bradley's breakfast sandwich. Both said their food was good. \n\nService was quick and friendly. If we are in the area again we would return."}
{"input": "The best grits in Nola + consistently good breakfast/brunch + pleasant staff and service. This is a go-to when I want a good brunch without a crazy long wait or reservation needed. It's a small location so there is an occasional wait, but the staff is great at turning tables and only accepting food orders as space becomes available for seating. I usually take visitors here when they want something casual but delicious. Definitely a good spot that locals frequent!"}
{"input": "I gave 4 stars because I agree they did a great job of bringing this place back up to date. I have been for lunch 5 different times now. Working my way down the menu is fun. I haven't found anything I don't like yet. The price is reasonable and the staff is friendly. Plus it's in the neighborhood!"}
{"input": "I have eaten here mainly for breakfast, but the juevos rancheros was amazing.  We did stop in and eat chips and salsa and my wife got one tamale for a snack.  Both were great.  The salsa was a little spicy, which I enjoy and the tamale was home made and delicious.  We'll be back."}
{"input": "It's extremely overpriced, and the sandwiches are a joke. I love Mediterranean cuisine but this is one of the worst i had. In a city with so many places to eat, i'd expect they would try harder.\n\nService is excellent, though. And the place is really nice"}
{"input": "Absolutely wonderful food & service! Go there for lunch/dinner with my boyfriend at least once every two weeks. Prices are very much reasonable. Weekends get pretty packed so may have to wait a little bit but that's never an issue for us. Always get the Indian Pancake & the Hainanese Chicken or Curry Chicken. Other dishes are delicious as well. Never get tired of it!"}
{"input": "Hands down the best veggie wings I've had anywhere. Seriously. I can never stop thinking about them. Their fried pickles are also great, though I've found their drinks to be a bit weak. I'll stick to a Mexican coke whenever I'm here."}
{"input": "The food was awesome and the service was warm and genuine. I liked the coziness of the space. Parking was as easy as it gets with a parking lot in the back. I never write reviews, but I felt compelled to write this one because the food really was stellar. Try the Zeppolis, you will crave them every time you settle for a donut."}
{"input": "Good beer and food. Plenty of options right off the beach. Prices are plans have nice outside seating. May need to hire some hotter girls to work here."}
{"input": "I got a gift certificate here and decided to come check it out. I was thrilled with my hair cut and color! Chad was amazing, truly listened to what I wanted, gave me feedback on what he thought about it and helped me to figure out how to best get what I wanted. I will absolutely be going back to him. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that both times I've come for hair appointments I've had to wait 15 minutes - other than that the services have been great!"}
{"input": "We love this little cozy Italian Restaurant. It's on Main Street in Manayunk. We had the Bistecca and the Four Cheese Gnocchi, delicious.. nice wine section too. We will def. always recommend."}
{"input": "My husband, Kevin and I, had a lovely lunch today, July 18th. Dawson's food was Very Good. We ordered 2 orders of deep fried fish and a cheeseburger. Our server was Shannon and she was great--pleasant and skilled; we had a leisurely lunch and we never felt rushed. We ordered 3 meals because the lunch portions were smaller, and when we ordered a hamburger, as our 3rd meal, Shannon was nice enough to ask someone in their kitchen to half it and put it on another plate for us. We didn't ask for this courtesy but it was appreciated. It showed us her attention to detail. And our runner for drinks and plate removal was Karolina. She was very accommodating, and very pleasant, too. Dawson's definitely has some of the nicest employees you will find."}
{"input": "We ate at the bar on a Friday night, where the extremely charming bartender made us the best Manhattans I've ever had, using Carpano Antica Formula vermouth.  We ordered the lamb meatballs, which were okay, and the spring rolls, which were excellent. \n\nThis is a perfect place to stop for a drink in the Quarter, if you need a nice civilized break.  The drinks were extremely expensive, but well worth it for the occasional night out.\n\nThe manager, Eric, could not have been more professional and friendly.  We will definitely go back."}
{"input": "Gaylord Opryland: A Country Christmas Show with Larry Gatlin & The Gatlin Brothers! The good news of the review- the vocals of the Gatlins were delicious! Their harmonies were scrumptious leaving the audience wanting more! They sang, had audience banter, and entertained for about an hour! It was delightful! It was wonderful to hear all the brothers take the lead on various songs! The bad news was the meal prior! The mushroom soup was good, the rest was downhill! The small crab cake -most at the table didn't eat. The chicken breast was okay as were the mashed potatoes! Oddly the rolls they served with the meal were sweet with honey on them. Not a fan! The worst part was the service! They were in such a hurry they were literally taking plates before folks were through! Final thoughts-the show is worth it  to hear the brothers perform, cut the meal and cut the price and the result will be happier customers!"}
{"input": "Very helpful employees and they have a great selection of beer! I always go to Ed's over any other local beer distributor."}
{"input": "Food is delicious, staff is great. Love the lettuce wraps! All the food is worth the price. Good for takeout and dine in. My ultimate favorite restaurant."}
{"input": "The best Cuban ever!  And cofecito a bonus"}
{"input": "Terrible terrible terrible. Out of 6 meals we ordered to go, 5 had to be thrown away. We were missing half the components that were supposed to be part of the meal (no buns for our burgers, no fries that were supposed to come with it) items which were described as vegetarian came with bacon, it was just a major fail all the way around. The few components that we did try were completely flavorless. We will never go back or order from here again. Waste of time and money as I then had to go home make make dinner."}
{"input": "As the other reviewers have noted, the woman who runs this cleaners is very friendly, service is very quick (both waiting on you at the register and in doing the actual cleaning), and over several years so far they haven't lost anything of mine.\n\nHere are some recent prices (as of November, 2011):\nMan's dress shirt, starched, on hangers - $1.65\nMan's suit - $9.30\nHem men's pants - $10"}
{"input": "I ran over a nail near some of the new construction near Allisonville Road and got a tow to this Firestone location. I had gone to another firestone location in the past, and was pleasantly surprised that they were able to pull up all of my history as I wasn't sure when the last time I got tires and also if I had purchased any warranties on it. The woman at the front desk was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. I assumed that they would make me get all 4 tires changed (as that is typically what happens when one tire goes out at least for me) but the woman walked me through why I only need to change two of my four tires. I was very grateful because that would have added another $400 if I got all four tires changed. Bottom line, I felt very confident that the employees here were looking out for my best interests, and not for their wallets!"}
{"input": "Great place for kids.  It was worth the trip to go once, even though we didn't bring any children.  Pretty interesting, especially the dinosaur exhibits."}
{"input": "People in this place are generally friendly, but do not make the mistake of going to Katie.  She went through my hair like a bulldozer-- slapped colour on it in less than 5 minutes and cut it in even less time.  I think she was in a rush to get out of there (it was late in the day), but then she shouldn't have agreed to take me on.  The whole thing cost me close to $200, and I was shaken up by the experience."}
{"input": "Completely unprofessional and pathetic. I called last week to get price quotes on a battery and brakes. I spoke to someone very nice- he gave me two quotes, fairly low but close to other shops. I call today to schedule a time to come in and the prick who answers the phone, his name is either Mike or Nick (and quite frankly I don't care what he's called), tells me there is no battery even close to that price. He \"blames\" the quote on me, saying \"I don't know how you came up with that price?\" Then I told him I'd like to speak to someone else and he says \"no, we won't do a battery for that price, so bye-bye\" and he HUNG up the phone. NEVER NEVER call these people. I can go to Walmart before I deal with these assholes."}
{"input": "I absolutely loved this place when i first started and still do but won't be going back.  They did not honor something they told me they would. I won't go into much detail as they know the problem. I don't know what happened in the last few months but it is completely gone down fast. They are unorganized and all over the place. They got rid of their best trainers. They don't seem to be very loyal to their older clients that have been there since day 1."}
{"input": "Still without a sign, this Han location might be a bit difficult to find.  We managed to spot it and doubled back.  Unfortunately, the kitchen had just closed.  Luckily, they were willing to prepare us something to go.  We kept it simple on them and ordered the dan dan noodles.  \n\nDon't take the 3-star review the wrong way, the food was great.  However, it seemed no where near as good as the Manayunk location, which I also tried shortly after it first opened.  Considering it was to-go and knowing Han doesn't put out 3-star food, I'll be back (when the kitchen is open) to give them another shot at boosting the score."}
{"input": "First we shared a Blossom Onion (delicious ). Then we had rib eye steaks and they were cooked to perfection and had a great taste. \nWe went on a Sunday about 2:00pm and were seated right away and service was OK. The waitress took our order in a timely manner but never came back to check on us to see if we needed anything until we asked for the bill.\nThey have a Early Bird menu for $8.99 until 3:00pm but we wanted the Ribeye's ( not on the Early Bird Menu ) \nWill go back again."}
{"input": "Went here the other day with some friends for a bite and a drink. Service was great as where the drinks ;) Will definitely be back!"}
{"input": "Three Muses you are a gem and my favorite dinner spot in New Orleans. The wait was worth it, there's a reason why there's a wait, trust me. \n\nThe service was excellent. The atmosphere is cozy and elegant. The live music was a great addition and really makes this place feel like home. The cheese plate and salads are great. Also don't skip out on dessert, I'd recommend the pana cotta! :) don't miss out on this wonderful restaurant in the heart of jazz alley."}
{"input": "very good seafood,very fresh,ate here three times on two different visits to S.B. There is a wait for tables ,but who cares. the view is great ."}
{"input": "Excellent variety on the menu. A couple items for vegetarians. Amazing oyster omelet, pancakes, cinnamon bun, and French toast on the brunch menu.  Friendly staff and interesting cocktails. Definitely worth another visit."}
{"input": "I love this place. The owner is awesome and very hands on. Everyone that works here is friendly and will talk to you. I eat here a couple times a week. \n\nI like that they know me by name."}
{"input": "I have to give this little hole in the wall in the perfect location a woohoo!   There is a limited amount of seating and the restaurant is the very end of the Santa Barbara pier; it is in walking distance of many of the hotels close to the water in SB.  \n\nThe Shellfish Company is a good name for this restaurant as there is all kind of yummy seafood.  I opted for the Maine Lobster tacos that had fresh avocado, a spicy mayo dip on the side, lettuce, tomatoes, served on 2-double tortillas with rice.  The wine menu is generic, but I had a nice glass of Santa Barbara Wine Company Chardonnay along with a 2nd glass of generic White Zin.  They do not have espresso or dessert, but that was no big deal as the experience was perfect.  Good window views and seats at the bar... it is small and I would anticipate on the weekends the place is near impossible to get into.  Check it out next time your in Santa Barbara it is quite the experience."}
{"input": "Wow! What a great dining adventure! Huge rolls, good sake, good beer and HOT tea- was all awesome!"}
{"input": "Love this place! Furniture is very high quality and American made. There are so many cool timeless items here. You are paying for the quality, these are investment pieces. You are not buying a $6k sofa to change it out in 3 years. If you are looking decor for to set your home apart, go to Arhaus."}
{"input": "Had a great breakfast here last weekend before we headed out. You order at the front and they will bring the food out. I had the French toast (fruit on the side)  with an a la carte fried egg on the side. They dropped my egg when they got to the table but promptly brought out another one. I also had a vanilla latte which was yummy....no extra sweeteners needed. \n\nWe sat outside on the patio which was just lovely. Even if you sat inside, like other restaurants in the French quarter, every door and windows are open, so fresh breezes flow throughout. Really nice experience."}
{"input": "Horrible,  they have a scary mascot that scared my grandson and I asked him twice and my waitress for him not to come to our table.  Did he listen NO,kept coming back! Also served  a drink with a big crack! We will never return"}
{"input": "We had a great ribeye here that was cooked to perfection.  Great flavor and char.  Salads and side was equally good.  Our server was very attentive also.  We'd definetely go back!"}
{"input": "Another Nashville-area secret--just south of the city in Grassland. Oh my! Have had lunch here several times. Always great food served with courtesy. Stopped this morning for the Sunday Brunch. Oh my! Sweet, savory, succulent, satisfying and a bargain to boot! Too many dishes to mention, so let me highlight just a few: Eggs Benedict served on split Croissant instead of English Muffin - so flavorful, rich & creamy, eggs done perfectly. Jalapeño Grits - not hot - just piquant enough and so very, very sweet and buttery...mmm. Broccoli salad (and other salads) plus grilled veggies - just right. Steamed shrimp cooked just right. Coconut-crusted Goat cheese medallions - decadently melt in your mouth. Roast beef with wild-mushroom gravy...the beef was tender and bright, pink rare--beautiful. (The mushroom gravy just so-so.) Baked ham. Desserts that I didn't have room to try. And, did I mention...made-to-order omelets and waffles. The list goes on. Oh my. Oh my!"}
{"input": "Definitely get in line before 8:30am. We waited about 30 minutes. Pancakes were fine. My friends got the raspberry pancakes, the sweet potato pancakes and the san antonio. I got the sugar and spice pancakes. All were well and fine, a bit dry. I don't understand the hype, but if the line isn't too long it's not bad for normal breakfast food. If the line is longer I would highly recommend skipping this place and heading down the street to Fido - insanely good coffee and great breakfast food."}
{"input": "I was with a client and some coworkers looking for a place to grab a late lunch downtown, we were striking out all over the place. We walked in and the owner and what looked like his mother were sitting there getting a bit of rest before dinner service. Instead of turning us away, they graciously sat us and served us a fantastic meal. The food was paced well and it was prepared fresh with great ingredients. The Taj saved the day and kept us out of some crappy chain restaurant in a strip mall. \n\nGet a mango lhassi. It was fantastic."}
{"input": "My son and I come here often and they never disappoint. Today I got something other than ice cream and the tenderloin sandwich was average but good. Ice cream heavenly as always. Love this place!"}
{"input": "Really good, fresh good. Wine and beer selections better than most 'strip mall' restaurants. Staff extremely friendly and helpful. This was my first trip so I'm looking forward to coming bak and trying about her tasty treat.\nThe chocolate cake is dark, moist and very good. Come enjoy."}
{"input": "Care more about your customers.\nI went to fresh healthy cafe for a mid morning smoothly with my wife. There was no one in the restaurant when we got there. I ordered a smoothy and my wife ordered a latte and a parfait. The parfaits are premade and quite good. The latte came out just as she was finishing her parfait (5 minutes ish), I continued to wait at least a couple of more minutes for my smoothy. I could have made it faster at home. When I did get it, it was not worth the wait. There was far too much ice... They give you a wide slurpy straw to make up for the increased ice volume, it's just not the consistency I like and had very little flavour because if the high ice volume.\n\nIt's nice to see a healthy option place in my new neighbourhood, but I hope that they vastly improve their service and quality."}
{"input": "I loved this place.  Walking by, I almost didn't go in, because Im a vegetarian and it looked like there was only meat on the menu. I'm glad that I looked closer. They have an excellent veggie burger, a terrific selection of local microbrews and they even make their own ice cream. I would definitely go back here again the next time I visit St. Louis."}
{"input": "There are a few things you expect from Chick-Fil-A, friendly service, good food, and a clean restaurant. This is the first time I've been to this new location, and it has absolutely lived up to the corporate standards, and exceeded them. \nI was at the front of the line only minutes after walking in, and the cashier, Carolina, was friendly and enthusiastic and made me feel very welcome there, unlike other fast food places where the cashiers seems bothered by your business. \nMy food was out in just a couple minutes, and it was hot, fresh, and tasty. \nThis Chick-Fil-a is a great and welcomed addition to Reno, and I hope it stays for a long, long time."}

{"input": "My boyfriend and I love this bar for its great location and reasonable prices. It's close to south street but far enough that it seems to deflect most of the craziness and for this reason it's a hidden gem. We've spent many afternoons watching games here and even had a great new years eve there this year."}
{"input": "Muy mal. Servicio y me robaron ordene un pastel para 30 personas y me dieron uno para 10 personas y muy mal sabor y mal decorado tenga cuidado con sus ordenes"}
{"input": "This place overall probably one of the best chill spots ever the bartenders are very personable. They remember their regulars. :) always have some random movie on thats always a nice ice breaker to talk to people huge selection of beers! What more do u want??"}
{"input": "Paid for non-smoking room but there was a smell and ashtrays in the room. Since all we were doing was sleeping there we didn't say anything. Shower was crazy slow to drain. Pillows were so lumpy that I woke up with a migraine. Room was clean and staff was nice. Free wifi but wouldn't connect."}
{"input": "Got the manager's recommendations on a full dinner spread for a group of 7.  Everything was perfectly prepared and true to its Greek roots. Tirokafteri dip was phenomenal on EVERYTHING we ate over the course of the meal and the honey-lemon chicken roasted on a charcoal rotisserie was outstanding.  The salad was super fresh and it's clear the place doesn't settle for less than high quality ingredients. \n\nHighly recommend!  Will be back when I'm in Nashville again."}
{"input": "Inspect your food before you put it in your mouth! Ordered the Spicy Tuna Roll last night and am now battling the worst case of food poisoning the world has ever known - think projectile vomiting- . The tuna was mushy and the color was too dark, like it had been sitting out at room temperature all day. This place needs to be inspected. Avoid this place."}
{"input": "Not a fan of cafeteria food so I will go easy on this place since it is well liked by the elderly masses.  The average age of the customers is probably close to 65. The staff is efficient and there are a decent amount of menu choices.  Not impressed with the quality of the food.  The pies look better than they taste.  Didn't try the fried chicken, but wish I had since it looked golden crispy and smelled delicious."}
{"input": "Petcetera always gives our cat a perfect lion cut, and the employees are always very nice."}
{"input": "You must stop here while in NOLA.  It's a small place, but you feel like you just stepped into a bar during prohibition. While we were there, there was an amazing Jazz band. There is also a small room off to the side where you can sit on a coach and sip your cocktail.\n\nThe Vieux Carre was excellent here!"}
{"input": "I've been to this place in numerous occasions and I have never been disappointed! My friend and I are traveling to Puerto Rico and my mother in law wanted Tamales! They were very accommodating and gave us free samples and offer to cook them and pack them for us! Great place and very friendly staff!"}
{"input": "This are awesome and so good! I love the BBQ pork one the best. The staff is so friendly. This is my first dive into Vietnamese cuisine and now I def. want to try more! The bubble tea is so good. I am glad there is another place in town to get the bubble tea. I never tried it before and I love it! They have fresh rolls that taste just as good as sit down Thai restaurants. I love that they will add extra jalapenos and usually not charge extra. They are fresh not pickled and sometimes has seeds which makes it even spicier which is good!! GO NOW! TO BAGUETTE DELI!!"}
{"input": "LOVE this place and have a constructive suggestion.\nI have to start by saying I've loved this place for several decades and will love it forever! However, on my last visit while we were eating inside the restaurant, I picked up a visitor that was not appreciated one bit--a BLACK WIDOW SPIDER on my purse. I noticed it as I was picking my purse up to leave and found I had set it on a HUGE web. As I looked closer, that web was not alone--there were many. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE get rid of these and clean regularly. I would like to eat my meals stress free! I would love to help clean this amazing place anytime."}
{"input": "Oh boy- where do I begin. How about with a warning- Don't waste your $ here. STAY AWAY. \n\nFirst, it's just plain ole too expensive. Period.\n\nSecond, the product is so average it's embarrassing. Fries were soggy, steak was chewy, bread was ok.\n\nFinally, the service and systems are a total cluster. Where do u stand? Where's my food? What is going on? Why did I come here??\n\nthe place LOOKS great!  It talks the talk. Unfortunately, it fails to walk the walk in any way."}
{"input": "This review is for those who normally purchase diamond club tickets.  My husband and I always purchase these types of tickets at every stadium we visit and they always include a very nice buffet before the game and then during the game servers bring you anything you want to eat and drink, free of charge.  Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and so many other stadiums know how to treat their big spenders, so I was rather surprised that Citizens Bank Park does none of this.  \n\nThere is a private lounge/restaurant area for diamond club ticket holders, but no pre-game complimentary buffet.  You have to pay for everything that is in there which is also the case for everything you order at your seat.  \n\nFor future games at Citizens Bank Park, I doubt we'll spend a lot of money again for diamond club seats that don't come with the perks that most other baseball  stadiums offer."}
{"input": "This is an all you can eat place that at $27/adult isn't bad.  But if you ordered from the regular menu, you come to realize just how mediocre the quality is.  Maki rolls are OK, but mine were so cold they had clearly been premade and sat in the fridge.  Oyster ponzu was missing the ponzu and the coating was really heavy - like an A+W onion ring. \n\nSo if you are really hungry and want to eat several plates of rolls and greasy tempura then this is for you. Granted sometimes that is just what you're craving. But avoid the squid."}
{"input": "A die hard Met fan, I came here with my sister on Mothers day to watch the Mets play your beloved Phillies.  Citizen's Bank Park is clearly one of the nicest parks in the MLB.  I was impressed with how easy it was to get to as well as the layout.  The park is not too big and it seems that every seat has a great view.  The fans were really respectful and enthusiastic for their home team (Mets won though!).  In addition, there is know doubt that the Philly Phanatic is the best mascot in baseball.  While I love Mr. Met, he can not compare to the fun antics of Phillies mascot.  Food was plentiful and of course pricey, but what isn't in the MLBs.  I will definitely be back.  Congratulations Philadelphia on a great stadium and fun team."}
{"input": "I was craving for Ramen when I found this gem, but it wasn't the Ramen that I'm rating here (it falls a bit short comparing to the Ramens I've had in NY). That Steven roll!!! That was one of the best rolls that I've had! Good thing I was pretty hungry and asked for roll recommendations. I was definitely not disappointed. I would love to come back once I visit Philly again."}
{"input": "Time flew by, You won't regret it! She did an awesome job! She will work with you to make them look natural. Call to make an appointment she's always book up."}
{"input": "I love El Sitio...in Isla Vista. I ordered a burrito with avocado, was charged extra for the avocado, and drove to work to eat a burrito with no avocado in it. The horchata was watery and not worth it. Try the El Sitio in Isla Vista: they are much more on top of it and the quality is better."}
{"input": "This is a review as someone who plays board games and paints miniatures. \n\nThis is a huge shop with some of the best prices in town. The selection of games is great. No Privateer Press miniatures or Malifaux and their GW is only some new stuff (though I am sure you can order through the shop). Their X-Wing selection is huge. The board game selection is big and literally wraps around the shop. Can be a bit intimidating checking out the games in the section where games are being played but it can be fun to watch other games being played. The staff is helpful but can seem absent since the shop is so huge. Lots of room to play games and meet up with folks to play."}
{"input": "College Hunks did everything that we asked for and did it professionally.  Wanya and Dean are very nice young men couldn't have been more pleasant.  Will use them again for future furniture swap outs!"}
{"input": "I absolutely loved this hotel.  There was a huge street party right near the hotel, and it did not bother us one bit.  It was a pleasant walk to the WWII museum and to many other places in the French Quarter.  We felt safe.  The hotel was clean and pleasant....really calming decor.  I found the front desk to be very helpful and eager to help.  \n\nThe breakfast was good.  My family enjoyed it, but there were no gluten free options except fruit."}
{"input": "Unbelievable! Some sports bar, $5 cover charge, got wanded for guns and they didn't have any sports on. They had a video looping of Mexican music. Maybe I went at the wrong time or it has vastly changed.\n\nBartenders were cute and friendly"}
{"input": "We stopped on our way through Indianapolis.  My husband ordered the ribeye.  I ordered fried shrimp.\n\nThe waitress made our salads from the salad bar--my salad had three huge chunks of lettuce in it from the core of the lettuce.  \n\nHis steak had good flavor and his baked potato was fine (since it's hard to screw up a baked potato)\n\nMy friend shrimp was overfried.  The rice pilaf was lumpy brown rice.  The applesauce was so sweet to be inedible.  \n\nI asked for rolls (which weren't brought with our meals) so I'd have a little more food to make up for that I didn't eat the rice pilaf or the applesauce and half my salad was the \"non-food\" part of the lettuce.\n\nWe go through that area frequently--but we won't stop there again.  I can't recommend it at all."}
{"input": "The absolute best service and results I've had & I have several vehicles.  HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"input": "Old-school style barbershop with modern conveniences.  Online appointment booking with email reminders, professional and friendly service. Great haircut.  Only downside is cash only, but there is a 7-11 right next door with an ATM ."}
{"input": "The ambiance at brunch today was soothing and the spirits of the staff were uplifting. Great prices, abundance of great food, beautiful interior, and located in a great neighborhood."}
{"input": "The price was as advertised. The service was top notch and the room was better than expected. Located right next to Bourbon Street and the Absinthe house. I will definitely stay here again."}
{"input": "Great food and staff! As this is a new place to the area, the staff takes time and explains menu options.   I like having this option in the area for lunch."}
{"input": "Britton's Archery is more than just a range and supply - it's a wealth of know-how and advice on what works. From prepping for your hunt (1st or 400th) to letting your first arrow fly on the range, George Britton can take care of you. \n\nI'm a novice archer, but my father-in-law is experienced and we both get so much out of our visits to Britton's - and so do my wife and our kids (9, 7 & 3). \n\nWhenever I'm in the neighborhood, I stop by Britton's."}
{"input": "BEST MARGHERITA PIZZA EVER!! I originally tried this place after buying a Groupon 6+ years ago. My wife is a vegetarian so we tend to always get a Margherita. We were blown away by the freshness and flavor of our pizza. The crust is perfectly thin and the ingredients are always so fresh. I think we've ordered the veggie pizza before but it's hard to get anything but the margherita. I highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"input": "Really poor seating management. 6:00 on a Sunday and the hostess has seated several parties of 2 at 4 tops leaving all the small tables open and no tables for larger parties. Then suggests I go eat at the bar with my minor children."}
{"input": "Finally I made my way to Elm Cafe! They post their delicious creations on twitter (@elmcafe), and I'd been meaning to stop by.\n\nAlthough the breakfast wrap options were tempting, I wasn't too hungry, so I ordered a peach-apple muffin since I don't often bake with peaches at home, and it was great! A good-sized muffin, so I had half then and saved half for later. Also grabbed a small cappuccino - perfect size, tasty and with coffee art.\n\nThere isn't a lot of space inside the cafe, about 4-5 bar stools, so I could see it getting crowded in busy hours. The woman at the counter was friendly. The other patrons were, too - when strangers are relaxed chatting with each other, I feel like I fit into the atmosphere of a venue.\n\nI'll be back for sure!"}
{"input": "In Reno for the night. Was a bit skeptical because well..it's Reno, but this place far exceeded expectations. Very good Taiwanese food compared to most places I've tried in different cities. My recommendations: 三杯鸡, oyster omlet, and scallion pancake. \n\nThere are many other dishes I wish I could try. Will definitely miss this place once I leave."}
{"input": "My husband, my 2 1/2 year old son and I really enjoyed our visit. Although it was a little over crowded we still had fun. Very clean place. Only thing I can complain about is it is a little pricey to eat here."}
{"input": "Nice location and very friendly device. The restaurant feels like you could actually be dining in Ethiopian. The food however is probably a 6/10 based on several other Ethiopian restaurants we have eaten at. The lack flavor and taste. It's a reasonable restaurant for sure but again quite average - nothing special."}
{"input": "Love this bakery!! Great breakfast sandwiches, coffee, and donuts! My friend and I love coming on weekend mornings"}
{"input": "Relaxing atmosphere with delicious food. Had the Chicken Teriyaki and the dumplings. Everything was fresh and made quickly."}
{"input": "Sooooo good! \nFav spot downtown.\nClassy, intimate and more quiet than most dining places. \nDrinks are phenomenal I recommend the margarita! \nThey have a great dining room tons of booths. \nAlso they do rooftop dining. \n\nEnjoy your experience here!!"}
{"input": "We have gone on several Carnival cruises from the port here. We always had a good a time and met nice folks. The food is decent, not great. The entertainment is good. The rooms are small, but you do not spend much time in the room. The cabin staff was great, as was all the service.The opportunities for fun are totally unlimited in port or on the ship. We have now tried some other lines and some of them have nicer amenities, but we had a lot of fun on Carnival."}
{"input": "We went to Bailey's Range to have dessert with friends we haven't seen in years from different states. We came on a Thurs night and there was plenty of space to sit, but somewhat busy. We were a party of 11 with little ones. The hostess was super friendly at first and said she would get us a table right away but after we told her we were looking to have ice cream for dessert it took her close to 20 minutes and talking to the manager 2x to finally seat us at the empty very long \"community table\". Ice cream was average nothing special. The only saving grace of this experience was our waitress Alexandra who was super attentive and friendly. If it wasn't for her I would give this place 1 star, but because of her I would give this place another chance if I'm ever back in the area again. Has potential if the hostess and manager can get customer service concept down or be forthright and tell us plainly they don't serve large parties just for dessert so we don't waste our time next time."}
{"input": "Do yourself a favor and never ever order the breaded chicken. It was served black, extremely overcooked to the point where I started to question what kind of meat it actually was. As far as the texture - it would make a nice hockey puck for the NHL. It definitely might not be one of their more common orders but take it off the menu if you have no idea how to make it."}
{"input": "This was a nice spot with sidewalk lounge seating. Even had a DJ outside Friday night. There was a walk up bar outside too. The decor inside was pretty sweet. We tried a few appetizers and they were both good! It is located in a trendy waterfront area."}
{"input": "It came down to price...this place is waaay, way overpriced for the quality of food, the service, and the location (D-Town vs. Philly).  No wonder the place was empty on a Saturday night.  Any successful restaurant in Doylestown should be packed on a weekend.  I'll admit the salad menu is fantastic; still over priced though.  Your money will go as far if not farther in a fancier French restaurant in Philly.  I hope this place can turn itself around with dishes that taste better that won't break the bank."}
{"input": "Stopped by for lunch....best decision we have made in a while, this place rocks!  Ribs, chicken, and sausage were delicious.  We asked for the Mac N Cheese that is normally only served on Friday, and they happily made it for us.  Bake beans with some sort of cinnamon are great, and we loved the spicy BBQ....but beware, probably only want to use a little bit, this stuff will light your mouth up!!!!  Thanks Al's for a great unexpected meal."}
{"input": "Custard was pretty good! What's shocking was, it was 8pm on December 30th and there must have been 50 people in line! Seems the locals love it."}
{"input": "My friend and I took the ghost tour with Judy Bajoie last week while we were in town and it was AWESOME. Judy was an amazing and knowledgable tour guide. She was so much fun. Loved this!  I would definitely recommend it and Judy!"}
{"input": "I had high expectations going into this ice cream parlor after reading several excellent reviews and every expectation was met leaving the parlor. The ice cream I chose was the blueberry cheesecake in a waffle cone and it was absolutely amazing! I honestly want to drive a hour back to Nashville just to go and get another scoop of it! Lol! It was so delicious and I highly recommend this place!"}
{"input": "Staying at the Sheraton at University City, and was looking for a place that was easy to walk and fairly close.  Tried Han Dynasty last night partly because it was recommended by the hotel as well as a couple that was in the elevator.\n\nInteresting that there were three noodle shops with 2 or 3 city blocks.  I really enjoyed the appetizers (dumplings in chili oil) and the entree (garlic chicken).  I know, I know, I was looking for noodles and ended up without.  I think this was mostly because as I was looking at the menu, plates kept going by me, steaming of fresh, Chinese wok flavors. I couldn't resist but to try a little of this and a little of that.\n\nMeal was hot, fresh, flavorful and an excellent recommendation.\n\nOn a down side, as I have noticed on this trip, the customer service, servers, waiters don't seem too excited to be working.  They seem tired, uninterested and could care less of your/my experience.  Maybe this is normal in Philly?"}
{"input": "There is nothing like the other pics showed!!! I never give out review on Yelp, but I had to comment on this restaurant! I am a sushi lover, the fish was poorly cut and the sushi rice is tasteless. The dynamite we had was extremely salty and loads of mayos. I took one bite left the rest on the table. This is the worst experience l've ever had in a 4.5 star restaurant, please avoid at all cost!!!"}
{"input": "Gas here was very reasonable at $2.12 a gallon and service at the pump was friendly.  It's NJ so they pump for you.   This was the same price for cash or credit.   The name Hyatt is on the building.   The marquee/sign at the street reads \"XTRA Power.\""}
{"input": "Harry's blue bell is a nice spot. We stopped a few days ago for a quick dinner. It's tucked in the corner of a shopping center and it's very easy to miss. It was packed and seemed like the place to be for locals. The inside is nice but small, only a few tables in the entire place. The service was just okay. \n\nThe beer selection is very good as are the prices on the beer. The food menu was a bit limited with you're basic bar food. The wife went with the bbq pulled pork and I went with the chicken and honey mustard wrap. The bbq pork was good, the bun was nicely toasted but the sauce was overly sweet for our liking. The wrap was fresh and good but nothing spectacular. The fries were hot and crispy. The kale slaw was fantastic but a very small portion.\n\nOverall it was a decent meal. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back. If I were in the area I'd stop though. Solid 3 stars."}
{"input": "Burgers are large and tasty. Staff are courteous and friendly. I would definitely come here instead of Bobby's or Shakeshack. Unfortunately, I currently don't live in Philly and will have to wait until next time to try out the rest of the menu. \n\nJust a heads up, my burger got a bit messy to eat, but it was worth it. Get Ziggy with it..."}
{"input": "Delicious, fresh, and friendly volunteers. Yesterday was my second trip to Hollygrove farmers market. The produce is fresh and organic. The volunteers were nice and helpful. Their tomatoes and curly kale is delicious. Oh and the cucumbers were yummy, big, and crisply fresh. I also purchased zucchini and fairytale eggplant, anhich I haven't tasted yet"}
{"input": "Outstanding food and decor. This place is a gem. I would drive over here from San Francisco to eat. It is that good. I will definitely be back."}
{"input": "My family has been frequenting Double Greeting for years!!  I have loved the food and two of the long-standing waitresses, however, in the last year, the quality of the food and service has drastically taken a nose dive.\nLast night I was dining with my parents and my 8 year old son.  As usual, we were browsing the menu and my son suddenly screeched and yelled \"Mom!  A cricket!\"  It wasn't a cricket - it was a cockroach.  I smashed it with my menu and it fell on to our table where I proceeded to conceal it in a napkin.  My dad asked that I not say anything or make a scene, so out of respect, I didn't, however, that bug was the last straw for me.  I will not be returning to this restaurant - I can deal with the occasional crappy service, but where there is one bug, somewhere nearby there are many."}
{"input": "Been here twice in the past 2 years and both times the food was excellent! Roast beef sandwich - A+. Fried oysters - A+. Grilled chipotle-bourbon Wings - A+. This is far more than typical bar food. Most recent visit was 11/26. After our meal we asked for a couple of Jaegers and the manager(?) suggested an alternative. I wish I could remember what it was called. It was delicious AND he gave it to us on the house! Great food,  great service, great location!!"}
{"input": "Today I had my second appointment at this Salon. I had Drea for color and Morgan for cut. Morgan is at the $55 level. She did an awesome job and gave me exactly what I asked for. It turns out she and I have the exact same type of hair (fine and a lot of hair) so she knew just how to handle it. Drea did my color. I asked for my natural color and to cover my gray. The color turned out perfect. I had actually asked for something a tad darker but she knew that it would look it be a little extreme. What I got was perfect for my fair skin. I'll be back to see both ladies!"}
{"input": "Love this place.  Best view in Santa Barbara.   Awesome wines.  My wife and I are industry, and always treated great.  Tom and Gillian are ALWAYS generous hosts.  My wife works @carrwinery and always refers customers to them.  The Conway cabs are the best SB has to offer.  One of their tasting room employees just gifted us a Conway 13 reserve Syrah.  Beautiful. ...  Thank you Tommy.   Rolos red is a bottle that any wine snob would love,  but a great bottle for those finding their pallet as well.  My son is 5 and always wants mom and dad to go wine tasting when we hit the pier. Never disappointed."}
{"input": "My husband and I have eaten at M3 at least six times, and each meal has been delicious. The mini tacos with braised beef are a meal, as is the quesadilla. I recommend ordering them with a side of M3's slaw, which is a fresh blend of apples, carrots and cabbage. The Pasta Rustico is outstanding and something you can't get anywhere else. We've tried three sandwiches: lamb burger, prime rib dip and bacon & cheese melt. We recommend all of them. I'll gladly add the 5th star as soon as they develop a cocktail menu. :)"}
{"input": "Had a very memorable birthday in SB and was so happy to have Wine Edventures be my gift! Sean picked us up Saturday morning and was super friendly (funny, too). It was just my husband and I along with a group of 10 - who happened to be all guys, having a bachelor party! Haha, so that was pretty funny. We stopped at 3 wineries and 1 brewery. Sean explained where we were as we were driving around and also gave us lessons at the tastings. He provided us with bottled water and souvenir wine glasses. We had lunch at the 2nd vineyard of the day, which was very good - choice of sandwich and a pasta salad side with chips and a cookie (the cookies are awesome). It was a fun day and I'd highly recommend this adventure to anyone looking for a fun day in the SB area."}
{"input": "Awesome food! It was so fresh and delicious. The papaya salad was delicious! Try the curry..simply spicy and beautiful. The service was great too! They have take out!!!"}
{"input": "After another visit, I'm bumping Batter'd & Fried up to a 4.  The sushi is better than a lot of places, and while it's not the BEST sushi in Nashville, it's plenty good and reasonably priced.  And I really dig the atmosphere.  See my original review for a more complete description of likes and dislikes."}
{"input": "First time I went to Earl's new American kitchen I liked the food it was good wasn't great but it was a ok \n service not so great sat at the bar did not really care for a bartender tried it again second time bartender was really rude I would never go back there  or Recommend it to anyone"}
{"input": "This place is smack dab in the middle of DA HOOD! The menu offerings are quite extensive and everything is made when you order.  The subs come in 3 sizes and even the \"small\" is quite large.  \nThe subs are loaded with meats and cheese and additional items if you want them.  I will be back to try more!"}
{"input": "Had 2 mac and cheese dogs. Now I'm hooked. Cant beat a combination of bacon + mac and cheese. Can't wait to try other secret menu items (Follow their Instagram for their secret menu options) They don't have every item every night but hey that makes me wanting to go back to try them when they are available!"}
{"input": "We came to the District Tavern for a quick bite before a concert at the Amalie. We sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and helpful. \nIt was around 6 pm, so we reached for the happy hour menu (4-7 pm M-F).  Both my friend and I got the Tavern Jalapeño Margarita. I think this is my new favorite drink! Slightly spicy with charred lemon and unique deep flavor. Most importantly- not sweet! Perfection!\nWe shared the sandwich shooters. They are the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars. I had higher expectations. The tomato bisque was kinda bland, and the baguettes were not anything to write home about. For my main entree i had the Southwest bowl- delicious! Great flavors, generous portion and nice presentation. My friend got the district salad with salmon and she was very happy with her choice too. I'd definitely come back again for the jalapeño margarita and to try something else on the menu. \nTip-you can take the Downtowner to and from here!"}
{"input": "Great family restaurant feel. Po boys had the perfect bread. We had 3 different kinds and all were tasty. Mac 'n Cheese was good and a little spicy. Really fabulous service."}
{"input": "Pros: I don't think there's a bad seat to be had at this park. On the day I visited at least, the bathrooms were clean.  Easy to get to; super close to a septa stop. Cons: so expensive!"}
{"input": "Went here today with my family and I must say its not too often you get good chipotle. At least not for me. The service was great! They were all super friendly and didn't give attitude when we asked for more of something which is always a plus haha. The inside is really nice.. Absolutely love the ambiance! I got my regular, the veggie bowl and it was really good!"}
{"input": "Great food. Good drinks. Fair service.  Little too stiff of an atmosphere.  Maybe dim the lights and play some warmer tunes."}
{"input": "Great family owned restaurant with fantastic mexican food and BYO (T).  Medium sized restaurant with two separate dining areas, good for large groups as you can reserve the entire back room.\n\nThe service is fantastic, even when we've shown up 20 minutes prior to closing time, the wait staff was still incredibly hospitable.  The margaritas they mix are great, which is saying something as I typically don't enjoy margaritas.  The food is delicious, and parking is very easy in the area.  If you find yourself in Northern Liberties, give it a try!  They frequently run specials on Groupon and Living Social, so keep your eyes open and save a few bucks!"}
{"input": "Excellent if pricey meal in a tiny room, a little too close to the neighbors, but a great BYOB none-the less. We enjoyed the Bloody Beet Steak, Tom Culton's Salsify, Pappardelle Duck Ragu, Wild Striped Bass and Old Spot Pig Sirloin and Jowl. Everything was super delicious, and very well presented, with perhaps the Winter Vegetable Salad a bit disappointing - more a matter of my choice than the dish itself."}
{"input": "Amazingly awesome! Tried a couple of different things, everything was delicious! Their Bloody Mary was one of the worst I've ever had, but I didn't go there to drink, and besides that not what they are known for. Their mojoto are good tho."}
{"input": "This place has all you really need: hotdogs, bomb relish, and beer. Oh, and it's open late. The variety of dogs is cool, and I haven't had one that I don't like. The location is prime for late night noms. I've always had great customer service there, and speed of service is good, but not great. I heard there was new management and the last time I went I noticed faster service. Keep it up!"}
{"input": "I came here for a work dinner and we all enjoyed ourselves. Our service was pretty good! He was really nice and answered our questions but he did offer to go over the specials. I mean the specials were listed at the table but I thought It was weird he didn't say anything about them. The waiter said the rigatoni was their most popular dish, so naturally I ordered It. I thought It was good but safe, It wasn't busting with flavor. My coworker ordered the octopus ink pasta and said he felt like It was undercooked. Overall, I enjoyed the restaurant and I would go back!"}
{"input": "First off, the service was wonderful! They were always checking on us and we didn't have to ask for our server to come. I was excited to go to this place because everyone said that the ramen was good here and it did not fail my expectations. I have tried three of the ramens on the menu and they were the best. The first taste when I drank the broth made me finish the whole bowl! I enjoyed everything about this place and wish it grows with more ramen to its menu."}
{"input": "This is a place you would usually just pass by but don't, the pho is to die for! The broth is so flavorful!"}
{"input": "Food good steak and chicken well cooked. Hibachi chef put on a great show.when they say to try to catch saki as they squeeze it out of a bottle it is real saki."}
{"input": "I have been going to Mimosa for waxing for a few years now. I have always had a good experience and left a happy customer!\n\nI was in over the weekend for a wax and realized the next day that there was still some hair left behind, so I left a voicemail with the issue on a day they were closed. \nI was pleased when they contacted me bright and early the next business day, and promptly got me in for a touch-up wax, free of charge.\n\nVery pleased with how they handled the situation, I will continue going there for years to come!"}
{"input": "Although I have yet to personally purchase anything from here, my boyfriend is a regular. This is basically THE place to go if you are in Tucson and own a VW. Those are always breaking down, and Chirco always has the parts or can find you the parts to fix just about anything. My boyfriend has a VW Rail and a '65 bug, so we are there a lot. Once a year in October they have Bugtoberfest which is a huge VW show that folks come from afar to be a part of. Really neat stuff, and usually some very rare cars will be there. They have a swapmeet around the back where you can pick up some cheap stuff, and also camping on the side for the out of towners. This is the show to go to if you are interested in purchasing an older VW.  If you talk to the guys at the store about things you are looking for, they will keep an eye out for things for you. My boyfriend recently got a great deal on paddle tires from one of the guys there."}
{"input": "This place is a hidden gem on the Westside of Tucson. Great food at a reasonable price. I highly recommend the the Indian taco and their sweet fry bread in delicious. They also have daily specials like my favorite $1 tacos on Tuesday and Fridays. I eat here at least once a week."}
{"input": "Remarkably decent and affordable, particularly for a chain restaurant, with friendly service and a welcoming atmosphere. A good place for everyday dining (if just slightly pricier than average) as well as larger parties. Basically, a good meal for a good price with good service."}
{"input": "I had the classic burger and fries. Overall pleased with my experience. The burger was well seasoned and the fries were pretty tasty. The service was on point. Also had to have a spiked milkshake....my choice the Bananas Foster."}
{"input": "Place seriously needs to reevaluate how they take orders. Why is it my order needs to be complete before I can pay? They need to put 2 Eggs on their sandwiches like most breakfast places. Not the worst but I've had much better."}
{"input": "OK...I went on the tour to get some free beers. However, I never get tired of seeing the Clydesdales, the bottling plant and just how clean and organized everything is at the brewery. If Mickey Mouse could drink, he'd hang out at this place because it's a lot like Disney's prim and proper order.\n\nThe staff is always friendly and well rehearsed. They know their beer facts. Which leaves me with one more point: The hospitality room. Order up two fresh beers on tap, munch on some pretzels and kick back for about 20 minutes. Ahh!"}
{"input": "I was very disappointed with the cake I ordered. I picked it up at the shop. The service was very slow and I paid for the cake before I picked it up. I sat there for 10-15 minutes just for someone to wrap a bow around the already boxed cake. I ordered the White and Black Cake. The icing was not sweet at all and it was greasy. The cake was heavy and did not have much of a flavor. The cake was certainly not worth $70."}
{"input": "Absolutely delicious restaurant! Loved our server as well, he was extremely chill. Stupendous Service. Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because it is a tourist-trap place that has astronomically priced meals. You're probably going to get that anywhere in this area of the city though. However, if you're wanting to try any Creole/New Orleans-specific means; they have it here. Great place to go if you're wanting to get a flavor for NOLA!"}
{"input": "Can only say good things about this place.\nWe dined here twice, both times during a seasonal menu tasting at the counter.  The food is excellent, I've opted for the beer list on my visits while my wife has tried (and loved) the wine pairings.\nWe don't get out a ton and like to try new places but I'm positive we will keep returning here.  Also looking forward to Kevin's new place The Fat Ham."}
{"input": "I usually stay at The Grand Sierra.  It is where I taught my son to swim years ago, so I have been biased to that property.  However, with it under construction recently, and after they took the horse statues out of the Valet area, and began major construction, I decided to try the Peppermill by a friends suggestion.  The Operations Manager, David Fuller went above and beyond to make my stay unbelievably excellent.  We were met at the hotel and \"double\" upgraded to a Tuscany Balcony Suite at check-in.  Needless to say, it had a balcony.  Very cool!  The room upgrade started my trip off on a perfect note.  Thank you Peppermill!  I will be back.  My experience was better than expected thanks in part to the staff going the extra mile for us."}
{"input": "I dropped off a suit that I needed cleaned last week and was told to pick it up on Friday. When I came in I was told it wasn't ready yet and I could pick it up on Saturday. I come back on Saturday to find them closed for 3 days. Now I have to go buy a new suit for a funeral today. This is very unacceptable"}
{"input": "Hello James, \nI'll stop to eat next trip to Philadelphia - you make it sound welcoming!  Thanks for responding."}
{"input": "Went here this Friday and had Rendang. Okay food (worth the price). Horrible service. Servers took turn to rush us by constantly asking if we were finished while we clearly were not. When we were done, we had separate checks. One friend tipped 10% for it and had a female server chased us down outside and COMMANDED (exact words: \"COME HERE!\" with a frown on her face) my friend to come back inside and QUESTIONED her with rudeness why she didn't tip 15%. My friend who used to work at a country club didn't even bother to explain to her what is actual serving. By this time, I was truly regretful for tipping at all. Don't get me wrong, the food is not bad, but not worth the service that we had. We would never visit this place again."}
{"input": "We had a reservation and were seated immediately upon arrival. The menu consists of small plates, so really nice for sampling a number of different items on the menu. We tried the sliders, fish tacos, fries and mac&cheese, all of which were pretty good. There was a lovely duo playing during our dinner and it was nice that we were able to enjoy the music and still have a conversation. \nA few tips if you have never been here before:\n- Make sure you have a reservation or be subject to dine/stand at the bar.\n- Even with a reservation, you are instructed to complete your dining within 90 minutes of being seated. Understandable. \n- Try everything!"}
{"input": "The service was so very bad. We walked out after waiting half an hour for any food to appear. Avoid this place."}
{"input": "Inedible & FDA Beware! \n\nLe Saigon wins the #1 prize of being the most inconsiderate, rude, and unsafe restaurant on the main line.  The produce, meats, and other ingredients used by the owner of Le Saigon is cheap, expired, and extremely unsafe.  The food is horribly prepared and lacks any flavor.  \n\nThe service is rude.  I bet you Le Saigon will have the same fate at Yangming, that is, it will be shut down by the FDA.  \n\nAn embarrassment to the Main Line restaurants."}
{"input": "Amazing pizza. Also love ceci bean dip. Great outdoor patio.  Recommend going on Tuesdays for half off select pizzas."}
{"input": "Everyone at Luxe is so nice and friendly compared to many other salons that I've been to. I came here for the first time after a recommendation about their stiletto nail abilities. They have the largest collection of gel polishes I've ever seen. You'll definitely be able to find a color in gel lacquer. Lana does great simple designs by hand; I usually just get something geometric. \n\nThe only problem I have is confusion about their pricing. I got gel overlay for $26. I thought the rate was GREAT and was very excited to have found a reasonable, friendly place. Then I went back for the second time and I obviously had to get the previous color off. My total came out to be $44. Not sure how. I was running so late for my next appointment that I didn't have time to question it. \n\nTip: They don't accept tips on your card. Have cash.\n\nEDIT 10/2013: They are now cash only."}
{"input": "Great customer service! Love my new car! Highly recommend to anyone who's trying to buy a new used car in good shape! Talk to Andy if you want some good help!"}
{"input": "Overprice Greek diner with a \"Sports Bar\"attached, neither of which are well executed. Better places in the area to watch a game or eat. PLUS the decor is shall I say downright GAUDY. If you like lots of chrome, it's you're home."}
{"input": "I'm in town for an OB/GYN conference and really wanted to explore the local gems - oh Yelp you make travel so much better.  I was on my way to grab lunch and passed by a cute window display and decided I would come their for dessert and coffee.  \n\nI'm a coffee snob - Peet's in the Bay Area, Intelligencia in Chicago, Dunn Bros. etc.. and the coffee here was pretty good - just a shade lighter roast than Peets.  \n\nI also picked up some Amaretti cookies to share but once I tried them decided to keep them \n- light airy buttery almond flavored little circles of joy.  \n\nI plan to go back before I leave and get some delicious treats to take home!"}
{"input": "So I'm walking around looking for a place to eat and stop in here because it's not a chain type place, looks local. So I sit by the fish tank in the middle of a bunch of dirty tables, order some food from a menu the I had to get myself and has to many items on it for everything be good so I play it safe and order a beer and some fried food. I'm sitting at the table for 10mins Questioning why I'm not drinking my beer the bar was not busy and the bartender was not busy so I just walked out."}
{"input": "Was very excited to have this restaurant open a location in Goleta. My family enjoys take out from here on occasion. The food is always excellent and the staff is very friendly."}
{"input": "One of our regular joints for takeout. The meat is tender and always juicy.  The portions are large, which matters to me as I have quite an appetite! The wait can be long, but totally worth it. \n\nLove this place!"}
{"input": "We don't get out too much anymore so we were so excited to try Charro Steak & wanted to love it so bad. But the experience was just not a good one. We made reservations and upon arrival they sat us at a table near the very back, right by the chef's work table. My husband wanted to sample a beer before ordering drinks and it came warm, at which time he was informed that all the beers would be warm because they were having some kind of issue with the tap system. No big deal but also not ideal. So I ordered the pinot noir on tap and it came chilled?! Which again was fine but weird since the beer was warm.\n\nService wasn't great. The ambiance wasn't ideal. The chef cut the steak right behind us which was loud and they also had a staff meeting right next to us which was just odd and awkward. \n\nThe filet was really good but otherwise the food was only OK. \n\nOverall it wasn't a BAD experience but it just wasn't good either. I wouldn't recommend it because there are just too many better places to go!"}
{"input": "Popped in for \"all-day breakfast\" recently & realized it's a very limited breakfast menu. Wish it was the full menu all day! The manager was very helpful & attentive. The other employees weren't great. The main dining area was clean & tidy but the side area was messy & not very clean. My food came out hot & fresh though, so I'm happy about that!"}
{"input": "This is a fantastic hole in the wall diner. We got here aroumd 9 and even though they were very busy, we got taken back in under 3 minutes. We got seated outside and i had no idea that there as a view! It was beautiful and breezy. The server was really nice and quick. The food was really great and still warm and fresh when brought to us. After an awful experience at iHop and rude servers, im glad i found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"input": "Probably the best overall hotel in Reno. I had free nights at the Peppermill so I decided to used them. The hotel room was quite nice and spacious. In the room some snacks but if you touch them you will by charged. Oh well who goes to Reno to stay in the Hotel room. This hotel has many chapels, has a spa massage and gaming. What I really like is the pool area. The pool and spa are just wonderful. Peppermill has a large heated pool area designed for play. The lower pool seems to be the family pool with an older crowd on the upper deck. There is a bar and drink service poolside, perfect for all day lounging. You can also check out their spa for treatments and a private indoor pool area during those cold Nevada winters. Indoor, I'll remain outside, it was under 20 degrees outside and it was so relaxing to be in a steaming hot tub."}
{"input": "I met a buddy mine at this spot that I have always wanted to go to, but have never had the time. I walked in and sat at the bar. The police were investigating a burglary from the overnight it seemed some dirt bags broke in on a side door and stole a bunch of liquor from the bar. The bartender was great and service was prompt. I ordered a pint  of dark ale and my buddy and I split a order of wings. The beer was cold and the wings were very tasty. I remembered meeting the owners of the establishment at the last Italian Fest at the Farmers Market so I really wanted to like this place as they were very friendly folks. I will continue to patronize this spot as it was a great spot close to home and work. I also like the locally non franchised making it work attitude that this place gives. I really was very comfortable at this establishment and well tell the rest of fellow Yelpers to hit this spot!!!"}
{"input": "The best pho I've tried in Reno. I'm picky, from SF, nothing matches SF but this pho is pretty damn good, favorite spot on a cold day"}
{"input": "OK, I have to confess, Jimboy's tacos are about as greesy as it gets, probably as bad for you as it gets, but they are my guilty pleasure.  I love them!  It's true love.  I can't help it.  It's a relationship that started back in high school when I used to get brain-dead-stoned after school and then go to Jimboys to eat all the tacos I could stuff down my throat. There is something about the greesy meat and cheese with the shell that's covered in parmasean cheese; it's soooo incredible.  It's my \"White Castle.\"  I no longer indulge in the Ganja substance abuse beforehand, but the tacos are almost as good without it."}
{"input": "This place is a horror show.\n\nYou're on camera 100% of the time, which they remind you of constantly by putting the CCTV screens in your face just like a check-cashing place. You may be watched the entire time you're there, but not a single person in an orange apron is going to ask if you need anything. They're content to willfully ignore most customers as they chat amongst themselves at the ends of the aisles.\n\nI tried to pay for my $200+ worth of bits and drivers, sockets and keys, which took me over an hour to get together because I was never asked if I needed help and when I finally asked, he didn't have a clue what I was talking about. I tried to use the self checkout; the attendant canceled my order twice after I'd checked about half of the little bits. Extenders. Sockets. LOTS of little items. When she told me to start again for the THIRD time, I walked out.\n\nNever again."}
{"input": "Our initial contact with the waiter was disappointing as he did not smile and was quite unfriendly. We were the only table in the restaurant and our single appetizer took 20 minutes followed by a 4 0minute wait for our lunch. The 1/4 chicken had no flavor and the rice was bland. Cute place but with numerous great restaurants in Nashville I will not return to any of them if first impression is an epic fail."}
{"input": "The food was wonderful.  My boyfriend and I both felt pressured by the waiter to order things that we didn't necessarily want though... I mean, it was great and we enjoyed eating it, however, we felt like there was a \"sales pitch\" to order things.  I didn't really like that part of our dining experience."}
{"input": "How do these guys not have any reviews yet?! Anna photographed our wedding in June of this year. She was absolutely fantastic. From the moment I chatted with her on the phone, I knew she'd be our gal for the big day. She was SO easy to talk to, none of her photos seem fake or posed, she was fun, got right in the center of things and delivered absolutely beautiful photos. I'm a gal who doesn't like to have her picture taken very much (not an especially great quality for a bride...) and she made it easy on me by getting great photos of our guests and family members (and of course, great ones of me and my fella...) Great communication the whole time, too. She was absolutely delightful and I'd recommend her to any couple looking for their photographer."}
{"input": "This place is bananas. I've never had anything bad and most of the time my mind is blown by the innovation and deliciousness of the food. Occasionally I am disappointed by the size of a dish but generally not. \n\nService is top notch although not terribly fast. Expect to wait awhile for a coffee drink other than brewed coffee but it will be worth the wait. \n\nLove the building. Love that the menu changes regularly although sometimes I miss an old favorite. \n\nWait for seating can be longish so don't go if you're in a huge hurry. They do have a counter and a community table, which speed things up a bit if you don't mind that."}
{"input": "The beer is great and so is the atmosphere. The service leaves something to be desired. My husband ordered a beer and got it. He ordered a 2nd and did not ever get it from the server. It was a big group of people but still. At the end of the night the server is settling up and says you had 2 right, and he said he never received the 2nd. She said something about being out the money so he said fine just charge me. When she came back with the bill he signed and then realized she had actually charged him for 4 beers. He was trying to be nice so she wouldn't be in trouble and it backfired."}
{"input": "I visited the new Paoli location. BIG selection of tasty donuts. It's about time--the cardboard impostors found at Dunkin are so lame compared to these beauties. Salted Caramel, Bacon Maple, Lemon--now you're talking my language. Breakfast sandwiches, muffins, and bagels, oh my."}
{"input": "It was ok. I wasn't all that into the buffet. The food was bland, however,  it was fresh. I loved the history photos on their walls and I love the tile designs on the ceiling. Food was just ok and bland my waitress was normal. Very small inside so grab your seats when you can."}
{"input": "We had a great 3 course meal.  Or at least it took that long.  50 minutes to be seated even with tables open.  Another hour and a half to complete the meal.  Food was adequate by then they argued about their coupons.  Thumbs down.  Won't be back again.  I wish I could give this zero stars but then it wouldn't count as a review."}
{"input": "I am positively LIVID.\n\nI went to check my account balance and what do I see? An overdraft fee of $220.\nHow could this happen? My card was never declined and there are two large fees deducted from my account.\n\nI called TD and sat on hold for 45 MINUTES. I don't have that kind of time. Granted, the guy that was with me was nice and helpful, but never mentioned anything about the wait time until I brought it up. I asked about these fees and he said \"Just so you are aware, TD Bank's new policy is that when you have insufficient funds, your card will not be declined. It will be run through, and you will be charged an overdraft fee.\"\nOH THANK YOU FOR TELLING ME NOW, JERK.\n\nI have too many salty words that are unacceptable in the public domain, so I'll stop now.\n\nNeedless to say, I am switching banks.\n\nSort of UPDATE:\nI thought you Yelpers would like to know that last night, when I was depositing the cash that I didn't have into my account via ATM, I flipped off the cameras.\nTAKE THAT, TD."}
{"input": "My family was visiting the area on vacation and got tip from a local to try out the boardwalk. It's located in a strip mall, which made us a little leery at first, but it was all around an amazing experience. The service was awesome and the food was very underpriced for the quality and amount. Try the potato grouper... One of the best fish I've ever had. Oh! And they also have live music, an outdoor patio and a great burger special on Thursday nights. Cheers!"}
{"input": "Southern Transit Repair refinished a large curio cabinet that had belonged to my mother-in-law.  The cabinet was very outdated because of the light wood and a door had been damaged during a move.  After we bought new dining room furniture the curio stuck out like a sore thumb. It was recommended to me to call Southern Transit Repair to see if they could refinish it. After getting a quote they picked up the piece along with a leaf from the table to match the finish.  The end result is absolutely beautiful.  The curio looks like it came with the dining room furniture as a set and everyone in the family complements the new look.  Southern Transit Repair is not only professional in their estimating, moving, and delivery, they are also very friendly and provide high quality work.  I would recommend them to anyone trying to update an old piece of furniture and I'm looking forward to them resurfacing my kitchen cabinets."}
{"input": "I went here based off of reviews... the place was not bad- but I went in expecting more. I think a 3 star review is appropriate based off of the meal I had... which was a skillet so potatoes, sausage , eggs, tomatoes, cheese with a muffin and a side of grits...pretty simple--  so maybe the other reviews were based off of specialties..."}
{"input": "Not only is this the best Thai food you will find in the growing metropolis of Columbia, but it's the best Thai food you'll find in the entire STL area. This is a restaurant worth crossing the river for, you won't regret it. Whatever your favorite Thai dish is, they got it cooked to perfection. Warning:  the spice levels can vary depending upon the cook, so if spicy foods aren't your thing, tread lightly."}
{"input": "Literally walked in here. There were 4 patrons being helped. I looked at my watch and waited 18 minutes. No workers even looked in my direction to try to help nor acknowledge me in that time frame. After almost 20 minutes of being the only person in line, I walked right out. BYE!!"}
{"input": "Oh Whole Foods, how I loathe you, yet somehow I can't resist going here at least once every two weeks. First of all, I will say that I've only eaten from their hot-food island (or whatever you call it) once, because it was so bland, yet so EXPENSIVE, that I never wanted to try anything else they offer. Having said that, I must say that their seafood soups are quite tasty, especially the lobster bisque, but they are also so astronomically priced that I can rarely afford to indulge. The only time when I buy something at Whole Foods is when it's on sale or from their bargain cheese bin (which everyone should check out if they go here... great deals!). Actually, one star is just for the bargain cheese bin. Without that, it would definitely only get two."}
{"input": "Ate here prior to Hurricane Katrina and it was great. We returned somewhat disappointed. I had the meatloaf as featured on The Travel Channel....seasoned with SALT. The mustard greens salty and hubby's red beans n rice was bean flavored only. Not a NOLA experience at all. The fried chicken was a hit...but who can really screw that up. Sadly done."}
{"input": "I stopped here because it was by the hotel I was staying in. The guys working at the shop were super nice and friendly. I really like the buy one get one deal they do. I also ordered some hot wings and they were pretty good. They had a ton of sauce on them which is awesome. Next time I come back to town I will be sure to stop here for some more pizza!"}
{"input": "Nice enough ambiance - looks very promising on first glance, but the food and service were a huge disappointment. I ordered the steak sandwich because of the promising ingredients (I like strongly seasoned dishes) but was SMACKED in the face with a single note - BEEF. Chewy, chewy beef. \nThis was especially disappointing because I was torn between several sandwiches. The waitress, however, was disinterested and absent almost our whole meal (the bus person was diligent and pleasant) and completely uninterested in addressing the questions I had about the choices. \nWould definitely not come again and would recommend skipping it."}
{"input": "This place is very good and consistent. Their ginger salad dressing might be the best I've had. I always get the pork katsu cause it's just that good. Solid sushi selection too."}
{"input": "I would eat anything they served me. I haven't even had the pancakes yet and I'm sold. The line out the front door and down the sidewalk should be an indication that this place is awesome. I just had basic hashbrowns eggs and bacon, but it was so fab and the service was great! I will definitely go back and sit down to eat. Parking is a little difficult around there, but that's to be expected."}
{"input": "I've walked past this hotel many times whenever I'm in the city. This hotel is pretty nice. The lobby area is really nice. So many events in this hotel. Quite a few TVs to catch up on the latest scores from different sports."}
{"input": "This place was awesome! It ended up being one of our favorite meals in Nashville - and that is saying a lot!! Our server, Grant, was a rockstar and so helpful and patient with us. Definitely recommend. Great burgers, beer, and staff!"}
{"input": "The restaurant smelled like a toilet.  I couldn't stand it.  My daughter and I got the meals to go and the guy put them in the same box.  She doesn't eat fish and that is what I got.  I know it's a sushi restaurant but she likes the California rolls.  I got the spicy tuna roll.  It was mediocre.  My daughter did enjoyed hers.  Will not be going back."}
{"input": "When you first walk into the hotel, its impressive. Its very modern and looks clean. That kinda changes when you get to your floor. Once the elevator doors opened I knew that the downstairs was a facade. There were stains on the floor everywhere, including a large red one in my room. The room itself was fine but my floor was a nightmare. I was alone and actually scared thanks to a rowdy group of people that kept slamming doors and yelling at each other. Then at 12:15am someone actually started pounding on MY door. I was terrified and not well reseted to catch my 6 am flight."}
{"input": "The Habit Burger is a straight up legit burger place.  It's always been a toss up for me between in n out and habit burger.  I got me a double char and choco shake at the goleta habit and it was as usual, delicious.\n\nThe onion rings are very good also."}
{"input": "This place was great! Love the cozy atmosphere inside this second level restaurant with great people-watching views. The cocktails are tasteful and fun, and their wine selection is good. The food was delightful! We started with the beets and then both ordered the seasonal sweet potato gnocchi,  with a panna cotta to satisfy our sweet tooth for dessert. Overall experience was lovely and our server, Joe, was so welcoming and attentive. Definitely recommend this place to all and will be back again!"}
{"input": "This is just a normal burger joint in Clearwater Beach just a few blocks down from the pier. It's attached to coffee culture so you can get a cup of joe & a burger to go. I had a cheeseburger w/ bacon & chili cheese fries to go. Food was decent. Not bad but not great either. Great place to get fast food if you have the munchies after a few drinks by the pool and don't want to order room service!"}
{"input": "My hubbie likes to think of himself as a pizza connoisseur they serve pizza, he's probably eaten there. We go to Mellow Mushroom about 3x/month and this place has the best pizza in the bay...hands down!\n\nWe enjoy the Maui Wowie...pesto, chicken, bacon, pineapple, and banana peppers. The crust is always cooked to the perfect crunchy texture and there's a great beer selection here. \n\nStaff is always very friendly and have never had to wait for a table."}
{"input": "Craving sushi tonight but wanted to get away from the norm. I remembered Kei Sushi and headed over to that part of town. \nWe walked in to a nice, pleasant atmosphere and were seated quickly. The ambience and decor are great and it's not overly loud. \nOur sushi chef, Isiah, made some nice suggestions right off the bat a they were delicious. The nigiri was very fresh and full of flavor. \nMy favorites of the night were the ceviche appetizer, the pink lady and the albacore. \nWill put on the top of my list for sushi."}
{"input": "So yummy with so many flavors!! We got here 5 minutes before it closed and there was a huge line! We got to stay past 10 thankfully! The toppings are 50 cents extra each!! Kind of rediculous BUT she put on a TON of sprinkles. Soooo that made up for the extra cost.  The ice cream is really good and the whole place smells amazing. I highly recommend!!"}
{"input": "The food is disgusting. We watched the cook microwave all the food. Never go here. I didn't even eat the food"}
{"input": "Definitely recommend the Three Cup Chicken, Cumin Lamb, and Dan Dan Noodles.\n\nGood to eat in or take-out (but unlimited rice if you eat in!)."}
{"input": "The pizza here is unique and very tasty. You get a good amount of toppings for the money and the salads are crisp and cold & good too. Really nice place to take the family."}
{"input": "Visited on a Sunday night, 8:30-11. 9-11 is Yuengling $2 pint drafts and $3 bottles. \n\nWe came in a group, a Yelp after party, if you will. You were wonderfully accommodating, and  I promised I'd mention that server Dan P was especially attentive and accommodating of our crowd.\n\nI think the drinks came perfectly balanced, which is very nice. Sometimes you love when drinks come strong, but they're not necessarily delicious. Here, you get booze, but also scrumptiousness. You treated our group to kamikazes--- thanks, they were great!\n\nAlso, in addition to a plethora of drinks, we got the nachos and the \"awesome fries.\" These were fantastic, like over-the-top perfect for satisfying grease cravings while drinking... DELICIOUS. Even without happy hour specials, this was a great night for service, food, drinks, and the game- thanks for having both soccer and football on screens all over the freaking place. :)"}
{"input": "We recently purchased a used car for my son, it was a 2006 and of course comes with no warranty because of the age, but I expected them to send it home with us in a safe condition. It was supposedly just inspected and had a brand new PA state inspection and oil change sticker from Conicelli. Needless to say we got it home and the next day the front left tire blew . It was completely dry rotted on the backside and the tire shop ended up replacing both front tires for $450. Money is one thing but after seeing how the tire just shredded we could have been killed on I95 on the way home. The tire just entirely fell apart. Never would recommend them now."}
{"input": "Stopped in for some drinks and an app. Got the calamari, it was good. Batter was a bit heavy but the calamari itself was cooked well, not rubbery at all. Asked for more marinara because it only comes with about a tablespoon. Was told we would be charged for more sauce to accompany the 3/4 of our calamari that we had left. I understand not giving the house away for free but give and appropriate side of accompaniments for paying customers."}
{"input": "The Emergency room staff were kind, helpful and very attentive.  Once I was admitted the nursing staff were amazing and the surgeon explained everything to my family in a calm and respectful manner.  I would recommend this hospital and I'm grateful for the excellent care I received."}
{"input": "I went in on a Sunday morning to pick up a few desserts for a family gathering at the Center City location..  I saw Baklava, and was told not to purchase them by the sales associate (and I appreciate her honesty) because they were hard as a rock..  I then purchased to cakes, a Pound cake, and a peanut butter mousse cake.  Everyone was looking forward to the peanut butter cake.  EVERYONE TOOK A BITE AND SPIT IT OUT!  IT WAS STALE.  The chocolate was ok, but the mousse has a horrible RANK taste, and SMELL as well.  It tasted and smelled  like spoiled cream cheese.  It wasn't one of those things that taste like something, IT WAS SPOILED.  Even the partial peanut butter cups on the top tasted stale!!!\n\nThe pound cake was ok, nothing special..  Needless to say, the experience of tasting spoiled food makes me never to return again!"}
{"input": "It has been now 4 occurrences where I am told they have no time for acrylics and there's several workers not busy just sitting around. This place used to me one of my favorites but now they are so rude and \"don't have time\" for anyone! Real bummer"}
{"input": "We stopped by for dinner, the food was great and the service excellent. The Whitman roast beef sandwich is delish! We got an appetizer, two sandwiches and three drinks for less than $30. Highly recommended!"}
{"input": "Ok, this is not a 5 star, but I'm  giving the 5th star due to value for money.  The sectional that seats 4-5 with ottoman makes it comfortable if you want to visit with another couple.  Rooms were nice and spacious except for the tiny bathroom.  We would stay again and recommend to friends. Staff was friendly and helpful.  They had some tasty breakfast sandwich combinations. Tasty, made frequently, so relatively fresh.  Much better than most complementary breakfast options.\n\nEdit:  I left something in room and they are FedEx to me (my cost).  I very much appreciate their quick response."}
{"input": "Beer list is good and the bartender was very knowledgeable and friendly. Food was ok. Wings were small and blah. The burger, which is the yardstick of civilization, was way over cooked. Ordered medium well and was burned."}
{"input": "I was not sure what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised!  I had the fish tacos.  everything tasted fresh and they were very good.  The fries were good and the service was fine. \n\nWe went for lunch and the place was full of golfer's which left only 1 table. A few of us non golfer's and complete stranger's decided just to share a larger table.\n\nIt wasn't such a fantastic place that I would seek it out but if staying at the Omni it is worth a try."}
{"input": "First visit to this new salad & pizza joint. Design your own or select from menu for either or both signature items. Ingredients are very fresh and available in a broad range of choices. I particularly liked the standard thin pizza crust which is made fresh daily on-site. My Greek salad was excellent. Bread sticks are very good. My mother-in-law enjoyed the salad with chicken, cukes, banana peppers and cheese that she created. Service was efficient and workers were knowledgeable and pleasant. I'll be back for an encore experience."}
{"input": "Produce is fresh, local when available, and always tasty. They accept credit cards, which is pretty unique for most local produce markets. I love that is a family-run business and is much cheaper than the old, tasteless produce that is sold at most super-markets. We have also bought vegetables and herbs for our garden here."}
{"input": "Small menu, seems like a neighborhood diner atmosphere. We had the biscuits and gravy and the slinger, which comes with sausage instead of hamburger. Iced coffee is truly just black coffee served over large chunks of ice. Food was good, but nothing was great. Very small dining room with family style communal seating. First time trying, but probably won't be back."}
{"input": "It's hilarious to me how I can walk in one day and not sell anything to one person and three days later can walk in to a totally different person and sell almost everything that I brought in the previous time to that person sometimes \nToday I brought in a brand new items that I bought on sale from LF some of them were worn only one time and some of them still have the tags on them and none of my items were accepted I am so over this place it's like the 5th time I've dumped some pretty expensive clothes into the habitat for humanity bin lately."}
{"input": "Always a great way to spend 'lunch'! I'm not sure when they made upgrades to this location but they look great! Only downside to their upgrades, the shoe department is smaller! HUGE new maternity section, I don't need that...hence my shoe disappointment! The housewares department is great too but it seems to me the prices used to be a little lower. It's not furniture store prices, but there are still reasons an item is at Marshall's! All in all, I love this location and I think today was the first time I was satisfied with just Marshall's and didn't have to go next door to TJ Maxx too!"}
{"input": "Place looks nice but really isn't. The rooms are low quality and small. \n\nOur toilet is the same as a toilet from a Seven Eleven. Our window is cracked as well.\n\nThey charge you to park your car as well. In my opinion when you pay $200+ for a room parking should be free."}
{"input": "Very nice, quiet and dark restaurant. Chinese and sushi offered. Had szechuan chicken, hot and sour soup, and steamed rice. Hubbie had the prime rib and shrimp hot pot. Just the right amount of food. Didn't have to take any home. Service was excellent."}
{"input": "Some of the best sushi I've ever tasted!  Run by a husband & wife team, and they always remember my name when I come in!  \n\nThis is my goto place for Sushi in the Cherry Hill area."}
{"input": "We stopped in for the crab and it did not disappoint.   The service was friendly and prompt.  We would definitely recommend this place as the crab and oyster shooters were great."}
{"input": "I typically go to The Hair Saloon for Men, and this place gave me a much better cut than they ever have for the same price.  Mark took care of me while I was there with a great cut and good conversation.  I plan on going there as long as I'm living downtown."}
{"input": "Great vegetarian and organic menu, friendly and helpful staff and delicious coffee! I'm definitely coming back"}
{"input": "No dark beer in February???  Nice looking place and nice folks...  summer beer in February was a disappointment..."}
{"input": "Every one raves about the oysters for Happy Hour, but check out the Daily Lunch specials.     You get a choice of app or soup and a fixed daily entrée.   Always a good bite at lunch time and you don't always need a reservation."}
{"input": "It was... not good.  We got there late-ish on a Sunday, and the service was such that it was obvious nobody there cared.  Burgers were super dry and overcooked.  Fries were cold and soggy and too greasy, not to mention only half filled.  We've been wanting to try this place since moving here a year ago, and we will not be going back."}
{"input": "Stopped in for takeout and got a half chicken and lomo saltado. The lomo saltado was delicious. My husband saved the white meat chicken for me (it's usually my favorite) and unfortunately, it was inedibly dry. Hubs said the dark meat was amazing though, so hopefully my white meat dryness was a fluke. I would definitely go back for both the chicken and lomo saltado."}
{"input": "Dinner for 9 was just fantastic. We celebrated a 70th birthday and received first class treatment all the way.  Sure it was very expensive but our steaks and entrees were outstanding. Great service, great food and great ambiance."}
{"input": "ML Rose is the bee's knees! Nite owl burger was out of this world and we loved the bottle caps (fried pickles). Service was great, cant wait to go back"}
{"input": "My first visit today; I was craving a craft burger (6 months pregnant-these cravings must be obeyed) so read a ton of reviews of places right around my work and finally gave ML Rose a chance. The Nashvegas did not disappoint! My medium rare was tender, juicy and the pimento, while it wasn't like any pimento I've ever had (more cheddar than pimento) was abundant and went great with the fried onions and tangy barbeque sauce. Pretty messy, but that's always a good indicator for me of a great tasting burger! Enjoyed the sweet potato fries too. Got it take out and it was ready pretty quickly. Nice cozy cool looking joint...will likely be back after pregnancy to pair another burger with their beer selection :-)"}
{"input": "Oh my goodness if you ever want to start on a health \"trip\" this is the place to start. They have so many different vitamins (hence the name), healthy dietary supplements, beauty products and homeopathic items as well. The staff was super helpful in assisting me find some of the items i needed to make my very own moisturizer. They helped me locate the items they had and provided suggestions for items they did not have. They also have a rewards program for frequent shoppers - LOVE THAT! And they accept digital coupons- LOVE THAT TOO!"}
{"input": "The best ten dollar lunch in America, hands down. Banchan city, crack that egg into your volcano like five pepper pork soft tofu and go crazy. The parking lot scares me, but the place is the best. Go there. Staff not so much miserable as maybe not fluent? I dunno, I always figure it's because I'm a round eye."}
{"input": "Thank you for great bottle service for bday and Halloween party and special gift!!! Always have a great bartenders and cocktail servers!!! Thank you for Brennan and Johnny!!!!!! :D"}
{"input": "Good Greek food.  Best gyro I've had in Florida.  Good Greek salad, but it only had two olives and one slice of pepper.  The rice, saganaki, and spanikopita were excellent, but the green beans were canned.  Overall, worth going to."}
{"input": "Couldn't ask for better off of bourbon street. We were waited on by the owner and she was wonderful. She explained the history of the drinks names and about the band. The drinks are petite but pack a huge punch( &10 a drink). We sat and listened to the four person jazz band and watched a football game. A perfect spot, I can't say enough good things about it."}
{"input": "One my fav places to eat, fast service and friendly waiters/waitresses. The general rule of thumb in New Orleans metro is don't eat chain food restaurants but this is THE exception.   You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  I love the cowboy burger, but my favorite is to share the seafood platter with my wife and child.  I one thing they don't have is soft shell crab.  Don't worry about dessert, you can have all the soft serve ice cream you want.   The fry is seasoned just right the potato wedges are heavenly done.  Probably not good for my body but GOOOOD for my Soul!  If you can't find something you like there's a problem."}
{"input": "This place is unique to say the least. The first time we went, we had reservations and still waited 2 hours to be seated. The manager refused to make anyone leave the place, even patrons who had been there 4 or more hours. \n\nNeedless to say, whatever they lacked in the seating they made up in the excellent food. \n\nThe seven courses are amazing, although i prefer the chicken over the honey lamb. the chicken has a kick to it and is so soft it keeps tearing. I have never has Morocan food more delicious than this. \n\nOne bad thing is that it is cash only... which sucks but like i said the food is so great its worth it."}
{"input": "What a great place to find exactly what you need at any price.  Sadly, there are so few places left like this; a great small business with caring, helpful staff.  I went in looking for a gift for someone special for a big birthday, but not sure WHAT I wanted. Becky helped me, patiently, pick out the perfect gift at a lower price than I expected to pay.  Looking forward to getting back there for something for myself!"}
{"input": "Wings (parmesan garlic) were awesome as they  usually are, but the older blonde bartender with glasses was in the weeds. This place has been much better recently, but it seems like they have trouble finding good help. Hoping they change up the menu or specials a little more then they have been. Creativity in the kitchen might be a good thing."}
{"input": "This was a gem of a find.  The biscuit and sausage gravy were too die for. It's a tight spot and a little loud but you won't care because the food is sooo good."}
{"input": "Amazing pralines! Lots of interesting candy products and very friendly staff. Loved it!"}
{"input": "Ordered pizza and tipped a buck. Made wrong pizza...waited...made another wrong pizza...girl talked to manager and walked into back room with pizza and suddenly came out with the right sauce and already had cheese already on it. Don't know what happened in the back room but I thought they were supposed to make it in front of you. Then they treated me like I was the asshole."}
{"input": "Surprisingly good, bit expensive though. California Roll was mediocre however the Spicy Tuna Roll, Crunch Roll, Shrimp and Hamachi were pretty good."}
{"input": "The 'fries' were soggy and tasteless, mostly the potato ends.  Not pleasant at all.  The chicken sandwich was a greasy piece of thin chicken between to pieces of grease soaked bun... that's it.  The only thing good was the lemonade.  We won't need to go back.  The make KFC look good!"}
{"input": "California burrito but I get it *deep fried w/ sour cream & guacamole along w/ my carrot bag and a side of ranch. Love that they put so much meat in that shit! Love me my California burrito!"}
{"input": "I don't give five star ratings very easily but my wife and I just had a fantastic experience. Debbie was our waitress and she was simply exceptional. Explained the menu and specials as well as answering all my questions. Food was very good, came out fast and hot. Prepared exactly how it was ordered. Will be back. \nMac n cheese burger was dope fiend!  \nDrinks were spot on as well. Whisky sour was great."}
{"input": "I typically love KFC but my opinion is changing based on increasing cost and poor service.\n\nWas interested in trying their new Nashville flavor but was advised that it is only offered in strips, as a 2 piece with one side or a bucket. I wanted it in a 3 piece with two sides and was advised that that was not possible. I guess I won't be able to try it."}
{"input": "It was a quiet Tuesday night. Food was great.  I really enjoyed the cavatelli w/ sausage.  I can't wait to return and sample the variety of risotto. I have a new favorite place."}
{"input": "Worst pharmacy ever!!! I had to transfer a medication to a pharmacy that was closer to me, but do you think anyone can get a hold of anyone on the phone? The pharmacy tried for days and I tried for a long time and nothing!!!\n\nWorst customer service ever!"}
{"input": "This is the McDonalds closest to my home, but I will forever drive any distance to find another bc it's a terrible restaurant. Even though it's not politically correct to say \"I love McDonalds\", every now and again and during lent we go to McDonalds and this one is really bad. Bad food, always cold or wrong items.  Bad service, and no offense to anyone but I cannot even communicate with most employees bc they don't speak any ENGLISH!!  I do not know much Spanish either but when I'm trying to spend my money in Fishers Indiana at a business I at least expect to be able to communicate in some way!  Their service is the slowest from any McDonalds in this area!  My advice: pass on this location unless you have allot of time and can speak Spanish !!!!"}
{"input": "Few years ago this used to be the best. Wasnt that price they had a ton of stuff staff always helpful and friendly. I bough a part once it was faulty returned it they gave me my money back no question about it. Another time I bough a part I didnt need returned that too money in hand no question. Starting to go down now but still pretty decent place"}
{"input": "It's old school food where the locals eat...That's always a good sign plus it's been open forever so I am pretty sure that means they are doing something right. Make sure you are hungry when you come here because they aint scared to fill the plate with plenty of food. Had the seafood plater and WOW they piled on the fried goods!!! The service is quick and prices are very reasonable. Will go back when I am in town again. Remember it's not diet food."}
{"input": "Wow!! Awesome place. This is my first yelp review because this place is so great. Being Hispanic I am really impressed with the quality and authenticity of the food at Lima Fusion. \n\n\nI would definitely return to eat here again."}
{"input": "This is a decent pizza place with a pizza bar around the pizza oven/hearth where you can see them make pizza right in front of you. \nThe service is pretty quick. The only downside is that it is a small place and is always crowded so you should expect wait times."}
{"input": "WOW, a great meal. We had the nachos, chicken and waffles, and the mushroom ramen. I was blown away. Sadly we live 40 mins away but the menu and the staff were great! We are for sure going to go back again. Flavors were greatly complex and their wide use of mushrooms shows they know what they were doing. \nCant wait until next time."}
{"input": "The food is disgusting, no beef in fried rice, egg foo young gravy clumpy and nasty. Even the crabless Rangoon are way too sweet, they are not as good as some of the other local spots( China Dish) What cemented the one star was the rude employees that you have to deal with when asking for basic requests i.e. bean sprouts. When they don't have them and you sub extra white rice and they just open box and through them in on top. What a joke!"}
{"input": "I'm not sure what happened to their Kung Pao chicken, but it is horrifying. You spend more time picking out the tiny bones than ever have the time to actually enjoy the meal. The sauce is good and the chicken is crispy - \"Yeah, that's good enough. No need to listen to any more.\" Uh, no. They chop the chicken into extremely small bits (with the bones inside - so now you're getting bone shards). I've injured my mouth several times. \n\nIn the end, it makes the experience frustrating, annoying, and extremely discouraging to try anymore of their food. Please get your shit together."}
{"input": "I have purchased tires from Tires Plus in Flourtown at least 4 times. On this visit they mounted 4 new Michelins that I supplied. My car was worked on as soon as I arrived for the scheduled appointment at 9:00 and was returned to me within one hour."}

{"input": "The first time I ordered from this location, my order included a 2-liter of diet coke, but I received two 16-oz diet cokes instead. The second time I ordered from this location, my pizza came pushed to one side of the box as if it had slipped, or been dropped. I have NEVER experienced this much poor service from a Domino's before. I love Domino's, but no longer trust this location to deliver me a quality product."}

{"input": "After reading positive reviews, we decided to try it .  We loved the food!  Great flavors.  I had the seafood tacos which were better than any I have tried in the Reno area.  Husband had chile verde... loved it.  Small location with very personable staff.  We will return even tho it is a drive from south Reno. :-)"}
{"input": "Han dynasty is amazing as advertised. A bunch of my friends always brag about it and I had to go there. The dan dan noodles are amazing. They're so addictive that I've been craving them since I left the building. Definitely going to make it a regular place to go to on my list"}
{"input": "Gorgeous old building that used to be an 1800s commodities exchange but is repurposed to house souvenir shops and some food court type eateries.  Although the stores are cheesy, it can be a great rest stop and the inside is still stunning."}
{"input": "Excellent place for a quick and casual breakfast. Delicious French toast. There are a lot of options on the menu. We also enjoyed the generous potion of fruit. Highly recommend if you have kids."}
{"input": "The Loew's hotel is very clean and looks very nice. The service is amazing. My family and I wanted to stay for a whole month. The breakfast there is fantastic! My son said it looked like it was the future. That's how nice it was! The rooms were nice size and the parking is convenient. That's why I give the Loew's hotel 5 stars."}
{"input": "If your tired of Hooters and want a little more than good chicken wings. Welcome to Brick House Tavern (Man Cave) The food as well as the service is really good. And if you like beer the have the towers. All in all this a great place to sit back, have some good food and watch the game. Hard to recommend a dish when everything I've had has been pretty good. Enjoy!!!!!"}
{"input": "Great pasta and pizza.  The yelp reviews are right on the mark.  I enjoyed a very nice bolognese along with a simple pizza.  Both met my expectations.  The atmosphere was pleasant but not fancy or sexy.  This is a good way to spend a Tuesday - Thursday night but you may want to step it up a bit on Friday or Saturday.   Cheers."}
{"input": "After numerous visits here, we really wanted to like this place but each time there has been a number of issues, many repeating. No matter the time of day, it seems to get pretty rowdy and my friends and I have had drinks spilled on us on multiple occasions. Almost every time I have been here with my fiancé or friends, it has taken an abnormally long time to get service whether it be inside, outside at a table or bar. The food is mediocre for the price and a few times the food took MUCH longer to come out than what we were told, and when asking management what was going on, we were told that the estimate was wrong and it was \"too bad\". Staff is rude and far from attentive, though it seems like this place is always over-staffed when we have been here. Amazes me that management allows such a huge lack in customer service. No longer wasting our time and money here, and we advise our friends and family to do the same. It is too much of a hit-and-miss to come here and attempt to have a good time."}
{"input": "Great pizza! The place is beautiful and the atmosphere is truly inviting. The service is very nice and fast."}
{"input": "Just moved to the area and was really excited to try a new restaurant. Masami did not disappoint! The hibachi was delicious! I always use a basic sushi roll as a measuring stick to decide whether or not the sushi is fresh/good and the Philadelphia roll was 2 thumbs up!\n\nI would've rated my experience a 5..but I felt like the hibachi chef could've been better. He had a dull personality compared to most.\n\nI will definitely be back!"}
{"input": "Excellent food! I am a Thai food junkie, and have travelled to Thailand and throughout Southeast Asia several times. There is ok Thai food in Nashville and then there is Great Thai food. This place was GREAT! The decor is a little dated but who cares...I was there for the food, which is fabulous!!!"}
{"input": "Even half priced feels overpriced when the service is so poor you cant get water when you literally flag down a woman holding a full water pitcher to return to the kitchen and then you have to add a tip on top of it. mediocre sushi from the one I got and I didn't hear any raving down the table of choices. You will smell unpleasantly deep fried coming away from this place. \n\nOverall, way too many better options to want eat here again."}
{"input": "Almost everything that should be written about Sabino Canyon, has been written in these reviews. Sabino is a very special place. if you can manage it, take time to walk around after stopping in the visitor center. You see most everything that will teach you about the desert within a mile of the visitor center. If you can get off on a trail, so much the better! \n\nI see that many people recommend the tram. I don't. The cost is high for what you get, now $10 per person. The comments from the drivers are seldom insightful. And, worst, the trams are loud and dirty, spewing pollutants. The Forest Service has shown no leadership in getting the company to convert to clean fuels. The company shows no interest in doing so. As a result, they degrade what they purport to show off. I would suggest the tram only if you are truly unable to walk."}
{"input": "What's the point of setting a pick up time for a ToGo order when you end up waiting 30mins after that to get your food anyway?? The restaurant wasn't busy in the slightest, and it literally took over 30 minutes from the time I was supposed to pick up my order for them to actually bring out my to go order. I could've walked in and ordered food, and I would've gotten it faster."}
{"input": "This hotel is located near the Tampa International airport.  I stayed here last week and have stayed here several times over the past 8 years.  This Embassy Suites is not like most Embassy Suites as it does not have the center atrium.  The hotel is a standard high rise building.  \n\nBad - Parking at this hotel is a challenge.  They have a small garage and the parking spots are very small with extremely tight turns.  If you want to prevent getting your doors dinged, don't park in the garage.  Also, there is no elevator in the multi-story parking garage.  So plan on dragging your luggage up and down several flights of stairs. \n\nGood - As with all Embassy Suites they put out a good breakfast spread with cooked-to-order eggs, omelettes and pancakes.  Also, the employees at this hotel are very friendly.\n\nIn summary, I find the parking situation to be unacceptable and I will choose a different hotel when returning to Tampa."}
{"input": "Whole family got sick after eating here. The frozen yogurt was pretty but did not taste good. Would not go here again or recommend it."}

I'd complain about the inaudible Spanish fellow working the drive through but why would I expect much else..\n\nUpdate:  they just charged me .25 cents for ranch..  I'm pretty wealthy actually but this stuff is so annoying.  I handed him a dollar, took 4 of them and walked to the trash can to throw away 3 of them as I only needed one.  I feel I made my point.."}
{"input": "I LOVE this place!  I've been going to this park for over twenty years before moving to MD and it is the one place I miss more than anything else in PA.  I love trail running the best, especially the Indian statue side.  I used to go here almost everyday and I hope someday I move back."}
{"input": "Great job first day open packed but well organized me and my family will be back multiple times a week. Thanks for coming to reno."}
{"input": "After spending the night at a friend's place in NoLibs, I was in search of a place to grab breakfast and coffee, so I gave Red Cup Café a shot.  I settled on a coffee and an egg and cheese sandwich on an English muffin.  The café definitely lives up to its name in that hot beverages are served in red mugs, and the atmosphere is homey and low-key, just like the corner coffee shops we all know and love.  Much to my delight, as I was enjoying my breakfast (which was well prepared, by the way), the very friendly owner (?) Rick made conversation with me and we chatted for a good while, since it seemed to be pretty slow for a Monday morning.  Will definitely be back next time I am in the neighborhood!"}
{"input": "Meh... this is a suburban bar parked on a city block.  In a lot of suburban bars, people are looking for one thing: a place that serves alcohol.  If you can do that, you have a successful business model.  One thing I prefer about bars in the city is that most need to do more to retain their clientele, which leads to a better bar experience for the patrons.  I think bars are better when personalized, you can find something that is exactly what you are looking for, rather than the same music played incredibly loud at a place without anyone dancing or seemingly listening to the music with the same drinks, the same... everything.\n\nThis is a lowest common denominator bar designed with one purpose in mind: get as many people to come in as possible.   This results in a lack of personality and soul for the bar.  There isn't really anything special about it."}
{"input": "When I visited downtown Santa Barbara, I enjoyed the original location so much that I decided to stop by the second location later that evening.\n\nThis location is far more spacious and still preserves the whimsy and artsy atmosphere I liked in the first location. I ordered the Magic Bowl and it was absolutely amazing. The baristas were also very courteous.\n\nI think this spot is more ideal for doing work or studying on a nice afternoon. Just a few blocks away from State St., it is a bit quieter and less crowded. It's a bit strange that the two locations would be so close to one another, but my guess is that they cater to slightly different crowds (studiers vs. shoppers), so I'll take it."}
{"input": "in out, in out every busy place has its methods just indicate on the board which seating your pref is.  sounds like fast food or my first coitus experience.  sure its the pier 39, long wharf, alaskan way of SB, but a tourist has got to eat\n\nbisque and lobster tacos? o miss molly, good golly\n\nbetween the wait, good company, fresh food and postcard views i forgot if the service was any good.  it wasnt bad but then again you coulda punched me in the face as i was enjoyin myself that much"}
{"input": "I went to the office at Pima and wilmot. Everyone was great. Probably the best medical experience ever. Thanks guys"}
{"input": "Great food in a great location. Locals recommended this place to me - and I see why. Great authentic Louisiana food on Frenchmen St, a street filled with great music clubs. The best of both worlds. The gumbo Zaire so rich and flavorful and my wife loved their regular gumbo. Their Jambalaya was delicious and the bread pudding is my new standard. One of the best meals I experienced in New Orleans."}
{"input": "Only game in town.  I occasionally like to go here because they have fabulous crab cakes.  However, three stars because the service was so god awful.  We were there on a Tuesday night & the restaurant was not crowded.  It took 1hour and 15 minutes to receive our entrees.  No joke.  Of those entrees, two were kids' meals and one was a cheeseburger.  The food was fine...but really 45 minutes to wait for a salad?  We were told that the delay was b/c we ordered wings first and there was a table of 10 in the other room.  OK...It wasn't until i suggested that they bring the kids' meals after 45 minutes that the waitress even figured out something might be wrong.  Save your money...stay home for Kraft mac n cheese next time."}
{"input": "Great place, I had a moment to swing in as I walked from M.O.B.S Barbershop while I was taking a straight razor class from Franco.\n I was in a hurry to catch the boat at the wharf for a sunset sail,  so I didn't get to stay long.  I will return to just vacation next time. Great atmosphere and the friendliest people.  Really wanted to stay for the music!!! Love it!"}
{"input": "The service here is pretty fast, seemingly even on at prime dinner time of 8pm. The portions for the main course that I got seemed small - but if you get an appetizer either to share or on your own, an average person should be in good shape. \n\nFor the table we got an order of the Truffle Rosemary Parmesan French Fries, which were very flavorful. It had a nice earthy truffle taste, balanced with the saltiness of the Parmesan, and rounded out with the rosemary. \n\nMain course was the Bacon Wrapped shrimp with Stone ground Grits. This was exceptional - and was probably the best 'shrimp n' grits' i've had in NOLA. Shrimp was perfectly cooked, with a crisp piece of bacon wrapped around it. It stayed crispy even on top of the moist, decadent, and flavorful cheese grits."}
{"input": "What a gem!  Friendly, attentive staff.  Family-owned.  Tasty, homemade items.  Real crab in the crab and cream cheese wontons.  They offer beef gyoza, along with chicken and pork, which were delicious.   Popular with locals, too."}
{"input": "I knew I was going to get a haircut by a student but for some reason I thought maybe she would have gotten some training first. My 2 hour hair cut was the worst of my life. I told this girl I wanted my hair cut back to my shoulders. Well, somehow in the time it took to wash my hair and take out her scissors somehow this \"trained\" genius forgot I have curly hair. My hair ended up at my ears and looked like a poodle. I love the products but I will never get another hair cut there again."}
{"input": "i wish i could have given it a zero or a negative.  my first and last experience was not pleasant at all. i ordered the tabbouleh and hummus platter when it came imagine my surprise to find the tabbouleh was about 96% parsley.  i kept looking for the bulgur wheat and there was literally none to speak of.  when i brought this to the attention of the staff i was blown off and treated as if i did not know what i was talking about.  i then asked for a to go and forgot it when i left.  i came back in under three minutes and it had been tossed already.  the next time i want mediterranean food i will support a local mediterranean restaurant that is owned and operated by mediterraneans.  this is poorly prepared fast food in a semi pretty package."}
{"input": "amazing hidden gem...have the burger, it's amaze! Dustin is thee most attentive server. This is a must stop, old charming bldg with fantastic food!"}
{"input": "I love poke bowls. I became obsessed in Cali. So much delicious fish at such good price. So much cheaper than sashimi. So when this place opened, I showed up on the first day. I couldn't wait but unfortunately I was let down. \n1. They were really friendly\n2. I got the biggest bowl ($11.95) and I was highly disappointed at how small it was!! Also they gave me very little fish. \n3. When we got to the veggies, the owner told me I could pick whichever and how many I wanted. So obviously I picked one of each. \n4. When paying, somehow my order went from 11.95 to $19 something !!  They had charged me\nFor some of the extra veggies, but he never told me about that or else I wouldn't have picked one of each. \nOverall, I will give it a try in a few months once they are more established bc I want so bad to have a poke bowl place in the city. There will be another poke bowl restaurant opening soon in Chinatown, so hope that one is better than this one."}
{"input": "Service was good. Mesquite wings are very good  best to share or save some don't be greedy like me and try.and go back to work. Only downside was the weak lemonade. It was the weakest I ever had."}
{"input": "Of course we are from out of town. Drove by it alot so we stopped and tryed it, the food was great the atmosphere was great.. We had the rudest waitress i have ever encounter she did not say hi she never smiled it was like we were bothering her to be there.... i wish we would of had another waitress we probably would have stayed longer, i suggested to the people i was with after we paid our tab to her to go to the bar and they said no lets just get outta here...its amazing how one person can make you feel this way.."}

{"input": "Hilton properties are some of the oldest,  most dilapidated properties in the hotel business.  Additionally,  the customer service is the very worst overall with a few exceptions. \nMade a reservation here for 1 bedroom suite.  Suite wasn't ready.  Had a 12:30 lunch mtg  Needed to shower and change but suite booked wasn't ready.  What I thought was a courtesy extend turned out to be bait a D switch.  They gave e me a 'courtesy room' with the understanding that upon my return,  I would get the suite I booked. \nI  returned just to be to told that 'the room I booked had been sold.' Really,???? \nThe suite was $250. The downside graded room was $235. I couldn't cancel the room and all of the rooms at a lower rate were 'sold out'  How is that possible so quickly? \nFake apologies we're given,  but no satisfaction when more could have been done.   Never again."}

{"input": "An easy walk from Quality Beach Resorts. We sat upstairs on the deck. The service was quick and polite. We shared calamari as an appetizer and enjoyed our drinks."}
{"input": "I went here to get my wisdom teeth out and they did a great job. The only complaint I have is that I never see the same dentist. I've been going here for 5 years."}
{"input": "Be wary of the prices they tell you because there is an 18% \"service charge\" plus 6% sales tax added onto the total bill.  Just add 24% to the number they tell you."}
{"input": "Expected better with all the hype. Tastes like bland day old pizza with a rubber crust. And I watched them make it. Perhaps this \"under new management\" thing has something to do with it?"}
{"input": "Super delish!! No frills! Just great sea food, sour dough bread was great! And I loved the 80s music playing!!"}
{"input": "Renata has a heart made of gold. I was very satisfied with the level of service provided by her and her staff."}
{"input": "The worst service I've had at a restaurant in years. Went on a Sunday for lunch and our waitress took forever at every step in the process, and acted like she was doing us a favor at all times. Never smiled or treated us with basic human dignity. The final straw was when she finally brought our food, I was left to stare at it while it got cold for almost 10 minutes because she didn't bring any silverware. I had to ask three different waitstaff for silverware before I finally got it. And all of this for pretty mediocre, way overpriced food. Nashville has SO MANY good restaurants (particularly burger places) that there's no reason to eat here."}
{"input": "Super--fabulous! I chose to patronize this store during my trip to New Orleans simply based on the yelp feedback. I was not disappointed! Fabulous! This liquor store was more charming and delivered better service to me than the Omni Hotel. The owner and his seasoned staff (24 plus years of loyal employees) were so gracious, plus THEY DELIVERED to my hotel.  Ignore the \"outdated and dirty\" comments from others, this place is quaint. THE BEST, I mean the best bloody Mary you can get for cheap folks!  Delicious, with plenty of garnish. I say they were better and more affordable than the bloody Marys at Pat O'Briens!!  I cannot wait for my next trip to Nawlins and I will be back to this joint--no doubt!"}
{"input": "The beers are great and delivered quickly. The food is OK and took way too long to be delivered. The waitress was very attentive. The background music was loud and then when the band started to play we could not even talk to each other anymore."}
{"input": "This studio is definitely one of the nicest in town. It is probably more on par with NYC or LA in that regard. Always clean and the most updated equipment. I have only had good instructors for every class, I've tried barre, megaformer and spin. Every single class has been hard as hell and left me sore for days. They lose one star for the really high price point (although I appreciate that they now participate in Classpass which helps) and the inconvenience of the parking situation."}
{"input": "Dawn Webb is more than an asset to Lecada, she is the reason I continue to visit. I have always had a great experience with any and all treatments. They offer most anything and will take the time to sit and explain everything to you. \n\nShe extended her information for any questions or concerns that I had. Thankfully I never had to contact her but the reassurance if I needed it, was there."}
{"input": "The food is great, the service is fantastic, and everything is composts me or recyclable! The prices can be just a bit steep which is why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. I felt $21 for a burger, fries, and a milkshake was too much but it was forgone toy some of the yummiest vegan food I have ever had. Seating is limited at this restaurant as it's mostly a takeaway spot. Plan to most likely get your food to go."}
{"input": "Had breakfast with the family after a quick stopover. Great food and service (thanks Jonathan!), definaelty a good find that was busy but had no wait on a Saturday."}
{"input": "Cute place to eat at. Ate breakfast here and was dissappointed after seeing such good reviews. Breakfast menu is very limited. The omlet was just OK.  Biscuit didnt have much flavor to it. We were able to be seated really quick (during the week) but i imagine it getting really crowded during the weekends."}
{"input": "Good location. Good food. Nice people working there. Subs are comparable to other sub shops and are actually quite tasty. If you stay there and watch them make your sammie, they can't mess up. But I do say just watch, because several times they have forgotten something here and there that I have added to my order. Or, I hate mayo, sometimes they just really badly want to put it on no matter that you've subbed for Ranch instead. \n\nIf you order online and expect campus delivery, be prepared to wait. Sometimes, up to over an hour. While I get they are busy, it is not speedy like other places. Sides are sometimes free with a meal, sometimes there's a fee --I don't understand that drama."}
{"input": "Overpriced and underwhelming.  Had the sausage/egg:cheese sandwich this morning on whole grain $4.89. Sausage was cold and the sandwich was about 1/2 the size of the picture on the menu. It comes on these large plates and it's just a embarrassing.  Husband had bacon/egg/cheese on brioche, $4.89 and his egg was cold and the entire sandwich was greasy.   I can get this kind of food at McDonalds for a fraction of the price."}
{"input": "Eh, crust was dry and we got the Delmar which instead of pizza sauce they use bbq sauce however they barely put any on the pizza which caused it to be dry. The server was good. The pizza took forrrevvverrr to come out though we had been done with our salads for 20-30 minutes."}
{"input": "My roommate and I began our best brunch search months ago and stumbled into Refuel when we first started. After going back a couple of times since, I can say the food is good and the ambiance is great but whole package isn't my top brunch spot in the city, or even in my top 5 (granted, there are a lot of brunch places in New Orleans). \n\nI heard great things about their french toast so I went in with high hopes and was told they no longer serve it!! So, if you're in a sweet mood, get the Belgian waffle with all the goods on the side at no extra cost and share it with a trusted diner. \n\nI'd be happy to return to check out their new menu, so hopefully that will up my brunch scale rating!"}
{"input": "This McDonald's is as terrible as they come. They have no care, mess up every order, take at least 10mins to answer you in drive thru at slow points in the day. Stay away smdh!"}
{"input": "This has been a favorite of the family for as long as it has been open. Good food at a good price. Staff is always great and experience is always great. A solid, very reliable restaurant that never disappoints."}
{"input": "Not health food, but they make their white pizza with enough garlic to burn off any impurties in your soul. You're already off your game if you've walked in there looking for healthy stuff anyway. Settle for fresh and be happy. Delish. \nThey're super nice in there. \nDid I mention the chicken cheese steak? oh yes, its good, and they use fresh, not canned mushrooms. This is important. \nNice vantage point of the passersby on the outside patio, or inside bar. Easy to eat there solo, or outside with a crown in nicer weather. yum."}

{"input": "Miss this little gem more than we could have ever imagined!! While living in Carp we frequented Siam almost every week. The owners are absolutely wonderful and you can't beat the setting. The food is freaking amazing and I've never had a pad thai dish that I've liked better. Definitely try the coconut, mango, sticky rice, it's like heaven!"}
{"input": "I'm all about this bookstore. I wish I had more money to spend there! Whenever I need a book I usually go here. I love the atmosphere and the staff is great to chat with. I can't recall his name but the owner there helped me find a book that I was tracking down for years, he gave me a few web addresses and I finally found it!"}
{"input": "We sat on the patio on one of the most beautiful early evenings Florida has to offer.  Our waiter was very friendly, funny and knowledgable.  We shared a salad with beets, arugula and chevre with pine nuts and a balalmic dressing, wonderful!!  We followed that with the Grouper sandwich that was so fresh and tasty that it is second on my list of favorite Grouper sandwiches I have ever had.  Our waiter said that it was red grouper that had been swimming in the gulf only days ago.  I love the feel of this area in downtown St. Pete and it is a fun place to people watch and enjoy the scenery."}
{"input": "Excellent food and service. The place is functional and funky at the same time. Great choices for breakfast and lunch and a welcoming environment and staff."}
{"input": "My husband and I were staying nearby and stopped here for dinner-to-go one night.  It was fabulous!  Everything we ordered turn out great.  It looks like a dive from the outside, but it's great and the service was also impeccable."}
{"input": "When I think about the time I spent waiting for the server to arrive, for a drinkable cup of coffee to replace the one that tasted like it has been brewed with a goat's hoof, and to digest the hard lump of cheese and egg that was my breakfast, I really wish I had chosen instead to stand in the line-up at Sugarbowl."}
{"input": "Granted they got me my prism film for my glasses, and I went through a different optometrist for the frame. I brought my glasses in. The woman assisting me had me put the film on to measure it. Got that cleared up. Then she comes back 10 minutes later to tell me all done and it will be $35. Not bad price... but when she cut it she didn't bother to tell me she didn't cut them to actually fit my whole frame. \n\nI showed her how she cut them incorrectly, and they look shattered on the sides bc of her cut job. Please do not make me pay for something and have it look like I can't afford a proper lense bc you felt like not doing your job properly. \nI would give it one more star bc they have a good glasses selection"}

{"input": "The entrées and sides in the buffet are nothing special... but the dessert options are better than many restaurants of its kind. Instead of the usual one or two dessert options, they have four--kheer, ras malai, gulab jamun, and jalebi. The jalebi is so delicious; I can only eat a few tiny pieces though, because it is so sweet! If you have a super sweet tooth and love Indian desserts, being content with the pretty average main meal options is worth it to enjoy the sweet highlights."}
{"input": "Food tastes ok! However,given the price, they give you stingy amount of meat.  Despite the owner/waitress' friendly service, I still left feeling ripped off."}

{"input": "The Tuck Special. So good I would drive all the way back out to Nashville from TX just to have it again. It's a mix of strange ingredients- brisket, egg, pimento cheese but combined they are an amazing flavor combination. My husband didn't care for the BBQ sauce on the table, but meat was pretty good. I can see how this place gets crowded, but if you have patience and look up the menu ahead of time, it should be manageable."}

{"input": "Great place with reasonably priced happy hour drinks. I highly recommend the Tuscan Kale salad with black garlic ranch, apples, cheese, and crispy chick-peas."}
{"input": "Have always loved their spaghetti with meat sauce. It always tastes homemade no matter which restaurant I go to in the chain. Also the creamy pesto said dressing is really good on the side salad which is included with the meal. Lunch portions are a good size and I left full. Our waitress was extremely nice. Parking can be an issue on busy days."}

{"input": "Stopped in for the first time with my Friday morning breakfast club wait a little long for a table our waitress seemed to be a little overwhelmed and frazzled we finely got another women to seat us. At that point I knew we were in for a long meal, again we had to get someone's attention to refill coffee cups while waiting for our waitress to take our order Surprisingly our order came out quickly except for one order of French toast which didn't come out until three of us were half way finished with our meal which included a missing order of rye toast.\nThe food was okay nothing to get real excited about except the portion was more then anyone could finish, prices were about average with other breakfast restaurants but got a little more for your money. I'm not going to give it a thumbs down and will let you decide for yourself, maybe we just came at a bad time."}
{"input": "Took my son & bunch of his friends here. Great sandwiches, fun atmosphere, & the quarter retro video games were a hit. \nFor a Deli it deserves 5's."}
{"input": "El Rio is my favorite Tucson municipality golf course.\n\nThe course is tight and challenging. The staff and starters particularly Rudy and Wendall always make me feel like I'm starting or ending at my local country club.\n\nRudy is nothing short of a golf course professional. \n\nThe course isn't long but always seems to challenge me!"}
{"input": "We had our rehearsal dinner here with 33 people. Up until the night of, I had great communication with Athena - She was super helpful, accommodating & quick to reply. Unfortunately, the night of quickly turned into a mess. They had 1 waitress for all 33 people, she was MIA for long periods of time, & told my mom she was bogged down with other tables & patrons. 2 people waited an hour & a half for their first drink & when I told the waitress that, she sat stone-faced like she had no idea what to do or say. (We had opened a tab for our guests so all orders needed to be handled by the waitress). I'm assuming she ended up asking for help because a more pleasant girl came up to take orders, bring food, refill water pitchers, etc towards the end of the night. In short, they did not staff for the event & it quickly became stressful & disappointing. The food that did come out was good & enjoyed by most, but I could never in good faith recommend this place for an event."}
{"input": "We went with the simple choice and were not disappointed. Eggs, bacon and buttermilk pancakes. I can't put my finger on exactly what it was that made them so good, but the pancakes were divine! Worth it in our opinion! Even saw a girl from the voice while dining here!"}
{"input": "Great service and people here! Got my nails done here for the first time and had a great first impression. Would go again for sure."}
{"input": "The girly loves this cemetery for photographing angels and such. Personally, I think she's a little creepy.\n\nOn the plus side, it's quiet, no zombies and the witches doing spells took time out to photobomb a bit.\n\nSo there's that.\n\nSeriously, a well laid out cemetery and some of the better made stones and angels.\n\nAnd no zombies. Remember that part."}
{"input": "Unbelievable great burgers. Liquid sunshine...yum. Budlight $3 @ happy hour.  Hidden gem we stumbled on thanks to yelp. Definitely will return during our 9 day Nashville drinking tour. Wonderful attentive service."}
{"input": "This place is where the former Pollo Loco used to be next to the launder-mat. I'm always in search of the best breakfast burrito and this place has it. Delicious homemade flour tortillas made daily along with a fresh salsa bar with 4 different salsas to choose from. They offer daily specials too! I'll definitely be back for lunch & dinner."}
{"input": "My husband and I live 3 blocks away from Ichiban.  2 years back I gave an unfavorable review for \"bleachy\" smelling t-cups and earthy tasting imago.  As of today, they get my nod of approval!  Hurray! We had a great dinner! We had the Cliff Drive Roll:  wonder mix of heat, great flavor and lovely presentation! Fantastic cucumber salad, plus excellent  chicken ton katsu.  \nGreen Tea...as it should be.  Keep up the great food Ichiban!"}
{"input": "No credit cards =  no good for business. Good local South Philly fare though. Service is adequate as is atmosphere. recommend Victor Cafe much, much more."}
{"input": "Save your money go to El Rodeo across the street.  I love mexican food, I was eager to try this place.   It gets 2 start because the food was fast, edible and hot.  Charged for sour cream..seriously?  It's like going to Logan's and getting charged for steak sauce.  Rice or beans on items instead both with meal.  Charge for more chips and salsa...most have unlimted.  Menu does not describe items unknown to others.  Flavor of the beef was bland, no seasoning.   Taco bell has better flavor and no charge for sour cream.  I saw a staff member adjust his crotch.  Manager had old stained food clothes.  Table was dirty like they only cleaned what was seen...makes me wonder."}
{"input": "Yesterday was my first visit to Paris Parker. I have never gone to a stylist that didn't come with a recommendation in my life until now. I was short on time and wanted to go somewhere near my home.\n\nThey told me I would see Stacey for my full highlight appointment. \n\nShe was awesome!\n\nShe got all the brassy color out of my hair and made my blonde look natural and vibrant. \n\nBlonde hair isn't easy and I was expecting to have to go back a couple of times to someone new until they got it just right. I was wrong.\n\nStacey nailed the color and was really nice to chat with too! Also a must when hanging in a chair for hours. \n\nHighly recommend... Although I may regret it if she gets too booked up :)"}
{"input": "Delicious! \n\nI wish they took reservations, but my friend and her fiance go there nice and early so that we could snag a seat inside (it was cold out!). \n\nWe ordered the bianco salad ( to share between 2) and the western addition (to share between 4).\n\nI thought the salad was tasty but nothing special, despite the white chocolate shavings. Cute idea, but not enough crunch or pizazz to make the salad seem really fabulous.\n\nThe pizza, however, was pretty darn good. We ordered it deep dish to try their special cornmeal crust and were pretty impressed. \nThe crust tastes a little bit like cornbread, a little bit like pizza dough, a tiny bit like grease (the good kind) and a lot like YUM!\n\nI don't know if it was the best pizza I've ever had, but it was very good. It would be even better if it were a tad cheaper, and didn't get so crowded! But definitely worth a visit if you're in the area!"}
{"input": "My18 year old daughter had a severe soar throat. We had seen another fast clinic in a CVS. A few days earlier and recieved a miss diagnosis of a fungus infection. She was prescribed an oral medication that made the condition much worse. We were the only patients at this clinic the entire visit and it took us over 1 hour. The staff were very robotic like in there behavior. I tried to ask a question on the way out and was told I was not aloud to be there. Very strange since I was already there. It felt like I was being hurried out the door. Keeping in mind there were no other patients in the facility during our visit I was confuses about the wait time and gruf  behaviour. I found the experience to be very unfriendly. It is best to have a good primary care physician and avoid these places at all cost."}
{"input": "Very cool bar attached to the Alexander Hotel. Several vintage cocktails from pre-prohibition are on the menu. None cooler than \"The Elephant in the Room\" a bourbon cocktail which comes in its own decanter filled with cherrywood smoke. You decide how long to let it infuse. Lots of comfortable seating and when it warms up a touch a large beautiful deck with seating and heating overlooks the street life. As an added bonus you can relax and watch people work out through the glass of the new CityWay YMCA. \nAnd yes the truffle oil and sea salt popcorn that greets every patron is as good as it sounds. Get a beer and start collecting bags, once you start you can't stop."}
{"input": "Don't do it.  \nI brought my VW in for service 3 weeks ago-turns out I needed a new accelerator.  My car sat at Walker for 3.5 weeks before my \"service director\" called to let me know I can pick the car up at my convenience.  Okay, so I pick my car up.  Drive it home.  Go inside to prepare for work.  About an hour later, I go to start my car to begin the drive to work... Car wont start.  I immediately called VW.  They played dumb, but told me to send it back to them.  That was a week ago and am still waiting on a return call regarding the status of my vehicle. \nOverall, the customer service sucks, the actual service sucks (and VERY expensive)  What more can I say?  Walker VW can be the kiss of death for your car."}
{"input": "The place is wonderful.  The food is excellent.  Though if you plan on going during the weekend, try to get there right at 8:00.  I had a party of five and got there around 8:25 and had to wait 20+ minutes to be seated.  I found it interesting that the staff chose to sit a group of 3 in an area that could have sat 6+.\n\nAgain, the Brunch was amazing and our waitress was the nicest waitress we've had in recent memory.  I've been there for brunch and for lunch.  Its the best.\n\nThough, the teenager hostesses need to figure out how to distribute guests better.  But what do you expect?  They're probably U of A students."}
{"input": "Wanting to find a place around downtown Philly to get brunch on Easter Sunday. We had a reservation at the red owl tavern and a good thing we did. It was very busy. But I giving a 4 star because although the service was excellent it took a little longer for our food to arrive then we wanted. I mean it is Easter Sunday but it shouldn't take that long. But all and all the food was excellent and I really had a good brunch. And the beer that I had wasn't the best it was a little bitter but still good"}
{"input": "I heart this TJ location as it's near my place of work and just off the freeway for a quick exit on 202 or 76 which can be important when you have a bag full of TJ's finest frozen cuisine. Only 4 stars bc on more than two occasions they've been out of my grocery staples like unsweetened almond milk and fruitsauce (how dare they?!) and the parking lot is super crummy and hard to get in or out of, not TJ's fault but still sour point. The staff is awesome and fun,  always willing to give suggestions and plugging their fav products, they are usually right about what to try. Also all TJs have the policy of if you don't like it, bring it back .. half eaten, used, etc. Awesome customer service here, great floral inventory, plus a wine & spirits just three doors down!"}
{"input": "I love love love facials with Becca at this beautiful spa. she is very professional and  knowledgeable on skincare along with Rescue's product lines. She makes me feel at very comfortable since I am seriously self conscience about my problematic broke out skin lately. I now use and purchased what Becca wrote out for me. Worth every penny; Lait U wash, PF50 toner, cream demopurifiante and mask vivant! She has given me hope again for clear skin! she also showed me how to apply with an upward motion and use baking soda once a week mixed with vivant for this face! Thank you Becca & Rescue see you all again soon! xoxo"}
{"input": "Great haircut, reasonable price, friendly barber!! Highly recommended.\n\nWent in to see Randy after reading such rave reviews, and they are accurate! I went in on a Saturday morning, wait was an hour but was worth it. He understood what I wanted done and did it very well. \n\nAlso as an added bonus he's got a friendly pooch and some sweet vintage bikes sitting around, quite a unique haircut experience!"}
{"input": "We've been looking for a good Italian restaurant and finally found it. The chicken piccata and spinach salad was delicious!"}
{"input": "This place is absolutely fantastic. Please know that I am Latina and Hispanic (from Argentina and lived in northern Mexico) and I am sufficiently impressed. I ordered their Atlantic Mahi mani tacos which were incredibly fresh and prepared with a variety of ingredients that made the flavors just pop in my mouth. The service is excellent and I also love the fact that they serve beverages that are non-alcoholic and traditionally Mexican (aqua de tamarindo and aqua de Jamaica) as well as red and white sangrias, and Tecate, Corona and Modelo Especial and they have a nice variety of Margaritas. So far I have only tried their classes, but look forward to enjoying the prickly pear one next time."}
{"input": "I can not say enough great things about this place. We sat at the bar and met the owner who was very friendly and wine knowledgeable. The food was delish with generous portions. The beer cheese is an absolute must. We will definitely be back."}
{"input": "Jason Lutzk, Chef de cuisine, is amazing! I have lived in the Tampa Bay Area all my life and our entire party of four agreed it was the best seafood meal we have ever had!  The sea bass, scallops, and crab & lobster cake all deliciously fresh and prepared to perfection. The presentation is incredible. Special note is the staff attention to detail. They are friendly, courteous and professional. The ambience with live piano music is a high end restaurant. Overal, superp!"}
{"input": "I've visited Costco locations in three different countries and you know what? There really aren't that many differences. Each Costco location has a good amount of bulk items along with some furniture, clothing, books and other items that one might want to buy. I visited with a friend recently to mostly buy some grocery items and personal care items and we were in and out of the store in less than 15 minutes. This location was very convenient, it wasn't very busy (we were there shortly after it opened: my friend mentioned that it was usually much busier), and while the parking lot had some ice and snow in it it was a pretty smooth shopping experience."}
{"input": "Best tasting and healthiest for the price point! Peanut butter Diego bowl has massive yummy energy"}
{"input": "The place sucks... When you come in in the movie theater there is a horrible smell.. Nobody greets you in when you come in like Cinebistro... There are not clean and the food is not good at all no seasoning... My seat have a nacho cheese on it.. They even gave the wrong dear number to another customer ... The employee run around with flash light while your watching the movie... The utensils is wrap on the cheapest disposable napkins ... And I don't even know why they are extra loose chairs inside the theater.. Carpet so dirty .... I rather go to muvico or amc .... This is the most sucky experience I ever experience..."}
{"input": "I enjoyed this self guided tour but it falls short of the Bureau of Printing and Engraving in D.C.  I missed the personal touch and pride so prevalent at the BPE.\n\nBut if you like the whole reading thing over the listening-and-asking-questions-thing, then this is for you, I guess."}
{"input": "I usually don't write reviews of chains unless they are really great or really awful. This Cracker Barrel verged on the latter.  I had gone there lusting after a chicken fried steak and this is what I got.  It wasn't bad nor were the scrambled eggs. What did disappoint me were the grits and the gravy. The grits were gummy and the gravy was kind of like paste with a hint of chlorine. Things that should be easy to make but just not good. The biscuit wasn't   bad but even it was a tad strange being more crispy than I would expect.\n\nEverything else was as good as you can expect in a chain but after this experience I think I'll keep on looking."}
{"input": "Nice experience! Food tastes homemade and fresh:) gelato delish and to die for! Would def return:) \n(Ps. Loved the chicken Parm!)"}
{"input": "I have been to many TeX Mex places in my life and was really disappointed in the place. The service was really bad and the did was mediocre bland and not worth trying out. I gave them one star but will not go back."}
{"input": "This place is kinda like a Bennihana without the show.  Which was fine with me cuz i just wanted a quick lunch.  The steak, chicken, and shrimp were ok.  Theres so many places to eat around there i would probably try another place the next time im in the area.\n\nThe lunch specials are a good deal."}

{"input": "Fantastic gym and walkable from the convention center! Good coaching and very welcoming to drop ins!"}
{"input": "I'm usually very particular about my nails and find myself bouncing from salon to salon trying to find a place that I love and trust. After years I finally found it! Luxe Nails is amazing! They are friendly, fast and most of all, they're really good at nails. I've had almost every nail tech there at this point and I'm never disappointed. The designs are great, their acrylic skills are on point, the price is SO reasonable (acrylic fill, gel polish AND a design for $34?!) and if you have an appointment you can get in and out in 45 minutes at the most. I really enjoy going there and start thinking about what design or color I want next because they can do just about anything."}
{"input": "I am new to Philly, and heard about Lauren and her community acupuncture within a month of living here. I love it! Lauren is so attentive, energetic, and nurturing. I have come in for various reasons, and Lauren has been able to provide relief every time. She is also been very responsive to follow-up questions and concerns I send her via email.\n\nI am very fond of the community aspect as well. The treatments are so affordable, and you get to be in a space with other people who are looking for healing and well-being also.\n\nI feel lucky to have found Lauren and her space - a true sanctuary in the city."}
{"input": "New owners bring true pride of ownership.  The place is small but had pretty much all you need.  If you are looking for a small, less busy, no screaming muscle monsters, check out this place.  Open 24 hrs.  Price is about $30/ month.  I will never go back to LA Fitness.  \n\n\nNew owner Mike is fantastic.  He just painted the inside and front of the building himself.  The place is meticulous and he is friendly and knowledgeable.  You just can't beat what you get for the money.  Plus, it's open all the time for members.   Now we that is convenient!"}
{"input": "Overall, this is a nicely appointed hotel with nice rooms, good service, and good amenities.  The exterior and facade is beautiful as is the common space in the hotel.  Carousel bar is nice and unique--definitely best hotel bar in NOLA (loews swizzle stick i like too), but is often too much of a zoo/scene.  The location is awesome, much better than being right on Canal in the ritz or right next to the casino out of the way at windsor court.  \n\nI generally don't deal much with hotel service when I stay in hotels but from the limited experience it's been good.  Generally I get in and out, which is always smooth here.  I've stayed in a few rooms on a few different floors.  The suites and larger rooms on upper floors are WAY nicer than the lower floors, but still there is no problem with even the smaller rooms.  My favorite part about Monteleone--the pool and spa aria!"}
{"input": "Holy Mole!\nThat was good. \n\nEnjoyed a wonderful evening here as part of a Yelp Elite event. Got to sample a wide variety of their food, and each dish was better than the next. The cocktail -- created special for the event, I think -- was fantastic (and I'm not usually a cocktail kind of guy...). The manager and staff are as attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly as could be. \n\nBasically, I consider the whole event an enticing appetizer for a much-anticipated main course: coming back for a full meal!"}
{"input": "I took my car to have the left headlight replaced, in Oct 2015. the price was reasonable. I had to take my car again in Dec 2015, because the headlight wasn't installed correctly(facing downward) it was fixed (no charge). And then again back to Sears auto Jan 27th because my headlight had gone out! At this point my blood is boiling! Because of employee negligence! Couldn't get it right the 1st time! Although I will say I wasn't charged, not that I would have paid for a headlight that I had already paid for 3 months ago! My headlight on the drivers side was replaced 2 yrs ago and as of today has not been replaced! Smdh.  I will NEVER TAKE MY CAR HERE AGAIN! Stay away!! Small details were overlooked. Needless to say, I didn't get good customer service and it's a good distance from my home, but close to my work."}
{"input": "This hotel was nice for the price! I stayed here one night this past weekend and I admittedly was not expecting it to be so nice. The bathroom was clean and very modern, the bed was comfortable with soft sheets, and the a/c worked well to beat the Florida heat. The floor to ceiling windows faced the building next door, but we had a peek-a-boo view of the river walk (see photo).\n\nThe valet guy was really nice and was willing to accommodate a guest I had coming to meet me. Next time I'm in town, this hotel will definitely be on my short list of places to stay - especially if the rates are the same as what I paid this time.\n\nThe decor was really trendy and the art in the lobby was hip. They have a nice cafe for breakfast and coffee. We didn't have time to enjoy the pool or bar or other amenities. But I did take a peek and they look really nice!!"}
{"input": "Great waiter, Kevin, brought is tablet to identify fish.  Food and drink OK."}
{"input": "We went on a friday evening around 5:30 and were seated outside on the covered patio right away. We ordered 2 apps and a flight. The chorizo nachos were huge and decent but the trout dip with pita bread chips is what stood out! The dip came out with 6 pieces of bread placed in a circle around the dip. I asked how much it would cost to get an order of more pita bread and guess what... it was free! score! \nSince both items were appetizers they came out in a matter of 5 minutes. All around it was a wonderful experience with good weather, great service, good food and a flight with information about each beer!"}
{"input": "It's not just a place to have a meal....it's an adventure!!! It's like foodie-Disneyland. Bring your appetite but eat first, or you'll buy everything in the store. Grilled caprese sandwich to die for, and have one of the Mazzaro eclairs....holy heaven!!"}
{"input": "My fiancé and I use to go here for dates when we started dating. We went back tonight and saw they expanded their menu. Their zha jing mein is delicious! Now they have limited time items like miso ramen. Their miso ramen is amazing. It was the closet ramen compared to Japan ramen here in Reno."}
{"input": "First time here - absolutely LOVE it....so happy!!!  The food extraordinary (especially smoked soft shell crab appetizer)... we all had the flounder - and all loved it. The converted church also amazing...love the settings."}
{"input": "Beers were amazing! I got the porter, the double IPA and the table gutt and they were all fantastic. Food was also killer if you like Russian cuisine. They had a special when I went with a sausage and sauerkraut which was tasty. I also got the pickled everything appetizer, great choice. This place rules."}
{"input": "I had already reviewed the Speedway location, which I think is far better.  We stopped for a Margarita at Casa Molina Del Norte, and while good, they were pretty overpowering.  Later on we had take-out from this location, and it was woefully poor compared to the Speedway locationl.  Maybe it's because of take- out, and not eat - in.  I feel that way about Chinese food...\nmaybe Mexican is the same as Chinese food... not as good as eating in."}
{"input": "I just went here for the first time today, and I LOVE it. I got a regular manicure for $12 (not including the $10 I tipped her), but I would have happily paid twice that. The manicurist worked quickly and professionally and was very attentive to detail. The little hand massage was great and she made sure that I was happy with how my nails were looking as she went. The whole process took about 45 minutes and my nails are flawless. All three ladies that were working were very sweet and accommodating. The salon itself is very clean with new-looking furniture and equipment, and the decor and lighting is quite calming. I'm definitely going back next week for a pedicure!"}
{"input": "I have been seeing Maria @ Rescue for brow tint and thread for a few months now. She has totally transformed my brows! They have gone from too light and sparse to my ideal eyebrow. I look forward to them getting better and better each time I see her. She is such a kind and warm person, I always feel great after I leave her chair. Thanks Maria!"}
{"input": "A great way to enter the 4th of July weekend with brunch at Prep and Pastry. The quality of food and pastry are excellent. Great vibe and place to be all year round! A great find in the Old Pueblo."}
{"input": "Great seafood. Had 1/2 shrimp and 1/2 oysters. The meal arrived at the table hot from the fryer.  Seafood was FRESH. Some of the best fried oysters I have had in a very long time beside Mike Andersons in Baton Rouge. I'll. E back when in Kenner again."}
{"input": "The reason I even knew about this place, is because of the duel over naming with Green lemon(previously lime). My favorite part about this place is the salsa bar, but it's not your average few varieties. They have extras like black bean corn & pineapple salsa. The fajitas are good, but I feel a tad on the expensive side for a quick order place. I love that they have yelp offers though! I got 20% one time for checking in while wearing my scrubs."}
{"input": "This is a fun little bar that seems like it might be the kind of place to really let loose. I wasn't really in a karaoke kind of mood, but it was fun hearing those brave souls step up to the mike and give it their all. Props to the strong drinks!"}
{"input": "Great fresh food and gracious service, amazingly quickly. We will definitely return soon. Recipes are so much better than most Thai places we have visited,  with beautifully served fresh dishes from appetizers through entrees."}
{"input": "This place is definitely fun if you're coming to get wasted. On the other hand, if you're looking for a tasty meal, this is NOT THE PLACE. I ordered shrimp tacos, rice and beans. The shrimp had no flavor or sauce. Just shrimp, lettuce, tomato, and cheese. Absolutely boring and dry. Also ordered a Jack and Sprite.  Whoa...a little more sprite would be appreciated. The service was excellent. Food bad. Drinks bad....unless being obliterated is your goal."}
{"input": "Daniel was great. Very friendly and knowledgeable. He showed up early for the appointment and was ready to find the issue with my AC. \nMy favorite part of Daniel's service was that he explained everything that he was doing and why he was doing it. I find that extremely helpful."}
{"input": "Okay food. The biscuits are good. Be warned! They will try and trick you into ordering extra sauces and spreads. It's almost $1 just for a little bit of citrus butter which is too expensive for the quality."}
{"input": "Quiet, good service, good fish, standard (boring and tasteless) app and salad, nice decor, good menu. Would go back. Would avoid the salad. Happy hour M-Th 5-7 drinks and appetizers."}
{"input": "My bad... I was in the Crescent City last March and took this tour and forgot to leave a review!!  I've been on quite a few walking tours in the city and this is THE BEST one I've ever taken.  It encompasses way more than the other ones offered. You won't regret taking this one as you get it all along with getting to follow the history of the Duparc-Locoul family."}
{"input": "Waitresses are great but kitchen staff needs to pay better attention to orders , my food allergy could have caused me issues and I know waitress noted my order down correctly.  Plus they didn't get orders correct at neighboring tables as well."}
{"input": "Often loaded with people many of us avoid, this beautiful historic park gets a bad rap at times. It's enjoyable to walk through it under the big hanging branches. There's a fountain in the middle, near a monument that commemorates those who perished in a world war I think. There is an underused stage along the north side available for community events. \n\nThis is also the PSTA downtown bus depot, so bus parking spaces on three sides and a kiosk selling bus passes. Panhandlers are not unknown, along with people who linger here all day on the many benches who are probably homeless. The park has improved in recent years, hope it continues to."}
{"input": "They would have gotten 5 stars if it weren't for the margaritas\n\nSeriously this place is BOMB.\n\nI've been here a few times now and tried a bunch of different things. A MUST GET is the Veggie Wings appetizer. I'm not a vegetarian, but SHIT these things will rock your world. It's seitan and it's just a little crispy, awesome wing sauce and your choice of blue cheese or ranch.\n\nThe pickle chips (fried pickles) -- awesome as well! They come with this spicy mayo dipping sauce. And they're so so worth it. \n\nThe menu is split up into texas-style and mexican-style. I've had stuff from both sides. Pretty much can't go wrong.\n\nThe tacos were delicious. I had the carnitas (YUM), my friend had the vegetarian cactus and sweet potato (she said they were amazing).\n\nThe service is awesome. They're friendly and fast without being pushy. Great people watching.\n\nThe only bad thing are the margaritas. Not sure what it is about them, but not my favorite. But definitely not a deal breaker, next time I'll just get a beer!!"}
{"input": "Great service, large portion size and reasonable prices. My new favorite place to go for dinner. We will definitely return."}
{"input": "I had Hahka Kitchens do my kitchen remodel and could not be happier.  The process was so smooth from the moment I walked in \"just to get a rough estimate\" to the finish. They couldn't be nicer people to work with.  Linda is a great designer and Randy is an excellent contractor.  We came up with several solutions to things that I didn't care for.  I love the cabinets I choose with the door style and finish.  The hardest selection to make was the Cambria quartz countertop and they were very patient in ordering larger samples of a number of options.  My kitchen remodel turned into a kitchen remodel with new flooring and a few changes in the bathroom and Randy was happy to answer all of my questions. The Ocampo brothers did excellent work installing the cabinets and hardware.  They were so pleasant to have working in my home and were very careful when installing my appliances."}
{"input": "Pork al pastor was delicious! Friendly staff and great service! Stopped in for lunch on a Sunday and got seated right away & they were showing the football games. Our waiter was attentive and our food didn't take long at all."}
{"input": "This is probably one of my favorite burgers I've had in a while. I'm not a terribly into burgers, so that's saying something. I got the 4 Cheese Garlic burger with a side of Mac and cheese, both delicious. The buns are definitely one of the best parts of the burger. My boyfriend got the 96 with a side of fries and loved it. The only thing I would say is that the patties are very thick. So, if you're a thin burger lover, this isn't for you. To finish, I got the ABC milkshake-- AMAZING. You can see my reaction in the photo. Overall, delicious and will be back again."}
{"input": "The Tater-Tots were good but not anything I haven't  had before. Burger was satisfactory.  Quick stop for lunch.  Staff was helpful with providing directions to local attractions."}
{"input": "Excellent! Love the location-- fun upscale decor. Service was perfect-- knowledgeable, respectful, and fun. I'm sure this place will end up busy and packed, but for now, it feels like a secret I want to keep! We ordered small plates-- flatbread pizza, butternut squash soup, and house salads. Dinner was filet medallions, salmon, burger and tuna poke. Everyone loved their meals and drinks. We will be back soon!"}
{"input": "Thanks SO much to Jacob... \nA beautiful day spent skiing at Squaw ended with my realization that I had lost our car keys somewhere on the mountain. I had Security call every lift we'd hit and they took my name in case the keys were turned in. Do I call Toyota? Do I have to tow my car back to SF? I looked up \"locksmith\" on my phone's Google Maps app and Alpine came up (their Truckee office). Jacob had obviously dealt with the situation before. He gave me a price quote in about 30sec and gave me an accurate time frame as to when he could get to Squaw. He even called when he was running a few minutes late. We enjoyed a nice happy hour in the meantime and when he got to the parking lot, I think it took him less  than 4min to get our key code and create us some new keys. Thanks for saving the day! Honest, quick service. Hope I never need to call them again under the same circumstances, but they'll be the first I call I make if I lose another set of keys. (Alpine accepts AAA)."}
{"input": "We finally made it to the Best in the West Nugget Rib Cook-Off this year.  We didn't stay as long as I had hoped since food coma set in real quickly but we had a good time nonetheless :)  There were so many rib vendors it just smelled awesome walking around.  They also had a section that sold other goods you'd find at a typical flea market.  Our favorite ribs we tried was definitely Bone Daddy's; the ribs fell off the bone, was not dry at all, and their bar-be-que sauce was totally yum!  Goodi's Lemonade was a great way to wash it all down and the hubby loved how there were many bar/alcohol vendors set up around the cook-off also.  Definitely coming back next year and this time we are not eating at all before we head out."}
{"input": "OMG!!! I can't believe this kind of service exists!  My husband called to make an appointment for full detailing for next Sat with Michael, he called again to confirm on Fri before we head there since it's a distance from our home.  Michael said he didn't know we wanted to do full detailing thou we specifically mentioned that.  He advised us to come the following sat instead.  We agreed and we reached there at 8am on the following week.  Guess what?  Nobody is at the workshop, it's closed!  We called him and he said he is busy and will call back.. We waited for half an hour in our car and there is still no call from him.  We headed for our breakfast and came back again at 9:30am hoping to give him another chance.  Here comes Alex, his partner opening the shop at 9:30am!  1.5 hours away from our appt time and still no sight of Michael.  Alex tried calling Michael and couldn't get hold of him.  We gave up!!! What a horrendous experience!"}
{"input": "We checked in to the hotel later in the evening and commented on the new look and feel of the place. The front desk staff noted they just opened the facility the week before, so it is a brand new hotel!\n\nIt was a great experience and fair price. Extra bonus being one of the first to stay in the new facilities.\n\nBreakfast was good and all the staff very friendly. Overall a great experience. Great location with easy access to to major roads and points of interest."}
{"input": "A wee bit pricey for the portions they serve. I come to Beck's for their gator gumbo over jambalaya. The whole thing is just so savory and the spices are just right. It's not overly spicy and not too salty as well. It's a great meal. The gator is in a sausage form. All chopped up into the gumbo. During this visit, I had to order their pasta. Chicken alfredo, for my 2 year old son. It was alright. The whole pasta tasted a bit dry. It's something I wouldn't get twice.\n\nVerdict - Gator gumbo, end of story."}
{"input": "What an excellent find.  Aubrey at the bar was super knowledgeable about whiskey, new favorite place when Im in town....awesome time!"}
{"input": "This is always my go-to Wawa, less than a mile from my house. Probably one of the only places around (besides McDonald's) that is open 24/7. Gas is open 24/7 as well. All the food is the same in Wawa to me, but it is a pretty big store compared to other ones around the area I've been to. The only thing I don't like is that sometimes their ATMs do not work."}
{"input": "The best Churros with chocolate in town.. loved the tamarind vinaigrette in the salad.. service is great.. cantina kinda place.."}
{"input": "Been going to this place since I was a small child. Always loved the soft serve ginormous vanilla cone! The Italian ice was good here as well, but not sure if they still serve that these days... I highly recommend if you're in the area and need some relief from the FL heat. :)"}
{"input": "Best sushi place in the area! I've been to Hachi multiple times and the service is always top-notch. Great lunch prices and options! Lunch comes with soup and salad, which is rare for this area. The salad is great, with fresh greens (not romaine, or iceberg) and GREAT ginger dressing. It's perfect. \n\nThere are many options for the sushi lunches and all great. My mother is in love with the salmon tempura and my boyfriend is obsessed with the mushroom shiitake. He is vegetarian and they have multiple sushi options for him.  The spicy mayo is fantastic, FYI. \n\nThe bento boxes are great and filling since they give you a lot of food!! Plus it's yummy. I recommend the shrimp teriyaki. \n\nUsually at the end of the meal, they bring out oranges and pineapple, which is a nice touch. \n\nI have not been there for dinner, only lunch since they have great deals. Go between 11:30 am - 3:30 pm since that is when the lunch specials are."}
{"input": "A laid back bar for the college crowd. Cheap drinks.  They have projectors so u can watch the big game that day. However the screen needs to be two feet wider so the picture doesn't go off into the wall.\n\nI came here during the day so it was really spacious, but I can only imagine how it is at night."}
{"input": "It's a new boutique hotel located out in the middle of nowhere so both the wireless and wired internet don't work for business travelers located especially on the fourth floor.  Management is helpless to do anything to restore the internet connection so they will just give you the 1-877 number of their helpless internet service provider who will just reset the wifi router on your floor to no avail.  Lucky for you, the hotel serves better continental breakfast than your Best Western hotel, and unlike other hotel chains, it offers free hot appetizers and alcoholic beverages such as beer and wine every weeknight."}
{"input": "We came here for lunch with a coupon. In order to use the coupon you HAVE to purchase a drink. This caveat was NOT PRINTED on the coupon.\n\nCashier at front of restaurant had a surly and impatient attitude when we inquired about this!\n\n\"Hostess\" wasn't too friendly either!\n\n\"tuna\" sashimi was mushy ?????????????????????????\n\nNefarious and sketchy-looking clientele."}
{"input": "Dang! This place was really refreshing! Great coffee, helpful kind and knowledgeable staff. This is my type of breakfast, coffee and a baked good or even a delicious avocado toast is the only way I like to start my morning, simple. Great art. Parking is way too easy as well!"}
{"input": "1. Small comfortable feel\n2. Rear parking & easy card access\n3. $35/mo single person\n\n1. Can never find the remote to get bloomberg off the many TVs\n2. Lacks a real ab machine\n3. Can be cramped at peak hours; avoid"}
{"input": "this place SUCKS. Terrible service and overpriced mediocre food. This is my second time with the same results. I gave them the benefit of the doubt -perhaps having an off night the first time I went, but it was the exact same the second time around. Nothing innovative. They churn tables out and could care less that you are spending upwards of $150 for two. Save this one for the tourists."}
{"input": "Horrible place to live. Horrible customer service. They powerwashed the roof and slug came thru our A/C and stained the carpet and they have yet to come clean it up after a month. Zero lights at night so have fun walking up the stairs with your groceries. There are so many choices in this area for apts, KEEP LOOKING ELSE WHERE!!!! Even if there is a good price, they will increase the rent after one year by 20-40 percent, so if you like moving and packing up all your furniture n clothes, then move right in. If you're looking for a place to live where rent wont increase and force you to move out, then PASS ON CAMDEN BAY!!! Id recommend checking out Westchase area apts. Its a much nicer area, with all the amenities you need."}
{"input": "I was very impressed! I had a plain glazed and a glazed with a lemon filling. I would go back again if I ever find myself in Indy."}
{"input": "Cally's is, in my opinion, the best tea shop in Edmonton! The baked goods are superb and the teas are of excellent quality. One of my favourites is the rose tea - it smells just like real rose petals and the taste comes through nicely in the brew.  The atmosphere is perfect so all in all visiting Cally's results in an excellent tea experience!"}
{"input": "Try the spinach and feta hummus, it is amazing. I had the chicken caesar pita and if was wonderful. The caesar dressing was very flavorful and the greens (romaine, mixed greens, etc) were good quality and flavorful (not your typical bagged junk). Pulling up the the place I was skeptical (they're in an old garage) but give it a try, well worth it."}
{"input": "Waited 3 hours between buying the tickets and enter to the haunted asylum, it was not scary at all and it just lasts 13 minutes. Not worth it.  While waiting in line, someone started to throw balls and it hit a few people."}
{"input": "This is possibly my favorite sushi place in Philly. The ambiance isn't awesome, but the service is attentive, and the food is great. They have a bunch of interesting/creative rolls, and the fish is fresh and tasty. Plus the rolls are pretty large."}
{"input": "Busy place for lunch. I see why. \nGood food, menu choices from Pad Thai to Hamburgers.\n\nGluten Free beware: Their Gluten free chocolate cake dessert is served, (or was served until I got sick) with a wheat wafer covering the entire top!  What? Good thing my tongue knew right away and stopped after the first bite.\nAnd this was after an entire meal of talk with the server about my allergy, not sensitivity.\n\nStill would return. \n\nLove the Open Table points too. Which is hard to find during lunch in this area."}
{"input": "If you are a tea drinker this is the place for you.   \n\nDrinking tea is more then putting a bag in a cup of hot water.  There is a process and there are tons of choices of tea leaves. \n\nPlenty of KNOWLEGABLE staff to help assist.\n\nTea is a bit expensive but then again we never purchased tea leaves before so maybe it's reasonable.\n\nThere are free samples.\n\nSince this chain is part of Starbucks you can use your star rewards to redeem tea leaves.  Definitely better then redeeming a cup of coffee."}
{"input": "Riesling was nice and the coldwater scallops appetizer was my favorite.  The short ribs appetizer was terrible, it was tough and dry with a weird gamey flavor to it.\n\nThe passion fruit creme brulee was good, but overall not a 4 star restaurant in my opinion.\n\nHowever, we'll give the other restaurants in its family (East and Lazia) a chance."}
{"input": "We won't be back. We got the Brussel sprouts and they tasted like pure salt. Our server sent them back and we got another batch and they tasted exactly the same. My husband got the burger and it was okay but the fries that came with it tasted like pure salt also. Maybe the cook working this night was just a little heavy handed on the salt, I don't know. I got the flank steak and it was okay. I wouldn't rave about it or ever get it again. Our cocktails were good and the atmosphere was nice, but we were really disappointed with the food :("}
{"input": "Affordable, amazing service, and a great location. I loved grabbing dinner here with my husband for a quick date out. I would have tried everything on the menu if I could have, but make sure you at least try the baklava. :) will definitely be coming back."}
{"input": "The Sunrise Family Restaurant is an old style diner that has a very small-town, homey feel.   Service is prompt and super friendly.\n\nI had a Monte Cristo sandwich per the waitresses recommendation and I won't lie, it was pretty disappointing.  Take a stack of turkey and a couple thick slices of ham out of their respective industrial packs, microwave them with some swiss cheese on top and serve on limp french toast.  Somebody out there might like it.  I didn't. \n\nIt came with a salad and fries, both of which were good.  The fries were thick steak fries cooked to a perfect golden brown.   \n\nI have a feeling there are some good items on the menu.  I would especially be interested in trying breakfast.  I'll be back."}
{"input": "Love this restaurant! Fabulous food, excellent service, beautiful decor, one of my favorite high-end restaurants in the city!"}
{"input": "Straight to the point, it's cheap, it tastes and feels cheap\n\nThe good: price, location, dessert (edible food items are: baked chicken, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, Salad bar lol, meat and cheese bar, ravioli, pizza) also our waitress was bomb af\n\nThe meh: behind counter meat slicing station, shrimp (not even deveined), Mexican station\n\nThe bad: breakfast -worst eggs ever, actually worst, eggs. Le Benedict can't even cut through ham or English muffin (tried on all 3 occasions), steak, shrimp again, hell breaded items can't even, don't even. Decor it's the 1970 nightmare you can imagine\n\nTried 3 times and failed"}
{"input": "When I'm in SB I Always make a stop here for some great food.\nHad  beef and broccoli and it was delicious. \nFull of flavor and good portion. \nLike to be my own critic because everyone has different opinions about food.  Will definitely come back."}
{"input": "DON'T BOTHER GETTING THE GROUPON. The sushi was terrible and they DIDN'T HONOR the Groupon because I didn't present it when I was seated. I've used many, many Groupons in other establishments and have never been refused. I called Groupon and got a refund from them and reported that Yakuza did not accept it.\n\nBIG THUMBS DOWN for Yakuza, thumbs up for Groupon."}
{"input": "This is my happy place in New Orleans; even if not a guest of the hotel (which I always try!) I must stop for a cocktail at the carousel bar.  It is sublime; I only wish it was further from Bourbon St.  The rooms have the old grandeur you would expect with superior service. Yes, it is pricier than others in the area but worth every cent."}
{"input": "Excellent museum. \n\n1) The building is beautiful. \n2) There is a nice collection. \n3) They are helpful with questions and recommendations. \n4) It is FREE!"}
{"input": "While there are many Bath & Body Works that are larger in size than this one, this B&B offers everything one needs and wants from the chain. For those of you that have never tried their products before, you must! The products here are fantastic. My cousin has eczema and this is the only place she can buy hand soap."}
{"input": "I've been here for several blow outs and I highly recommend! The entire staff is talented and I love how you can book online. I usually see Krissy or Bianca, but everyone is great and super friendly. I also recommend getting a vital shot with your blow out. It is a deep conditioning product that doesn't add extra time to your visit but makes all the difference! I am blonde so I am always trying to keep my hair conditioned, and the vital shot lasts about a week!"}
{"input": "I have to say I have NEVER written a review. I've never had that overwhelming feeling to let others know if a service was good or bad.   I finally know what that means after having my crazy, curly, unruley hair for 42 years.  I have had the privilege to meet Carleen who is AMAZING with curly hair.  She not only styled it for me but all her staff herself included taught me how to style it.  That was HUGE for me.  I have depended on ponytails and clips most of my life.  She has truly changed my life in ways I couldnt imagine.  I am actually learning how to do my hair & love mu curls as much as my husband loves them.  Thank you for being so patient and wonderful.  You have changed my life. Ive only been there once and I already love you girl.  I can thank you enough.  Im so glad I found you on yelp. Love ya girl."}
{"input": "Great food and excellent service. Only knock I would give them was they brought out our entrees about 10 minutes after our apps came so we were still eating that, otherwise great experience"}
{"input": "I wasn't really impressed. When I got to the counter, the cashier barely even looked at me. I had to ask him if he was ready for my order. I ran next door to pick up the take out dinner I had order while my donuts were being prepared and they almost didn't let me back in because they were closing and thought I was a new customer. The donuts were good and I appreciate them being fresh but waiting for each one to be made makes for a long wait. Plus, they are all the same base. No chocolate donut or cream filled, etc. I'd probably just go to Dunkin next time for the variety and speed."}
{"input": "We spent about 3 hours here today with our 14 month old grandson. He had a blast! There are plenty of picnic tables and shady areas. All the children were mindful of him as he ran around in the water play area. It was pretty busy but it's spaced out so well that we never felt like we were in the crowd.  He also loved walking out on the pier.  We live in  Sarasota and I wish we had a park this beautiful. We will go back."}
{"input": "The Dallas Bull never disappoints! Having been a regular on Thursday nights, we decided to give Saturday a try. The crowd was light in the early hours but it sure got crowded around 11pm. Bar service was decent and I didn't have to wait too long to get a drink. My only complaint is that the new DJ doesn't count in the songs which leads to chaos on the dance floor as many people don't know when to start the line dance correctly. This lead to me getting stepped on quite a few times (which is not fun when people are wearing cowboy boots and think they know how to line dance). Hopefully they will get the DJ to start counting in the songs!"}
{"input": "Food is awesome. I'm a vegan and love their menu options and details on vegan and vegetarian options. I gave them 3 stars because of their outrageously slow service. The owner walks around in the way not able to even answer the phone to take orders. I told the waitress he just needs to stay home observing him look totally oblivious to EVERYTHING. Servers are all nice and food is great. Come here only if you are patient."}
{"input": "I love Chick-Fil-A so much and was so excited to get one down the street from me! No more sudden realizations that I'm in Rivergate or Cool Springs and should take advantage of a Chick-Fil-A. I could go any time!\n\nBut. What. The. Hell.\n\nApparently Nashvillians don't know how to use a double lane drive through.\n\nAnd may I ask why the drive thru goes around the front of the restaurant instead of the back of the restaurant like every other damn fast food restaurant?\n\nThough, kudos for the free WiFi that I can use on my phone while I'm waiting twenty minutes in line at the drive thru.\n\nSo I avoid this place like the plague. I'll wait til next time I'm in Rivergate or Cool Springs for some amazing waffle fries."}
{"input": "Great classic Greek diner. The Greek omelette with feta, gyro meat, tomato and spinach was super. Classic griddle home fries and outstanding service. We will seek it out when we return to the area."}
{"input": "Best pedicure around!!! Love how they take their time and always make me feel like I'm welcome"}
{"input": "I used to think this place was amazing. During office hours the place is fantastic but grabbing food during a night out? Don't even do it . All the workers assume every patron who comes at night is a drunk. So asking simple questions is automatically a reason to yell and refuse service. Customer Service is absolutely horrible. I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN. there patties have shrunk and price has remained the same. This place has definitely taken a dive from what it used to be."}
{"input": "Walked in to a pretty busy restaurant at 8:15pm. Owner came over and offered to make a table for us. How accommodating. They basically put two tables in front of the bench you sit at when you're waiting for a table and put chairs on the other side. And first round of drinks on the house. Great service!  We will definitely recommend this place. Kept coming over to check on us and make sure we weren't missing anything. Live music adds to the great ambiance. We had tacos, the mahi stuffed with crab special, tuna steak, snow crabs, fresh grouper (and it was fresh) and the kids ate up all their food (philly cheese steak, pasta in Alfredo sauce, cheeseburger and chicken nuggets). No complaints. Everything was tasty. Good choice on our part."}
{"input": "I never waited longer than 10 mins for pho. but dam, it was worth the wait! I've been to so many pho restaurants... but the broth on this pho was amazing. the proportion was good too. the vietnamese sandwiches were good, but if you don't state what you want on it, they'll put everything on it...including peppers. The boba tea was good and the service was decent. The ambiance and decor of this place is legit. The only issue witht his place is that it's pretty small and parking kinda sucks, and your food may take long to receive after ordering. But like i said, the pho was bomb.com! found my new pho spot in the area!"}
{"input": "Probably one of the best places to get food in the city.  They're innovative and awesome people at this place, I will always recommend this place!"}
{"input": "Ordered take out from this place tonight. It was by far the worst meal I have ever had. I ordered the chicken parmesan. This is a pretty hard dish to screw up but they did a fine job of it. It was an unidentifiable piece of gray rubbery meat (I think). The breading was soggy and I needed a steak knife to cut the chicken. I literally could not chew it, it was so tough. The garlic bread it came with, was also disgusting! It was greasy and hard. Yuck! My husband had a sauted chicken campagniola with veggies which was marginally better. The chicken was so overdone, it made it hard to stomach. The food was so disgustingly greasy that the brown bag they gave us broke. Uggh!  If you get food from this place, be warned. Maybe stick with the pizza."}
{"input": "Awesome! Great place. The staff are friendly and met all our needs. Very great energy. Each shake is handmade to perfection like a work of art. If you are diabetic this is a no no for you. It was soooo good! The owner even came out and spoke with customers. She has such a beautiful spirit! So happy we stopped by! We couldn't even eat it all. My recommendation is to share."}
{"input": "Really good chicken tenders. Overpriced.  Drive-thru was fast and friendly. Would go back again."}
{"input": "My father and sister had been there many times - with all their problems. The staff - doctors, nurses, technicians have all been wonderful, helpful and knowledgable.\nThis past week and half my father had been in hospice there. I can't say enough about the staff there. They are amazing - its not just the training, but these caregivers put their hearts out there. They all take the time to learn about the family, they understand our desires, and take care with explaining all the details. They are absolutely the most compassionate group of people I have ever met - I can't thank them enough!!!"}
{"input": "One of the worst service experience.\nI ordered egg roll and the pho.\nEgg rolls came out covered with burn crumbles all over and very drak color of the shell and you could the content pretty much black color as if it was almost burned or at the least fried in the last drop of over used burned oil and I could not posssibly put it in my mouth. When I was explaining that Im concerned things are too burned, the owner lady walked up and snatched the plate away from me without saying anything. I did not know if they ate bringing another one or not. Only after I grabbed my waiter later he said they are not making another one ans would take it off my check. \nAbsolutely rude, not communicating, disrespectful of their customers.. \nthe only reason I came was because the neighboring miss saigoin restaurant was flooded but I think it's worth a wait compared to this place if I want to spend any money for pho and walk out feeling happy :("}
{"input": "I like their salads, tea, and french fries! The servers were great...I've been here a few times and I'd come back!"}
{"input": "I can't say enough about Belinda and Jerry! They were so helpful and kind. I am a travel nurse and was leaving my car in Boise for the winter. I came in on a snowy December evening and Balinda reassured me that she would stay and wait for me and Jerry even drove me to my storage shed and helped me with my luggage.\nI am so happy with storage experiemce here and with the service I received. I highly recommend!!"}
{"input": "The food is not very good. The only thing nice is the environment."}
{"input": "I've been here 5 times, and ordered the Chicken Veracruz Salad. I love it! (Almost obsessed with it lol) The cashier/server has always been nice and helpful. I'll keep going back!"}
{"input": "Perfect place to celebrate my birthday. Everything from the service to the robust/perfectly seasoned food to the warm and rustic ambiance... Simply amazing."}
{"input": "Wonderful casino/hotel experience. My son decided to get married in Reno, so we all flew up from San Diego and stayed over the weekend at the Peppermill. Rooms were fantastically comfortable and room service is ALWAYS my favorite. Don't do much gambling, but it looked just as crowded as the casinos in SDiego. Parking was easy and lots of spaces available for handicap. Employees of both the hotel and casino were friendly and helpful. The weather cooperated and didn't rain. If it had been a few months later we would have been knee deep in snow! That would have been interesting, right? We rented a car and my wife signed me up to drive the single ladies back and forth from the hotel to the vinue and back. Thanks honey! I shouldn't complain, how often does an old guy get a car full of lovely young women? Keep it clean! It was nice that I could help my son out and chauffeur his friends. Anyway, if you're going through Reno, stop by (or stay) at the Peppermill and check it out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"input": "By far one of my favorites in Reno and my go to choice. One of the few places I find I need no added soy sauce. Service isn't the greatest but they are very quick and make sure I always have food in front of me. They also have great daily specials."}
{"input": "Royal Street Bark...mmm...I'm dreaming of our next encounter.\nOhh...I can order you online, you say? \n\nF*. The. Diet.\n\nThe fudge is also a winner...if \"littered\" candy goodness isn't your bag...Sorry, I just can't justify giving this place 5 stars for making my ass look fat ;)"}
{"input": "Nothing extraordinary, but if you want some simple Chinese takeout, this is the best place around. The food seems less greasy than you sometimes find and the people are super nice."}
{"input": "It was good, not great. Good location. Receptionist was very helpful but the hotel didn't have a toothbrush in stock."}
{"input": "O! Wings has the best wings!! Hot momma and the original for the win!! Oh! And the bulgogi wrap. My dad, who's very picky, even praised the wings and wrap! \n\nTheir service and attitude is very very friendly and accommodating. \n\nI phoned in a to go order originally for 6 people. Later half an hour before the pick up time, I added 10 more entrees. They were very very accommodating and had me ready to go and out the door in 15 minutes! \n\nYumm! Can't wait to go back for more!"}
{"input": "Gator gumbo with fried mac and cheese.  Great food with just the right amount of kick for a late lunch."}
{"input": "Been coming here for years and love it. The owner Ken is a riot and always fun to hang around with. Food is good as usual and they serve a good late night crown. A lot of the seafood is fresh, as you can see them fetching it from the live tanks after you order!  Overall, great place. Perfect for parties and get togethers!"}
{"input": "Bevan did an absolutely amazing job on the independence mall tour. He knew so much history and made it really interesting to listen to. If school had been like that I probably wouldn't have had my cousin do my homework!\n\nIt was a long tour (2 hours) but wasn't overwhelming or long winded. We learned so much and really enjoyed our time in Philly."}
{"input": "Went to ocharleys on a Sunday afternoon, it wasn't too busy but I guess our server was overwhelmed. He forgot our bread and butter. Forgot my fries multiple times, I was halfway done with my sandwich when my fries finally arrived. We got my son Sprite refilled at the bar after waiting so long for our waiter. We had a coupon that we told the server to add to our bill. Well he forgot to ring it up correctly, he got the manager to fix it. I might give ocharleys another try for lunch instead of dinner."}
{"input": "We were early for church and wanted to grab a quick bite to eat. The atmosphere was really inviting and everyone on staff spoke to us at least once! \n\nThe food was good, but not great. I had quiche and my guest had a croque madame. The crust of the quiche wasn't done and the bread on the croque wasn't that great. Otherwise these two dishes would have been perfect. The fruit was fresh and the coffee was great!\n\nI will definitely return."}
{"input": "After always shopping at the Randall's off Jefferson, it was nice to see West County get their own Randall's. Staff here is uber friendly and helpful. Beer selection is solid here, with plenty of styles to choose from.Prices are competitive with the other beer markets around. Well worth your time and money."}
{"input": "We chose this tour because of the raving reviews online AND because Voodoo Bone Lady herself usually does the tours. \n\nWe called ahead and confirmed she would be hosting the 5 in 1 ghost tour. We were stoked. \n\nThis hands down was an awesome tour! She is so charismatic, personable and knowledgeable. I would recommend this tour to anyone that goes to Nola! \n\nThank you Voodoo Bone Lady!"}
{"input": "My five-star review has a lot to do with the fact that Mr. Wizard's is about a quarter of a mile from my house, which means we can walk there, thus burning off about 1/10 of the calories we are about to consume. Another reviewer called the location \"Dogtownish\" but it is actually Richmond Heights-ish, meaning that it is really truly in Richmond Heights. It is right off of 64 on Big Bend, so if you're cruising through town hop off and try it! Also, if you are dining at any of the Maplewood establishments on Manchester, Mr. Wizard's is a pretty easy walk from there. \n\nNow to the good stuff: I can't vouch for all menu offerings, because my go-to is a concrete with butterscotch and pecans. Delicious! My bf likes the malts.\n\nI can't settle the Mr. Wizard's v. Ted Drewes argument because I am new to town, but it is very hard to imagine that Drewes serves anything better."}
{"input": "Pho is delicious!  Adding meatballs is a must.  They are so good. Fast and cheap with a $15 minimum for credit cards. All the phos are good but I especially like the seafood one.  Even though I've been many times, It's hard to go past the first page \n\np.s. if you're new to pho, add the basil leaves and lime to the broth.  if you want it spicier add some hot sauce.  Pho Hoa gives you a delicious base broth, but that doesn't mean you can't play with it."}
{"input": "Its a decent place. Not the best italian food I had, but it was good. I was here for restaurant week. I had the lobster ravioli, the meatball appetizer and the brownie dessert. It was all good, nothing stood out as the best thing I have eaten. It was pricey, but I wasn't disappointed. They have a good wine list to choose from. Overall, if you are in the area I would give it a try. Its not something I would trek a long way down to eat."}
{"input": "The manager of this McDonalds needs to teach the help the Big Mac jingle....It starts with Two all beef patties.....TWO....TWO...not one freakin patty you idiots! How can you forget to make a big mac and forget one of the burgers? It's not rocket science! Also the slowest and dimmest counter help to take orders. They take one order at a time and then b.s. with the help next to them while the lines get longer. \n So the advice is to make sure you ask for EVERYTHING you want them to put on a bun for you or it will be missing."}
{"input": "I was coming from a long day at the Eastern State Penitentiary so I looked around the neighborhood for a unique place to eat at. Stumbled upon this place and thought it was cute and cozy. It definitely had an antique bar vibe. The waitress/bartender was really nice. The food was average. I got the grilled chicken and brie sandwich. It was good but the honey mustard was more overwhelming than I expected...I think it was horseradish sauce because definitely tasted like wasabi and burned my nostrils! The fries were good (well seasoned). My boyfriend got a lackluster omelet and a big bowl of mussels. The mussels were okay. Overall cute neighborhood cafe."}
{"input": "Great breakfast! I had the egg, sausage, bacon, hash and short stacks! One of the best breakfast places I've had since Kirby Lane in Austin, TX! We will eat there again before we leave NOLA!"}
{"input": "Visited Shaving Grace on Friday for a hair cut.\n\nSame vibe as my old Barber Shop in Philly. \nBig TV in the waiting area. Plush couch to relax in. Young lady checking me in asked if I wanted water, soda or a beer.\nBeer? Need I say more. \n\nGreat cut. Great bunch of guys discussing current events, sports, and what's happening around town.\nFound my new spot. \n\nWill be back."}
{"input": "Burgers were ok. Service was a little slow, which was surprising considering it was dead in there. Apps were fantastic!"}
{"input": "I really liked the restaurant's food and atmosphere! Cool tiki bar/Mexican feel at the bar. I especially like this more than Bakersfield because it's not as pretentious which is refreshing. Good tacos and margaritas, we were very impressed by the spicy margaritas. Good job la revolucion good job"}
{"input": "Normally, evaluating a fast food chain would be absurd but..Church's Chicken rocks! So much better than KFC and if you are nursing a hangover, this hits the spot. The biscuits are buttery, sweet goodness. Mashed taters and gravy consistency is perfection. The right amount of stiffness without being a brick although I recommend a little salt and pepper to spruce up the taste.  Just like I remember from my Southern upbringing. Do not count calories at this place. And no, I do not make it a habit to hit up Church's on a weekly basis. I consider I nice treat every couple of months. Price is good and service is fast even when there is a line and there usually is a line at this location on Lindbergh in South County. If I am going to do fast food, this is my place of choice."}
{"input": "Don't be deceived by the fact that it is a little older, this place is meticulously maintained!! Every corner is clean and beautiful fixtures in the rooms. The room we had was small, but very nice. We were only in town 1 night, so bigger wasn't necessary. The courtyard is also beautiful with orange trees. Although it was January, the pool even sparkles. It is a short walk to several eateries. The wharf and the harbor access are also with walking distance."}
{"input": "Huge portions and very reasonable prices. It has a hole in the wall type of interior, but it's very clean kept. I've never had authentic Cambodian food anywhere else, so I can't make any comparisons, but I left with a very content (and large) belly!"}
{"input": "Excellent food, terrible service. The food is always fabulous, so much so that it would receive a 4-star if the service were good. Each time we have been in it takes 10 minutes to get water and your drink order placed. Then the food for the whole table never comes out together, normally one person is waiting on his/her dish. The ambience and decor is fabulous and I hope with time the service gets on par with the food."}
{"input": "Men's clubs is the tits, plain and simple. All the barbers got skills enough to hook it up fresh. Been coming here for 3 years and I've never had any problems. Except for maybe that one time when this dude tried to steal my cut. Tim kept it real though and said \"I can't give you the same cut as Ryan.\" Thanks Tim."}
{"input": "Simply amazing.  The whole experience.  First the entire staff was super friendly, including the owner Big B in the back making the pizzas.   He gave us some great recommendations and made us feel very welcome.  I ordered the rae-rae and it did not disappoint!  It happened to be a perfect day, so we sat outside.  Each of the staff came out to greet us, thank us for coming, and make some small talk.  I've never had a more enjoyable time eating some truly fantastic pizza before!"}
{"input": "A cheaper alternative to St Elmos, Harry and Izzy's has a more casual, but classy vibe, with an esthetically pleasing dining room with a menu that suits a variety of tastes. I felt the service was less formal, but more genuine, and of course the prices more reasonable, and the menu more varied."}
{"input": "Ever since I started working in the area a little over a year ago I dropped in to The Blue Duck for lunch and it quickly became a favorite. \n\nThe quack and cheese, duck fries, and anything off the brunch menu on Sunday's are out of this world. Dinner entrees are exceptional all reasonably priced for the quality of food. \n\nI've never had a bad experience here. Great service and great atmosphere. \n\nI try to make it in for one meal a month and if you've got the time you should too."}
{"input": "Norma did such an excellent job on my hair! I got some simple, elegant layers and she did an ever better job than the picture I brought her! She even gave me some helpful tips for my hair because I'm a swimmer. I will absolutely be returning!"}
{"input": "Their cocktails are amazing! I tried the Hooker with a Heart of Gold and it was delicious. Our group also tried the Pet the Rabbits, George - The 3rd Act and Build in on the Mountain. All were so tasty."}
{"input": "Soooo good!!! For only 6 bucks you get like half a pound of tender meats, melt cheeses, fresh veggies, and tender- crisp awesome breads that can feed two well!!  Lots of beverages and sides to choose as well. Awesome for lunch!! Grocery is amazing-- so many Italian imports of fancy jarred things! Excellent selection of fresh meats, seafood, spices, wines, amazing cheese room.. Mmm... Still warm handmade mozzarella... Oh my the cheese room odor alone is worth a few high end crackers... Mmmmmmm"}
{"input": "Out lunch today was pulled pork, smokehouse bowl, and delicious sides of sweet potato casserole and red beans and rice.   Red beans and rice was spicy but good. Sweet potato casserole yummy and meat was smoky juicy and plentiful. Definitely a must."}
{"input": "The kid at the front desk refused to get a manager or supervisor after I asked. The kid named derick told me I was touchy...very rude. Turns out the supervisor was nearby and I talked to him. (They all gave me different info so I gave up). The AC did not work properly in room. The restaurant and breakfast ran out of certain food items. The valet parking(only parking there) was backed up. They werent ready for a busy week but they were ready to jack up the price."}
{"input": "My favorite place for Italian eats! Have been going for the past 10 years and have never left disappointed. I recommend the steak bites with gorgonzola cheese dip appetizer and the cannelloni with rose sauce. I usually prefer the lounge to the restaurant because it has a great laid-back vibe, awesome music, excellent service and is generally not too busy. Oh! And the lounge also has free popcorn and board games every night. The Jasper Ave location pales in comparison, so make sure to go to the South one. Also, it's never a bad idea to go for the Sunday pasta special that's a giant family style plate of 5 different pastas for about $13 per person (of parties of 2 or more). All the snaps for this place."}
{"input": "This is the best place in town for great Chinese food. Everything is top notch and one of may favorite things is that they double as a Japanese restaurant with fresh sushi. So I can start out with an appetizer of sashimi and have Chinese for the main course."}
{"input": "4.5 stars for Bucks County.  I lived in NYC for 8 years and it's not as good as NYC pizza but it's awfully close.  The plus to this place is they make other things equally as good.  The cheesesteaks are better than any I've ever had in NYC.\n\nI prefer the Margherita pizza or something with meat on it.  The plain cheese pizza well done is what we usually get.  I think they deliver on weekends as well.\n\nThe price is right on this pizza as well.  \n\nThe people who work their are pretty friendly and they generally offer some garlic knots."}
{"input": "2nd visit. Tried all new items this visit and loved them all. Moroccan Chicken Piadina was delicious. Basil  Hummus was my fav. The icing on the cake is the lemon  cookies. Wow! Pro-tip: hummus is $3.99 at happy hour."}
{"input": "Good food, but to me it's not worth the horrible service or the rude staff, and they only take cash or checks and there's not even a sign at the front stating so; the sign is at their cash register all the way in the back on a wall not facing the dining room. I'm not very picky and I'm never rude, so this says a lot: horrible experience."}
{"input": "Very friendly, professional, and helpful people work here. I find a great piece of furniture -- good quality and in very good shape -- that didn't break my budget. BONUS: they offer very affordable interior design services as well."}
{"input": "Service and management terrible... After messing up all 4 of our orders the waiter got mad and started cursing... The manager offered our drinks to be free.. What a mess. The food was cold and nasty didn't even eat half of it and waited over an hour... I will never dine in any cracker barrel again after this experience..."}
{"input": "After a horrendous stay at the La Quinta airport in Nashville we stayed at this lovely place. Staff are soooo sweet and customer oriented.. Kathy at desk and the young black man and woman in the evening are GREAT...SO SWEET AND HELPFUL..good breakfast, comfortable room..only negatives are they need more seating areas for breakfast and need to service the fitness facility with towels, cleaning and empty trash. We will be staying here again. Thanks to the wo derful desk staff.. Breakfast staff were also exceptionally good."}
{"input": "Had dinner at Bailey's Range last night (10/27/11).  My wife and I had the ABC burger and the lamb burger and shared halves...this was a flavor explosionary experience! Everything about both burgers was awesome! The meat was delish, the buns perfect, toppings perfect.\n\nThe beer selection is all St. Louis area beer except no AB-InBev products which isnt St. Louis area beer anymore is it? The pickle was like the best pickle I've ever had and the ketchup was great too.  They actually make the pickles and ketchup themselves.  Fries were quite good, kindof a British-style chip, you  know a little translucent.  For soda lovers, they have an amazing array of non corn-syrup selections, i.e., cane sugar.  \n\nRest assured, I will be back for the wedge salad and the bison burger on another day."}
{"input": "Just ate here, with my wife, for the first time. Chilled at the bar, had a beer, and ate some pizza. Great service and good times!"}
{"input": "I lived here for 5 yrs this is the best breakfast I've ever had in Tucson. The service was awesome too."}
{"input": "this steakhouse is very professional, calming and relaxing. staff are nice, they were nice and funny. we will definitely will be coming back here. good choice of menu, food came here quickly and was delicious. the place is so chill, inside was very pleasant looking, our family enjoyed it and we were happy with our visit, will come back here again."}
{"input": "Just had the very best spa experience ever. \nI travel a lot for work and enjoy finding new places. Pia is my new favorite. \nNicole is a breath of fresh air. She should be teaching a course on customer service and facials. I've had plenty of treatments, but Nicole's sandblasting and scrubbing topped them all. How refreshing to walk out of a salon having had your expectations exceeded. The room was calming, the atmosphere peaceful and the products used were first rate. I had the $175 ninety minute procedure. Shoulders, arms and feet were all thoroughly massaged and my face has never been cleaner. I even looked twenty years younger when I left. \nAside from a fantastic facialist, Nicole is a delight ! Five stars for both Pia and Nicole!"}
{"input": "If I could give them 0 stars I would. Horrible customer service. I order my coffee as follows, cold brew, no water, 2 shots. This tote always gives me and issue with this order saying that they cannot make it as follows, although the app offers that as an option for online ordering, and every other Starbucks out there has zero complications with this order. Infuriating."}
{"input": "True barber shop. You can tell they care about giving great haircuts. Very reasonable price. This place was recommended by two different friends so I had to check it out. I'll be going back."}
{"input": "First time here, was recommended by some friends. The place was pretty busy when we when on a Monday night which was a good sign.\nWe were greeted promptly and seated,a server took a drink order right away, another good sign.\nThey brought out garlic rolls, another good sign.\nWe ordered different pastas and baked clams, all very good.\nThis is not a high end place, it's a good neighborhood spot if you're in the mood for Italian and don't want to spend a fortune.\nWe will return and next time see what the desert menu looks like."}
{"input": "Had a Groupon so went in for a basic mani /pedi, she did an amazing job, great attention to detail and she was wonderful about working with me to have my daughter come in for services the following week. I have found my new mani / pedi place!"}
{"input": "Nice little place in Carp with vegan and vegetarian options. Self serve salad bar with fresh local organic produce. The soup is usually vegan. The butternut squash is my favorite so far. \nThey also have vegan options for their salads on the menu, as well as a quinoa bowl. Everything I've tried so far has been fresh and tasty. \nYou order at the counter and they bring it out to you. They have lots of desserts but not too sure if any of them are vegan."}
{"input": "Very good breakfast. Within walking distance of our hotel. Had the crepes with fruit. Would get again for sure. Not sure about the tea. Had a hint of fennel seed to it."}
{"input": "Off the \"beaten path\" however a great breakfast spot. Very good service along with a well versed menu. The Monterey Omelette; good sized portion cooked to perfection. Scott kept our water glass & coffee cup full. The fresh fruit cup was refreshing. One of the best  breakfast restaurants & high marks all around."}
{"input": "Placed a to go order, had to repeat it multiple times over the phone and it was still wrong when I picked it up. Unfortunately I had little time and didn't have time to have it fixed. I was not offered anything but excuses and unfortunately I do not think I will be returning because of this experience."}
{"input": "I ordered delivery, food was an hour ad a half late and cold when it arrived. I was told they would be sending a free drink and dessert due to the tardiness, but those items never arrived. When I called to inquire, they said they would remake my order - though since it had been two hours since I originally ordered, I was not surprised nor did I care when that never arrived either. Food, service and punctuality were all terrible. I recommend spending your money elsewhere - this was the worst dining experience I've ever endured."}
{"input": "This is a decent place to stop at the Lakeside Mall, where pretty much everything besides Bed Bath & Beyond could be described as \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"  The stuffed grape leaves are ok and served for a fair price, although they are served cold.  The falafel are fair, but the hummus is as bland as a piece of paper drizzled with olive oil.  Skip that unless you eat it with the salad, which is actually very nicely dressed."}
{"input": "This place is quite good even though my quesadilla came without the chicken I ordered. I'm thinking it had to do with the language barrier. The chips, salsa, and cheese dip were fantastic. My mixture of sweet and unsweetened tea was just right. Also, my co-worker gave his chimichanga two thumbs-up. It's not the best Mexican ever, but better than 2/3 out there."}
{"input": "Mediocre service at best, pretty decent French food though. \n\nUpon arriving to the restaurant you are greeted by a large sign in the middle of the walkway that says \"Please seat yourself.\" I typically have no issue with places that ask you to seat yourself, in fact, I rather enjoy picking my own seat. However, I wasn't greeted by an actual person for 10 minutes after finding a seat. \n\nWhen I was finally welcomed the person brought me water and took my order for coffee which she promptly returned with then told me someone would be along shortly to take my order. \n\n...10 more minutes pass before a waiter comes to take my order. Keep in mind that the restaurant was only 50% full when I came in to eat. \n\nThe food came out promptly after ordering as a nice change of pace and was pretty good. Not the best Croque Madame I've had but certainly not the worst either. \n\nIf they improved their service I would be tempted to return."}
{"input": "Pho is awesome! More people should come here! Awesome service and the food is always wonderful."}
{"input": "Buying Guns...Yes\nGun Range... So-So\n\nI bought my 1st firearm here and the process was simple and easy. They have a decent connection to the State Police Barracks where it took me all of 3 minutes to get approval. They have a wide selection of guns. Smith and Wesson(s) are normally new and Heckler & Koch. I have never bought a used gun so I can not speak on their selection. \n\nI have shot a few rounds inside of the range with a few used rifles. They were clean and I asked them to break them down in front of me before my session. They honored that. \n\nOverall... Good shop\nRange ok."}
{"input": "My boyfriend and I are driving cross country and this hotel has been a great place to recharge. Nick at the front desk was AMAZING and went out of his way to accommodate us. Beautiful rooms, bathrooms and views! Well worth the money!"}
{"input": "Seriously. Do not, whatever you do, eat here. If you do you will be forced to enjoy arguably the best Indian on the Main Line. And you will likely overeat. \n\nSeriously, I love the Ekta in Fishtown. But this one is better. The dining room is a bit weird (it was probably once an Italian joint). But who cares. Once you taste their Butter Chicken, you wont care about anything other than whats on your fork. Then you won't listen to your stomach when it says you're full. You'll just keep eating and savoring each mouthful of tasty goodness UNTIL YOU EXPLODE!"}
{"input": "Friendly staff and the best chain pizza in Reno.  Check in on Yelp while you're there and get a free carton of ice cream."}
{"input": "We tried the veg lunch combo and it was very well made (healthy like a simple home made meal) . Also tried pastries, dil pasand , samosa (less oily) and they were good too . Overall it was a good experience ."}
{"input": "A lil cozy bar/restaurant on Frenchman Street.  Small plates, good music and service."}
{"input": "I love this place, I've found myself dreaming of their Singapore Noodles. Some of their items can be a bit over priced like their springrolls, but they are pretty reasonably priced for the most part because they give you such large portions. Even if you don't like sitting down and eating at restaurants I recommend at least getting take out from here!"}
{"input": "I love this stand so much. The flowers are so vibrant and will last much longer than the regular store bought bouquet you find in supermarket.  They have a wide variety of flowers and many ways they can be arranged. Very affordable and attention to detail. The staff are friendly and helpful. From holiday parties to life events they always have something eye catching and meaningful that can be made to leave a lasting impression."}
{"input": "Amazing presentation of food, staff and atmosphere!  Jamie, our waiter, was great!  Extremely helpful, fast and attentive.  Don't miss out this hidden gem."}
{"input": "Even after finding many great Spanish restaurants in the country (mostly NYC), Modesto is still one of my favorite Spanish place to eat.  This place is really good!  Too bad I don't live near St. Louis anymore since this is one of the places that I miss."}
{"input": "Really yummy calzones! Pretty good deal for the amount of toppings included in the calzone. Good combo of flavors too. We got the Fatty B, & Puttanesca; both were really good and a nice (pretty big!) size. Locally made sodas on tap, which was neat. I took off 1 star because their big, clean, spacious restroom didn't have a hanging table on the large empty walls. Easy fix would've made this a more frequent lunch or fast dinner option for us."}
{"input": "Fastest delivery ever! I ordered my food, went downstairs long enough to have a glass of wine and when I came back to my room they were already there with my good. The good was excellent and at a great price. I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"input": "First visit to this neighborhood gem. Sophisticated but casual. So nice to visit a restaurant where the staff genuinely care about their work and the atmosphere they create. Food was delicious. All of their salad dressings are made in house, a detail that I certainly appreciate. The service was spectacular. Will definitely be returning."}
{"input": "I absolutely love this place. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, the facilities are clean, and the whole experience makes you feel fantastic. In one week I've seen my cellulite go down.  My skin is already much more taut and I leave each time with a grin.  This PB location is well maintained, well staffed, and easy to drop into.  My only sadness is that there are no one-on-one massages.  Otherwise, the monthly parties with food and drink are fun and relaxing! The staff gives you a goal oriented regime and remember your name.  If you live nearby, you do a disservice by not trying this out."}
{"input": "Great food and service! Loved it there, will definitely be back. All their food is organic and fresh. Prices are reasonable as well. I suggest making a reservation if you are going on the weekend, they get very busy"}
{"input": "Food was good- atmosphere/decor is like a fishing lodge- menu is someplace between outback & bonefish. Went on a Groupon & all 3 of our meals & calamari appetizer that we ordered were cooked perfectly- we will def be back."}
{"input": "Dr. Biscardi is fantastic.  She was running about a half hour late but I felt as though her exam was very thorough.  She was not rushed at all & I was pleased with her skills.\n\nThis would be a 5 star review if it weren't for the front desk staff.  The receptionist made a billing error while checking me out, and then proceeded to call me several times in the 24 hours after my appointment.  It was in no way an urgent matter and I found that unprofessional."}
{"input": "Great for drinking, live music, and atmosphere.  Ok for food.  Bad for service.  \n\nWhen you order snow crab at a restaurant with a significant amount of seafood on the menu one would expect that the server wouldn't roll her eyes at you when you ask for a crab cracker and fork.  One would also expect the server to maybe stop by once or twice to check on refills....especially when you're sitting outside and it's nearly 80 degrees.\n\nI hate to judge a place on a single server but this server was one of the worst ever so the mere fact that they are keeping her on staff makes me go from 3 stars to 2 stars.  Sorry."}
{"input": "This place is just awful. Great atmosphere, but food is just plain bad. I've given it too many tries. Done."}
{"input": "Usually I would get sushi here and spend about $20. It was okay for the price and the portion was average. Today though, it tasted weird. Also, maybe it was because we got a sumo roll but it cost more than usual. I'm pretty sure that it's not about $20 for a sumo roll though."}
{"input": "This tour is highly recommended. As a local, they do give you a good taste of new orleans. From gumbo to jambalaya to a muffaletta to a poboy. Very good tour. This is my second tme taking it! Preston was an animated tour guide and very fun to be around."}
{"input": "We tried this place out because it was in the Passport program. We started out with a couple glasses of wine and a sautéed calamari. The calamari was nicely cooked and had a pretty good broth, but could have used a little salt. \n\nOur entrees were great, though. I had a lamb special, which was incredible, and my wife's pasta was also very good. \n\nA couple weird things: 1) the space is a little small, to the point where the servers are tripping over each other; 2) the music choice was strange for an Italian place (mid-90s country) - I wasn't looking for Dean Martin or anything, but it was an odd choice."}
{"input": "Went there about a month ago based on a recommendation from my in-laws..portion sizes were large I just wish the food was good.  Maybe I was expecting to much because my mother-in-law raved about the place but I'm sorry to say I was not impressed and won't be going back."}
{"input": "This is my favorite restaurant that is strictly Thai. The curry dishes are all pretty tasty, but I always go for the sudkho fried rice that has a combination of sausage, chicken, beef, and shrimp (leave the shrimp off). They cook their fried rice better than places double the price or more in town. The owner of the place is such a sweet lady and pretty much runs the joint single-handedly. I think her husband is the cook/chef and she pretty much does the rest no matter how busy it gets. It's more of a lunch place, but is open for dinner as well. If you're a fan of Thai I highly recommend you stop in and give this place a chance. You won't be disappointed."}
{"input": "I've been wanting to get my locks re-keyed since moving into our house a few months ago.  I put it off, fearful of how expensive it would be.  I finally called KEY ONE today to get a quote and hear the possibilities.  I was impressed that a live person answered the phone and could schedule me within the same afternoon.  Best of all was the level of service- the gentleman was polite and changed 5 locks very quickly.  The cost, surprisingly, was affordable."}
{"input": "I cannot say enough about the accommodations at the JW. I was working a trade show in the Grand Ballroom today and needed to pump as I am a new mom. Nathan was so quick to help as I was searching for a location that I could use. He opened up a boardroom for me to use and locked it behind me so I would not be disturbed. I know there was at least one other mom that was accommodated at the same time I was. All of the facilities, as well as the boardroom, were impeccably clean. I am so grateful for how kind and wonderful the staff was. Big kudos to the JW and the staff for making such awesome arrangements to support working moms- totally made my day!"}
{"input": "HORRIBLE!!! DONT waste your time or money! Been getting acrylics for 15 years and they are the WORST!!! Clueless woman and RUDE AF!  They cut me And made me wait and were rude to me after I waited and had lady start my nails ( while waiting for nail tech) who I know didn't even have a certificate to do nails."}
{"input": "I had my Co worker pick up a to go order. The food was all fabulous.  I thought it was pricey until I saw the quality and amount of food that you get! The coleslaw is unique and delicious! If you haven't tried this place, go! I can't wait to try the cajun meatloaf, available after 5 p.m.\nGreat job Jungle Prada Tavern Team! I will be back!"}
{"input": "If you're looking for the perfect post-beach snack, this it!\nI didn't realize how close it was to Lower State street and a little walk to the beach.\n\nTo switch things up, I ordered the Dragon Bowl which had pitaya, mangoes, kiwis, and bananas. The texture of the acai was very different. It had a glue-like texture rather than the classic icy-smoothie style. Besides the texture throwing me off, this was great! The sliced fruit was fresh and the acai wasn't so cold that it gives me a brain freeze! What really surprised me was how big the portion was. If you're not that hungry, I would recommend splitting this with someone or getting the kiddie bowl. \n\nThe acai bowls are a little more on the pricier side~ $9 but it is a filling meal. \n\nThere's free parking for the first 75 minutes in the lot across the way."}
{"input": "Great place to chill with a drink. Process time is short, and tastes are good. Excellent location."}
{"input": "Great snacks and awesome beer. AMAZING random music selection. Outside patio is a plus!"}
{"input": "Easy online ordering. Food was good. We had a cheesesteak with fried onions, mozzarella sticks, onion rings, and a pizza steak.\n\nOne thing I didn't like was that the cheese steak automatically comes with sauce. It doesn't mention this on the menu so I didn't know to order it without sauce."}
{"input": "Chill has incredible creative food combinations that are absolutely delicious! My family and I love this restaurant. The staff and owner are delightful as well."}
{"input": "My parents went here before I was born and ive been going here for years. Its my favorite sandwich shop. The service is always great and the environment is always welcoming, even if your attire doesn't necessarily fit the style of the place they treat you no different. Hot pastrami sandwich and an Icky IPA will make my day."}
{"input": "Armando was magic! We recently got married 08/29 at Bacara Resort and Armando (along with Shauna) were an integral part of our dream wedding! Armando was a pleasure to work with along the whole process and offered so much advice that was truly KEY in executing our vision. Armando worked well with us and was a true professional. He is very well known in Santa Barbara and it was always reassuring to hear that he was great to work with! His recommendations and sage advice kept us in line and on target with what we wanted. We were very particular about A LOT of aspects of the wedding and he really was amazing at negotiating and compromising with our goals in mind. Shauna and Armando really were very organized and on-point come wedding day! We couldn't have asked for a better experience! Thanks!\n\nPlus, Armando can get down on the dance floor! ;)"}
{"input": "Went to Three Muses our first night in New Orleans. The plates are tapas style, small and meant for sharing. Between the four of us we got the blue cheese stuffed dates, the crawfish egg rolls, steak and cake, lamb sliders, feta fries and fish tacos. Everything was really good,i could have done without the tacos, but the lamb sliders and the steak and cake were AMAZING. The goat cheese paired with the lamb was to die for. And the crab cake was the best I have ever had."}
{"input": "I blame these guys for my bloated tool collection, because there are only so many keys I need copied, but whenever I pass by, I just HAVE to go in to shoot the breeze with the owner and/or employees. The relevant: they somehow manage to have every single thing I've ever needed, from specialty sizes of sanding belts, electrical supplies, crazy novelty keys, extra-extra-long drill bit collars. The irrelevant: between the three guys, you will always have a great conversation about music, travel, drugs, sports, history, or politics waiting for you. A real gem!"}
{"input": "Happy hour here is great! We ordered the corn rangoons, which were a nice combination of savory and sweet, and the bulgogi dumplings, along with the happy hour cocktail special. If we had stopped there, the bill would have been $24. But the dumplings were so good we had to get another order and the cocktails were so good we had to each get (ahem) two more. And the food in general was so delicious that we wanted to try some entrees. The brisket ramen noodles were perfectly cooked and the meat was very tender. The shrimp dan dan noodles were peanutty and creamy. Service was very attentive and friendly and even with all the booze, the bill was more than reasonable. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"input": "My brother is getting married today, so our family of 5 came in for a big breakfast. The wait staff was extremely pleasant and our waitress even dropped off a complementary cinnamon roll to the table in honor of my brother's big day! The omelets were well portioned, the eggs Benedict was delicious, and the breakfast burrito was big enough for two! I highly recommend this diner!!"}
{"input": "Another massage therapist referred me to her,  and I'm so glad that she did! As a service provider myself, i have a lot of tension and muscle challenges.  Her massage was one of the most relaxing and effective massages I've ever had!  (Thing I loved the most:  she used hot rice bags to relax the muscles of my neck and back while  she massaged other areas)"}
{"input": "All of hype about Federal Donuts made me a little worried it wouldn't live up to it's reputation. But, it absolutely did. I'm a vegetarian so I can only personally comment on the donuts and coffee; however, my husband is obsessed with the chicken. His favorite is the buttermilk ranch.\n\nThe donuts are pretty amazing. Paired with an iced coffee and it doesn't get any better. The staff couldn't be nicer- even when they're busy."}
{"input": "This place is got to be the best place in Tucson.  I fell in love with it due to it's super long and nice hiking trails.  You definitely need more than a day to truly explore this beauty.  It is huge!\n\nIf I lived here, I would buy the yearly pass and night hike this place.  So peaceful.\n\nThe tram is a bit pricey... $8... yikes.\n\nI love this place!"}
{"input": "Love the courtyard and the coffee... I wanted strong coffee, and that's just what i got.  It was great.  The beignets were a little bit heavier and about $.60 more for 3 than Cafe DuMonde.  I thought the trade off in comfort and proximity was well worth it though.  The omelets looked good and the shrimp po-boy looked delicious."}
{"input": "Delicious! I got the special, fried green tomato sandwich, my husband got the deluxe, mother-in-law got french dip. We also got a bacon pizza. It was all good.  The only thing I didn't like was the pasta salad side...had too much olive flavor and I don't like olives so I guess if you like olives you may like it.  Wished I wasn't so ful as I would have liked to try the desserts."}
{"input": "Service was horrible, most food wasn't very good, spaghetti squash marinara was inedible. It took over an hour and the place was less than half full. As crappy as these awful chains can get."}
{"input": "Sitting in the pedicure chair right now starting to write this- my first time here and so far so good. Came at 6pm on a weekday and it's just me in here.. Getting a pedicure and the girl massaged each of my legs for like 5 minutes straight and THEN came out with hot stones for more- AMAZING. Also got paraffin on my heels, not sure if that's the norm, but I needed it. Oh, then as you're drying MORE massages- this time an awesome back one! YES PLEASE. Only draw backs are: there are like no magazines to be found near the pedi chairs and the music is very old school (organ and piano instrumentals??), I also love to get BRIGHT colors but they don't really have any except in gel. But hey, for the massages I just got- well worth it."}
{"input": "ABC Dentistry and Dr Singer make a visit to the dentist like going to Disney. The new set up definitely makes kids feel at ease which makes dental appointments so much easier. I would highly recommend this to any parent with a child who is terrified."}
{"input": "This place is something out of a sci-fi movie. I went in with a broken iPhone 5s screen that I needed to get replaced and I swear, when I turned around to look at phone cases, this guy must have popped out 4 more arms and used telekinetic powers to disassemble and reassemble the phone with the new iPhone screen. By the time I got done looking at phone cases on the wall (approximately 63 seconds) I turned to walk back to the counter to watch him repair my phone, but he already turned back to his normal human form with two arms and all the phone parts he had flying around with his telekinetic powers have been put away already as he was walking back to the counter to hand me the phone back. If you need a phone fixed, and fixed fast, I highly recommend going here, but I wouldn't recommend breaking your phone on purpose to try and catch a picture of the experience, by the time you get your camera out, the phone will be fixed already and he will be asking you if you want to pay by cash or credit."}
{"input": "Great beer selection. Service at the bar was a little slow."}
{"input": "I chose to dine at Ralph's for my birthday dinner and I am so glad I did! \n\nFood was deliciousssss, service was great and the interior is beautiful.\n\nI will definitely come back to try other items on the menu!"}
{"input": "So I hear whispers of a reemergence of brunch I truly believe this is the best brunch spot in New Orleans.  And they only do it once a year. Great local favors. Great service Their so called biscuits and debris should be called the \"life changing flavorgasm\" at that moment when you realize simplicity and perfection collide; dazed and confused you will awaken your senses at Carrollton market. The oyster good enough French omelet is everything I wanted in life and more. Thank you @Carrolltonmarket I am speechless. And that does not happen often"}
{"input": "I never knew this place was here.  \nA comfortable, clean environment with seating downstairs.\nI always prefer savory vs sweet so I ordered the Norwegian Crepe and it was so good and filling.  I would love to go back there and try all their other options... and maybe share a sweet one for dessert"}
{"input": "For a seafood restaurant at the edge of pear expectations should be set high. My wife and I have come here 3 times now and ordered different plates off the menu each time. This last time we ordered cioppino, clam chowder, and a crab salad sandwich;\n*Good - clam chowder (excellent flavor and consistency) would order again.\n*Not great - cioppino (lacked flavor & a variety of sea food/lack there of) would not order again\n*Pass - crab salad sandwich (lacked flavor, mayo was overpowering, crab flavor was almost non-existent, side of onion rings too greasy) - would not order again \nThe overall experience is okay, better if seated outside right on the pear overlooking the ocean, inside is very small. Service is good but be prepared to wait a bit to be seated. \nIs it worth a visit? Yes, but be selective of what you order as the menu tends to be a hit and miss."}
{"input": "Unique place to visit! Many choices on the menu....Interesting staff and friendly!  Wish they had better quality bacon.. It was thin boring bacon!  Pancakes were awesome! Good place for breakfast!  Been here for many years!"}
{"input": "Love the friendly environment and wonderful food. I just can't say enough good things about this place. Yummy scones and salads but the tea is so Divine as well. Will return for sure."}
{"input": "I took my BMW 528 in for some body work on the trunk and rear quarter panel. Although the estimate was a little higher than others, I was very impressed with the knowledge and professionalism of Jennifer and decided to go with Goldies. The repairs and paint job were outstanding and my car was ready when promised. I'd give the body work an A.\n\nI also paid for an interior and exterior detailing for $250. The air vents and dash area look brand new which is amazing since my car is a 1997. The rubber around the sunroof was missed and I learned the window hadn't been opened so there was no opportunity to see what needed to be cleaned there. Chips in the paint were touched up. Jennifer said the wax should last for 30 days which I didn't think was great. I'd give the detailing job a B."}
{"input": "Disclaimer: I'm writing this review for the common areas of the hotel, which I've experience during the past two \"Tales of the Cocktail\" events. \n\nThe rooftop pool is small but offers a truly spectacular view of the city. Lounging poolside during TOTC made me feel like I was at an exclusive party in L.A. Really nice.\n\nThe Carousel Bar is a New Orleans institution--if you have a little extra money to drop I highly suggest grabbing a drink here. If you can't find a seat on the carousel, try to snag the little two-seater table right in the front window: a people watcher's dream. \n\nLocated in the heart of the French Quarter, the Monteleone feels like a grand old dame full of luxury and secrets. If walls could talk, right? I'd love to stay here the next time I take a vacation without leaving NOLA."}
{"input": "I really liked this place for a long time when its was Steve's. Towards the end of Steve's I noticed a decline in food and service and it has continued on with the new management. I've been there three times since the re-naming and my order has never been right. One time I order over easy eggs and scrambled came out. The next time I ordered corned beef hash and sausage patties came out and the final time I ordered a 2 eggs with corned beef hash and home fries with tortillas. I got eggs with country fried steak and biscuits. By the time my order was replaced everyone at my table had finished there breakfast and had mediocre responses to the quality food. I'm not one to complain at restaurants but I will not be visiting what used to be my favorite neighborhood breakfast joint anymore."}
{"input": "We have used Reconnect to purchase 3 homes and sell 2 of them.  Steve is great to work with.  Some of the homes that we have purchased needed work done and he is great at helping visualize possibilities and he knows what is within a realistic budget of work.  You don't want to purchase a home with amazing expectations and find out that the work you were planning cost more than you could afford.  We highly recommend Steve!"}
{"input": "This was the third time I've been to this place, as it's close to my work so I've had an opportunity to try a few items on the menu.  Overall the portions that I get served are so small for the price when compared to other places in town, and the food just doesn't come off as very fresh.  Maybe it's a good place for drinks, I don't know, but I'm not too interested in a fourth visit."}
{"input": "Oh yeah, and the Deep Sea Red is rich and amazing and it smells like berries!  When they sent me a replacement it was as good as I remember and it was here the next day!"}
{"input": "The pizza was good, though a little overpriced in my opinion. The atmosphere was nice and the location convenient. I would definitely go again."}
{"input": "Order from here frequently and I am never disappointed. However, today, they even exceeded my expectations ten-fold. It is a miserable, rainy day with residual rain from Hurricane Harvey and I am not in the mood to go pick up pizza so I placed an order. They were here in record time, again with piping hot delicious pizza. I complimented the delivery driver on the promptness and he was adorable. Thank you for the wonderful service and excellent food every time I order."}
{"input": "I really loved this place! Tina did my nails, and they look fantastic. I was given no pressure to do anything. They have great prices for waxing, manicures are only $10. $48 for pedicure w gel polish. Mon-wed they do pedicures for $22 I'll be back!"}
{"input": "Just ate my second meal at this restauant.  There were four of us and    one other customer, therefore the service was above average.  The meal was very good.. We all had a pasta entree which came with soup and salad(one special salad).  There was a wide selection of desserts. Wine was average. The price was what we expected and we will go back again.  Bon Appetit"}
{"input": "Jones brunch is amazing. Went with four friends and we got the all got bottomless Bellinis which is a great deal. They let it sit there for 2 hours while we drank as much as we could. The mac and cheese is to die for. Monkey bread is a great appetizer for the table. Chicken and Waffles was really good. Chicken was moist and and the skin was gently fried. The syrup was nice and sweet. The Ambiance was great. We have reservations and we were seated right away.This place is vegetarian-friendly. The server was friendly. Only thing I regret is not trying their dessert."}
{"input": "Bottomless mimosas, sangrias,  and bloody Mary's for $15 at Sunday Brunch. Expect a wait. The crawfish beignet was delicious... flaky bread stuffed with crawfish and cheese, topped with jalapeño aioli. Yum."}
{"input": "Owner and team are amazing and takes pride in their work!!!"}
{"input": "The service and ambience are great, the food was fine. We ordered the nachos and the chicken grinder. Nachos were good (although I will NEVER understand why Boise puts olives on nachos). The grinder had a spicy sauce I didn't like but the husband did. The chicken on both was good. Very attentive servers, we went on an afternoon and they were extremely welcoming to our small kid. We really liked the decor of the place and the bar is huge. Husband had the Locomotive Dry Stout and was happy. They have some limited outdoor seating and offer four for $4 beer flights. Glad to have this place on the west side of town, definitely a good addition to the fairgrounds area."}
{"input": "This place was dead as a doornail for midweek lunch, and it shouldn't be.  It's sheik, trendy, has tv's, a bar, and my waitress was very nice.  I had the steak sandwich with sauteed vegetables, and the vegetables were probably the best I've had in Nashville.  The $8 sandwich was awesome, too."}
{"input": "The service was good.  The ingredients were fresh.  Nice and noisy like a kid friendly family place should be.\n\nPlenty of options for your burrito, enough so that my daughter and I could build a burrito to each of our satisfactions.  This feat in itself is no small accomplishment.  I'll be back."}
{"input": "Food was excellent!\nHostess Robin was delightful \nSantino our wait person was super"}
{"input": "This place is my absolute fave! The flavors are spot on, they taste exactly the way you imagine, but better! The strawberries & champagne, toasted marshmallow, and cheesecake  are a few of my personal favorites. I moved to Phoenix a few years back and was ecstatic when I found out they opened locations in the valley. This is a Tucson gem that I will continue to visit over and over!"}
{"input": "This culvers is always busy, and hasn't gotten an order wrong yet. Its pretty good, like the same as any other good culvers. The service is nice too, I think they might leave their cheese curds out too long- not always fresh. But I'd reccommend."}
{"input": "Had to check out this spot seen on every YouTube vlog ever. Luckily for us, our Airbnb was only 2 blocks away!\n\nWhen you walk inside, you can purchase bottles of wine and cheese to enjoy outside. If you'd like to try their tapas, head outside and order at the window. There's also a bar serving other drinks upstairs.\n\nThey have live music every night at 7:30pm. We went around 9pm and enjoyed a selection of tapas and their risotto. I was very fond of their pickled veggies and patatas bravas.\n\nGreat food, great prices, great hangs for a perfect evening."}
{"input": "Sat down over a half hour, only miso and drinks served. Waiting for actual food ordered or someone to cook it ....waiting ..."}
{"input": "Excellent dentist, caring person, wonderful staff.  No waiting. Free street parking, never had a problem finding within a block or so in this South Philly neighborhood.  An artist whose work adorns the office and a similarly skilled artist when mending/replacing teeth! (A Michaelangelo for the mouth.)  \n\nGreat pre-chemo checkup and care (you can't go to dentist during chemo because it crushes your immune system).  Proactively wrote prescription for mouth rinse (for dry mouth or thrush) that might be needed due to chemo reaction.  Fortunately, I only needed the over the counter alternative he also recommended, Biotene.\n\nStaff seems to remember every detail about people and their issues -- caring, lovely, helpful.\n\nIs it possible to actually look forward to going to the dentist?  Dr Stern has created a dental oasis.\n\nIn my experience, accepts dental insurance reimbursement as payment in full.  Others charge hundreds more and quality not even as good."}
{"input": "I can't speak for the previous person's server but mine was pleasant....both to interact with and on the eyes (yes I am female) she was paitent with me as I gingerly gazed at the menu. She suggestes the combo since I couldn't shake the falafell calling but wanted some meat. Picked chicken and beef, and the beef was the winner. Falafell is a staple of middle eastern food and not all good places make good balls. THESE DID NOT DISAPPOINT. Crunchy and not over fried, I had a huge bowl of humus and baba to baste on. The tumeric in their homemade yogurt is so light and smooth it almost wants me to have another STL trip to come and eat a shwarma sandwich mid day!  Don't let the set back strip mall suprise you. Leave the inhabitions at the door wear elastic pants and get ready for dinner and a show. OBTW I passed on the hooka"}
{"input": "I can't say enough about Ice Cream 504!! The only bad thing is it's with in walking distance and we're finding ourselves walking everyday to get some amazing homemade ice cream!! The flavors are spot on!  I'd add a picture but it's always eaten before I get a chance! A must stop if your in the area!!"}
{"input": "I'm from Trenton NJ so I would call myself a Pizza enthusiast.  I have tried the Quattro Formaggi and it is great however tonight I tried the Veal Parm Sandwich and it is sinfully good. The Bread is Pizza dough bread and the Veal and cheese to sauce ratio was perfect I literally just finished it and had to write a review based on that. This and the other Pizza place that starts with a N are both top notch. Coming from a guy who grew up with delorenzo's and papa's pizza his whole life."}
{"input": "Really good grilled/BBQ food...but not worth the price they put on it. One meat plus two sides is almost $11. The serving of meat is sort of big, just not $10 worth. It is tasty though, and I would recommend it if you don't mind paying a few extra dollars (which I assume many South Tampa-ites don't). I like that they have Coca-Cola products with real sugar...the kind you get from Mexico ;-) Oh and try the banana pudding...it's pretty good!"}
{"input": "Being a vegetarian while visiting New Orleans is no easy feat.  However, when I have found eats, they are usually very good.  Tomasito's was below the standard I have gotten used to.  Not to say it was bad, not at all.  I had the chips and a bean and cheese burrito. I would have gotten rice in my burrito but it was not vegetarian (really?).  Service was ok, and the flan was excellent (although \"with berries\" seems to mean one raspberry).\nThat being said, at least there was food to eat on the menu, and that is not assumes in New Orleans."}
{"input": "The customer service was horrible. I called to place an order for pick up. The kids menu was not posted online so I asked the lady who answered for the kids menu. She proceeded to tell me that she was too busy to tell me and placed me on hold. However, she didn't realize that I could still hear her. She proceeded to complain that someone was on the phone asking her to read the entire menu and she didn't have time. I told her to cancel the order and I drove up there. When I got there and asked to speak to a manager, I discovered that the person who answered the phone was the manager. I have never experienced such rude and unprofessional customer service. RUDE RUDE RUDE!"}
{"input": "The food tastes great but portions are small. First, we ordered fried calamari, which is always a shareable appetizer. It was s portion meant for one person. For my main coarse I ordered Surf & Turf. ( $38.00 ) I asked the waiter if the amount of filet mignon medallions would be sufficient...He said \" yes, it's s big portion\".  I received two small medallions, each being bite size. The lobster was also small but I expected that. When I brought my dissatisfaction to the waiters attention , he agreed that there should have been more and apologized. That was it ! Nothing was done to rectify the extremely small portion. Thankfully, I was able to fill up on the steak fries. For the price I paid, I should not have left hungry. So, if you have s small appetite, this is the place for you."}
{"input": "Good donuts. There was a small selection but it was late afternoon when I came so I don't blame them. Extremely nice staff."}
{"input": "If you're looking for a great happy hour then this is your spot! Their happy hour menu has many choices for drinks and appetizers. My mom and I frequently go to On The Border for margaritas because they are delicious! If you go during the summer, you must try the watermelon margarita. :-) the only complaint I have ever had here is their service. On The Border is frequently getting new employees who aren't always as attentive as you'd like your service to be. It is common to wait long periods of time for your bill or even need a refill for chips and a drink."}
{"input": "This place is beautiful.  Most Kimpton properties I've stayed at have been.  They always have unique interior design and at this hotel, the design was noticeable. From the carpets to the chairs and colors in the room.  Really well done.  I guess that's one of my things whenever I stay somewhere. It's always the little stuff that you notice that makes you say \"that's nice\"... and this hotel had a lot of those little things.\n\nFrom the exterior.. entrance..the lobby... elevators.. and of course, when you walk in the room.  (And of course the bed) If you're not disappointed in any way at any of those points.. you've got yourself a great hotel. \n\nIt's also larger than other Kimpton properties that I've stayed at, (in Washington D.C.) which was nice.  \n\nIt's right in the heart of the city, and a great place to stay. Highly recommend it."}
{"input": "It's been a while since I've been back to this chili's location. I had a bad experience with the service my previous visit. After almost a year, I figured I'd give it another try. That was my mistake. I was in a party of two. There was no line at the door so we walked in and sat on the bar side, after being greeted by a rather confused hostess. It took a long time for our waitress to take our drink orders. We ordered our appetizer which came with barely any sauce. There were two other parties that sat down after us but got their food first. When our food came out my fajitas were colder than normal. Usually they would be smoking which I was able to compare to the person's order to the table beside us. Our waitress was all over the place with her tables and was not tentative even though it wasn't that busy. I will not return to this chili's."}
{"input": "It has been quite awhile since I have been to this Silver Peak, but I was pleasantly surprised.  a group of 4 of us went for lunch after a movie.  We were able to get a seat on the patio.  Our waitress was very attentive, even coming back at one point to tell us our food was on its way.  I had the turkey sandwich, which had great flavor.  Overall, I would still avoid The Peak during late nights (just because it's not really my scene - and even less so as I realize I'm getting older!), but it's great for lunch and a week night dinner."}

{"input": "We were in Philadelphia for one night and were really craving Spanish food!  We found this place and were immediately excited.  No one was in the restaurant which made us a bit skeptical at first, but later we realized it's because most people get takeout!  This place has so much variety and gives huge portions.  I got a skirt steak with yellow rice and it was fantastic.  My friend got Chicken and Shrimp in a garlic sauce.  We both enjoyed our food very much and it was very reasonably priced.  We ended the meal by sharing a piece of tres leches cake (which was fantastic) and coffee.  The coffee cups were  a little small but it did the trick.\n\nThis is a great low key place with great food.\n\nI will definitely be back when in the area and I would highly recommend!"}
{"input": "I loves me some seitan, and that's why I keep going to El Camino. The seitan wings & seitan nachos are so good! Unfortunately, the service is not. It can be extremely slow. On one occasion it took them so long to get my seitan nachos out to me that they had to give them to me on the house. All of my friends were done eating and ready to leave and I was JUST getting my food! \n\nAs for the rest of the food at El Camino, the only other thing I've tried would be the fried pickles. I have to say, I was not impressed. I love both pickles and fried things but these were not good. The coating was too grainy and I just didn't like the taste. \n\nThe seitan is so good that it keeps me coming back. And the margaritas are pretty good too."}
{"input": "Listen up, this is a good buffet - a buffet - Chinese Buffet.  Those words can mean a lot of things to people.\nPros: Broccoli and green beans are good and always on the menu.  Get your veggies people, thin noodles - mai fun, and chicken broccoli.  They always have FRESH fruit.  I go there to eat a decent meal and they deliver.\nCons: It's a buffet. The food can sit for a while and get old and the variety over time is not the best.\nFood 3.5/5\nValue 5/5\nService 3/5\nAtmosphere 2/5"}
{"input": "Outstanding food and service. The only challenge was that one plate came late so we didn't get to eat together. Overall though a great experience and we will be back!\n\nMy wife and I had breakfast combo number one and it was awesome. A lot of food!!!\n\nMy son had steak fajitas and he really enjoyed it. \n\nCan't wait to come back"}
{"input": "Great little reward for a great end of the week. Only problem is seating. No outside seating because it's cold outside, but the tasty treats make up for that. The southern carmel cake is my favorite."}
{"input": "The ambience and decor were nice. The nachos were good, along with a few choice options. However, do not order a cheeseburger. It is not only tiny, but it looks like something that was dropped off the back of a McDonald's truck as it was driving through a bad neighborhood. It was over cooked, dry, and just plain nasty. I was very disappointed to find such a flop in a restaurant that seems to be filled with blockbusters. The overall experience was fine, but that burger sure did ruin it.  The fries were another disappointment all their own."}
{"input": "Visiting SB from the Midwest and after a long day in wine country, our host treated us to carry out Pizza Mizza.  All pies were tasty, but my favorite was the one with chicken, mushroom, and rosemary white sauce.  Not a combination I would have come up with, but they're the creative people.  Yum."}
{"input": "Have to disagree with rave reviews on this one. We were shown a menu and then told they only had about half of the items. Then picked something and were told they didn't have that either. Ended up ordering chicken, lamb, and beef. It took about twenty or twenty five minutes. We ate outside because the interior is so dreary and stuffy. Our order was correct. Food was acceptable but not anything I'll go back for."}
{"input": "This place was awesome!! Fast service and nice people, what more can you ask for?! You get to do your order on a touch screen so there's no confusion and it's not too bad on price. I built my own pasta and it was amazing. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"input": "This food is to die for!  My family and I love to go here no matter the occasion.\n\nOur favorite dish is the chicken parmigiana, which is unbelievably delicious.  The portions are plentiful for the price, you will almost certainly get two meals out of it.  The vodka sauce is excellent and matched by their red sauce.  Their pasta is always perfect.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn't mention the freshly baked rolls, which really stand out on their own (we must ALWAYS bring a bag home to have with the leftovers), and bruschetta which whets the appetite before every dinner.\n\nEvery meal here is exceptional. The servers are great. Go here if you are hungry for Italian and you will never be disappointed."}
{"input": "The longest continually run business in Moorestown claims the owners. A nice little deli and butcher shop on Main Street. There's a few tables so you can sit down if you want to eat in. A nice deli for sandwiches. High quality butcher section as well in case you are looking for steaks or handcut bacon. Homemade soups, take out frozen section, salads,\nAnd chips. They go above and beyond with items like the softshell crab sandwich.\nI didn't care for the bread they use but it will be a personal preference since my girl loves it. It's more a French soft bread than and Italian loaf, so it's up to you. Still good sandwiches."}
{"input": "Service sucks big time and the manager is downright nasty, but I must say their soups and coffee are good"}
{"input": "This restaurant was an unexpected positive surprise on a visit to St. Pete. \n\nThey were quite busy and I can see why. Great specials, affordable prices, and a wide menu with tons of variety. \n\nI gave this four stars because the wait for the food was longer than expected, even with taking the busy atmosphere into consideration."}
{"input": "I am a huge seafood fan, my husband not so much, but he loves me so he knew I had to get in one seafood fix while we were in SB. I found this place on yelp and it got the highest rating on the pier. I ordered the local rock crab special and it was great! Good soup, excellent fresh side salad with great ranch dressing and the crab plate was huge, plenty of crab for one person. They had great service, beautiful location (it literally sits out on the end of the pier with outdoor seating). The only reason I give this four stars is there was nothing on the menu that did not have seafood. My poor husband got the side salad and we had to go somewhere else to get him food. I guess that's what he gets for being picky."}
{"input": "Great sushi at a fried food place?\n\nOh yeah!  I regret that we only ordered the spicy tuna roll but I made a mental note for next time.  More sushi less fried foods.  I ordered the fried grouper basket with the sushi.  Everything was good.  The baskets come with fries and it was more than enough food.  It didn't take long for the food to come out.\n\nThe service was great.  We come out to this area to the Nashville Running Company frequently so I'm sure we will be back here often."}
{"input": "Excellent Malaysian Chinese cuisine. All entrees were excellent and served piping hot. Servers were very friendly and highly efficient. My wife and I had just visited the real Penang in Malaysia and this restaurant serves authentic dishes of the same quality. \n\nEspecially recommend the roti pancakes and the various noodle dishes. Best of all, prices are very reasonable for such a great meal."}
{"input": "Went here for a late dinner (probably 7:15) and it was our first time at any Las Palmas. The parking lot was full but we were seated immediately and informed it was happy hour til 8 and that meant half price margaritas! Amazing! Most happy hours end at like 6 which is impossible to make! We enjoyed chips, salsa, and generous sized margaritas. They weren't the best I've ever had but they were strong and who cares at that price! Food didn't take long after we ordered. My husband got some sort of chicken tacos and he liked them and I got a fajita quesadilla and it was so good. Stuffed full of contents just how I like it! It would be nice if it came with like rice on the side too but I liked it just the same. The best part was our waitress was just the sweetest girl ever. I didn't get her name but she got a good tip and we will be coming back for sure!"}
{"input": "Co-workers and I placed a big order. The meal in particular was an apple cinnamon pancake with eggs and bacon for $9.99. When made thr fool mistake of trusting that everything was going to be correct with the order and when we finally opened the bag at work in that order was the pancake.. Can you imagine spending $10 on 1 pancake?? Well I called this establishment the following morning because they close at 2:30 and was instantly bombarded with negativity and rudeness from the lady who answered who placed blame on everyone else and then said JUST COME GET THE EGGS AND BACON... The rudest I've encountered in a while."}
{"input": "The wings are so meaty and juicy. Always friendly, courteous and prompt. The beer was ice cold. Perfect dinner."}
{"input": "Not a fan. Italian food is pretty straight forward. I get trying to come up with something new but this was a swing and a miss. Portions were not what you would expect at an Italian restaurant. If you are looking for a more traditional place, this isn't it. Seems more of a hipster hangout. Place was clean. Waitress hardly came around. Seemed more interested in talking to the other wait staff as the place was not busy. Won't be going back."}
{"input": "Pretty good americanized Italian. The food is ok, but $12 for a plate of spagetti with meat sauce? Considering I can go across the street and eat better Italian for comparable money? Oh and the beef ribs are terrible. Pork ribs are excellent. Strange. The salad bar was ok but way more expensive than I'd consider reasonable."}
{"input": "Charming store with incredible section of loose leaf teas and all sorts of loose leaf tea pots and accessories. Lovely bar to sit and enjoy as well as outdoor seating. Staff were incredibly helpful and friendly and the tea is the best cuppa I've ever had!"}
{"input": "It's a young start up company. Patience is a virtue.\nMany in the gun community lack this virtue, so be it.\nOwner seems to be a stand up guy and has stood by his word in my dealings with him.\nI met the owner, Jacob, at a gun show in Las Vegas where I purchased a Cerakoted billet lower.\nPretty quality work on the machining and Cerakote job.\nTraded emails with the owner and always got a quick response with the information I requested."}
{"input": "I typically do my laundry at my boyfriend's house, but I had family who recently stayed with me and had a bunch of towels, sheets, and comforters to wash.  I was searching for a laundry mat that would be safe, clean and not full of questionable people.  I was so happy to find this facility.  It is clean, well-lit, and the staff is so friendly and helpful.  I was amazed at the speed of the laundry and dryer.  I completed 4 oversize loads ( probably equal to 8 regular loads) in just under 2 hours!\n\nThis place has security cameras, flat screen T.V's, magazines, wi-fi, clean bathrooms, vending machines.  It is a wonderful atmosphere to do your laundry.  It was not overly busy, there are plenty of washers and dryers.  I am so happy that I found this place.  Thank you LAUNDROMAT!!!"}
{"input": "Went above and beyond the traditional hotel! Free shuttle within 3 miles of hotel, complimentary drink tickets for the bar, complimentary hot chocolate bar on cold days, comfortable & clean beds with comfy pillows as well. Will definitely be staying again."}
{"input": "The location is ideal, being right next to Jackson Square. There are lots of tables so being seated happened right away for even our party of 6. The service was good. All of our entrees were fine, just average. No one complained but no one was raving either. My cajun pasta was tasty with a kick but not amazing. However, the blackened alligator appetizer was really fantastic and tasted so good, I considered giving a 4 star for that dish. I definitely recommend the alligator."}
{"input": "Hands down, my favorite restaurant in Nashville. The menu is always changing, so there is always something new to try every time I come back!\n\nNot only are the dishes unique and intriguing, but they are executed perfectly every time. I've brought so many guests here when they come to visit and everyone always raves about it. We always include an order of whipped feta with our meal, which never disappoints. \n\nThe service can be a bit hit or miss at times, but even still, the food makes up for it!\n\nIf you're visiting Nashville, I recommend trying this place out instead of some of the other more popular tourist spots. If you live in Nashville and haven't yet come here, then make a reservation and try it out soon!"}
{"input": "My family LOVES Frost.  This is the only place we go when we want a cool treat!  Love every flavor that we've gotten. My favorites are dark chocolate and salted carmel!"}
{"input": "I pretty much never write a review but I have been using this Panera for almost two years now. Not consistently but a couple times a month and the staff/service is always excellent. Everything is always fresh and my order is correct. They do a great job making a large company feel like a mom and pop shop. Not to mention Panera has the absolutely best bagels ever."}
{"input": "Provi is such a wonderful person I came here because of her. The chipotle chicken avocado sandwich and chicken noodle soup is just to die for."}
{"input": "I had the pleasure to meet with Ann today and not only was she extremely helpful and so positive, she went above and beyond to make my 1st experience here amazing and made it a absolute regular customer from this day forward. Thanks girlie!!"}
{"input": "Greatest hash browns ever!  Get a slice I pepper jack on them!   Good coffee!  Eggs florentine is mind blowing too!  Fast and friendly service!"}
{"input": "We had a great meal after a day at the beach. The chicken tacos were great and my husband and so loved crab legs and oysters."}
{"input": "So I'm still not sure how I feel about Mac's Tavern, I've been here like 3 times, and I've had the food. and drinks. and had good service once, shitty awful service once and okay service once. What does this mean? well I don't know. I enjoy their fries and they have a decent beer list. But when a waitress ignores me and there are literally 2 other patrons in the bar- we have something wrong here. \n\nI will definitely give it a try in the future, but it certainly has major competition what with so many always winning bars in olde city."}
{"input": "My kitty and I love this sushi place!! We love the ratio of fish to rice. Some people have commented on the size of the rolls being small but we like not having the rice \"filler\" wrapped around the outside. And order the Las Vegas roll ... It's the best one in town! I even order one to go for Mr. pockets! The family that owes it is as cute as the place! The Eastside needs not go any further for awesome sushi!"}
{"input": "This is a must stop for every trip to New Orleans. About 2 miles from the airport.   Fresh, fresh, fresh shrimp and oysters.  It's is outside the NOLA area and the prices reflect it!   Try it once and you will be hooked"}
{"input": "I come here once in awhile to check out their clearance stuff in electronics.. and I did find a portable charger for my iphone 4 for only $22 !!  which was a deal considering that elseware it sells for $70!!"}
{"input": "Fair Wheel Bikes is likely the most knowlegable road bike pro shops in the country.   \n\nWhatever is unique, super-light, ultra-trick, and exotic, fairwheel has the skinny and means to acquire it.\n\nWay beyond the typical realm of bike shops, these guys are unique in every way.  These guys do business worldwide for a good reason."}
{"input": "Immaculate work. They fixed issues that didnt even relate to  the damage from my accident. the rubber lining on my rear window, my arm rest in the car was broken, all the scratches on the door handles were gone. 5 star would come back."}
{"input": "Awesome \"Fresh\" ingredients, good service, and a solid menu. Can't go wrong, it's a great addition to SoHo."}
{"input": "Coorie was such a pleasure here! Had so much fun wine tasting with my girlfriends and she made the experience very enjoyable. Nice atmosphere and decent selection of wine."}
{"input": "First place I ate in the area and it was sooo good. My friend and I both ordered pasta, but the pizzas looked good from afar. They have beer and wine available which is great when you don't have time for byob."}
{"input": "Came in to order coctel de camaron my food had no avocado no cilantro asked the waiter as to why it did not have it they said they were out of avocado and did not know why it had no cilantro. Just said ,I can take the plate back poor customer service it seemed like they didn't care. Very disappointing, how can a restaurant not have avocado and what's worst nobody seemed to care. I was so eager to eat this establish food now am just leaving wothout eating nothing."}
{"input": "I shop here on the regular. Good quality authentic product. Im first generation and brought up on home made polish food. Thanks Czerw's for the taste of home!"}
{"input": "It was okay. The atmosphere is very cute and inviting and our service was great. It was a Sunday so I know they were very busy in the kitchen but the food was barely warm and sub par for the price. Like I said, not bad and it's cute but the wait was long and food was fine but nothing to rave about."}
{"input": "This place has went down hill to me. At first, when it was just the owner at the one store on linbergh, the food was amazing. It seems since he started branching out, the service and food has not been up to par. I think they lost my service."}
{"input": "I just got my sidewalk replaced by this company! They did a great job! I am thankful for all they have done for me!"}
{"input": "When you combine (Ambiance, Service, & Food) ~ Kimberton Inn has the Best Sunday Brunch in the area!  Reservations are highly recommended! ~CD"}
{"input": "So meijer is amazing and so convenient! However, the starbucks is always a hit or miss and the employees don't seem to be trained right because I've noticed every time they have to pull a sheet out to see how much it is and its never the same price.. my drink wasn't good at all this morning and when i told the lady it didn't look right she poured some of my drink out and just put more milk in it to make it taste better. Wasn't really wanting to pay $4 for a cup full of milk but she didn't seem to care so why bother even saying anything.. :/"}
{"input": "I didn't enjoy my experience at Clayton nails today 7/3/2015. It was all because of the nail tech, i didn't get her name but she was young, Vietnamese with a med length bob haircut. I went in for a gel color polish change. Her work is not as neat as what im use to there. She for some reason placed two scolding hot towels over each of my hands while removing the old color. I told her that the towels were too hot and she than removed them and swung them in the air to cool off than reapplied. She than asked 'is this better princess \".  Than she turned around and ask if that woke me up. I've had a gel polish color change several times before, no one has ever placed hot towels on my hands EVER,  i don't know why she did. After the gel color polish was applied and dry she repeatedly reapplied a top thick coat over and over. I kept having to place my hands under the uv light again, thats never happened before either. I guess i have to pick one person to go to and stick to them religiously."}
{"input": "Excellent! Arrived at 5 to avoid any wait. Service was great. Food on point! House salad is a favorite."}
{"input": "Mary is the best!! She is very,very knowledgeable in conditions and is a master herbalist!! i love all the extra services too!!"}
{"input": "Hit this place frequently as i ditch the cafeteria at work & head to Microsoft ( dont need to be an employee). Great thing is you can order 1/2 portions - yup 1/2 the price too!  Food is top quality & well priced"}
{"input": "Great food. Definitely will continue to go there. Actually about to order from there today. Grilled cheesesteak was great but my Gf had the steak and shrimp quesadilla that was huge and real good."}
{"input": "I got the meatballs with a creamy mushroom sauce  The meatballs themselves were good but the sauce was a little salty. My boyfriend got the German noodles with German cheese which was pretty much Mac and cheese.  Veronica wasn't there so the atmosphere was pretty quiet but the two guys serving tonight were really sweet and had good suggestions for food."}
{"input": "Make sure you ask how each item is made before you order it  For example, the mashed potatoes are mixed with cheese - a congealed goopy mess. I  plan to go back and try again, probably breakfast, but first impression was not good."}
{"input": "This is the best pizza in Broomall. The staff is great - especially Alfredo who, no matter how busy he is, always has a kind word for his customers. For the purists the plain pizza is unbeatable in the area, if you like to try all types of funky junk on your 'za - that's great here too - especially the BBQ chicken. \nThey even make a great stromboli here which is a rarity in Delco pizza shops. Personally I like to make stromboli's myself at home, and when I do I go to Alfredo's for the dough. \n\nAlfrerdo's. The best. Eat it."}
{"input": "We had several quotes, with Pete and Ron's being the best of those I considered reputable. When i told Arbour Bay I was going with Pete and Ron they told me I would be in good hands. Had 2 very large oaks, one inaccessible from the front yard, one less than 2 feet from my roof edge taken down with a crane. I left for work in the A.M. and when I got home at 4 the trees were gone. Minimal damage from the heavy equipment in my yard. Will definitely recommend to friends and neighbors."}
{"input": "I was eager to start out my weekend on some healthy food and when Yelp recommended Bibimbap at Bab Cafe within walking distance from my hotel I thought it was a great idea... unfortunately even with it not being busy the service was slow and when it came the left off half of our order. They were however kind about it. The dishes were a bit over sauced but the Miso Soup hit the spot perfectly!!! They seem to do a great deal of take out business and Uber eats and I think that eats into the order process of those dining in unfortunately. So grabbing to might be best."}
{"input": "I absolutely love this place!\n\nGreat hours, impeccably clean, so relaxing."}
{"input": "Excellent Meal - I had the pork chop and I think may have been best I have ever had. Delicious mustard sauce and cabbage. Very nice old fashions as well.  Another to add to the STL list of eateries on my travels here!  Do not miss this dish"}
{"input": "I've been here a few times for different items. A few months ago I was here looking at appliances for my new kitchen, and while they had a nice selection, they seemed a little overpriced for what I was in the market for (I don't need a refrigerator with a camera in it). Then I was looking for a new TV, and again I found the prices to be a little much. This is a good place to shop if you are in the market for cell phones, music, movies and things of that nature, because they have a wide selection.\n\nLike others, I have utilized the recycling center and have brought old laptop batteries and other computer parts to be recycled, which is very convenient. Also, if you have an electronic thing that needs to be repaired, they will recommend someone, if they can't do it themselves which is pretty neat."}
{"input": "First time turkey meal buyer. Absolutely disgusted. The turkey was raw when it was supposed to be fully cooked. Bloody n slimey and plain disgusting. Ruined Thanksgiving and can never get that day back. \nBest advice:  DO NOT BUY!!"}
{"input": "Smells like something burnt in here. Full Montegu sandwich was good, but I am used to bigger sandwich at this price.  Nothing to really impress me here.  I won't want to come back any time soon voluntarily. However, I've been told the Thanksgiving sandwich is memorable."}
{"input": "I must say I'm very disappointed, my two stars are for presentation and prompt delivery. I ordered the rainbow roll, white tuna roll, calamari and chicken lettuce wraps. Where do I begin? ok with the bad. \n\nI strongly feel that when you are delivering food that should be served cold, you don't put it in a bag with hot food because that equals mushy, warm sushi, which is what I got. The rainbow roll, which normally is topped with raw fish was topped with mushy avocado????? which I ended up peeling off to salvage the sushi. The spicy white tuna roll was very good.\n\nThe calamari looked like chicken fingers all the breading was falling off and it was under cooked, I took one bite and tossed it. Now I've had lettuce wraps before but mines came with an actual head of lettuce in a bag and chicken filling in a plate. It was not described this way in the menu at all. All in all I don't think I'll be ordering from here again. I'll stick to Niji's on 5th."}
{"input": "I've stopped here a few times for papers and small stuff. Their location is convenient, but the staff is rude and the items are very over priced. I go to Frolic for any substantial purchases, it's worth the extra drive."}
{"input": "Our new favorite breakfast place! So glad we decided to try Brunchies. Went there for breakfast on Labor Day and we were impressed with the variety and selections on the menu. We were seated within 10 minutes when the place looked very busy. It looks like they work hard at getting you seated as soon as possible. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was nice. I ordered the Belgian waffle with strawberries and my husband ordered the Brunchies club which was so large, he brought half of it home. I love how they leave a carafe of coffee at the table. Our food was tasty and we will definitely go back soon. It's great have another 4 or 5-star restaurant in the area."}
{"input": "We showed up with a group of 30 on Saturday night and they could not have been nicer. They let us rearrange some tables for our group. The drinks were cold and strong. The food was fried to perfection. Definitely a bit of a dive bar. I read the review where the the guy was ordering martinis and laughed out loud."}
{"input": "Stopped in to beat the morning heat and grab an iced coffee. 10 seconds inside and you could tell this is wear the locals go to meet up and enjoy great coffee and a bite to eat. I can't speak to the food but the coffee was excellent and the service left nothing to want."}
{"input": "We went here and got the Cuban sandwich, it was really good. The employee ( I think the owner) was friendly. I'm not sure about all the other reviews on here. We will be going back to try the bagels."}
{"input": "So it's an old club and I think it still maybe a club at night but me and my family including our 5 year old went there for dinner! The food was good we received a sashimi plate and was very pleased with it. My some received a burger and fries which he ate and was happy with. But my biggest complaint is the SERVICE it was horrible. I had to get my own plates, sauce bowls and napkins, they bought out two glasses but didn't bring my son one. I had to request one for him, I don't know maybe they thought he was invisible. I had a groupon certificate so it was a good dinner I would come back if someone was treating."}
{"input": "Brian helped me out with my car. I have a prepaid plan which makes the paper work go fast. He was helpful with the questions I had. Also Juan the tech talked me told me some suggestions for what I had asked him. Great team good service."}
{"input": "Yes, Remedy is home to my favourite chai, has conveniently late hours, and some mean vegan selections... but that's about it. \n\nThis joint is crowded, too loud to make conversation, always has a dirty bathroom, and there's nothing too particularly endearing and homie about it.\n\nAlso a little over-done with people out on first dates, which is indeed hilarious for people-watching."}
{"input": "I go to this casino very often and for long time now..\nI'm very upset I need to pay $10 every time I go there for parking.. it used to be free and it should be free, for a place like that, that profits really nicely... it should definitely be complementary.\nI understand that now they have construction expenses, but that will also bring more people and the casino will keep profiting even more than before.\nIf not a complimentary parking for all, at least for locals!\nBesides that I would want to see healthier food options, organic at least for how pricy they are, but vegan options would be much better for everyone, and not only food that makes heart disease and cancer. Besides that the casino is clean, professional, and lots of fun!"}
{"input": "We are in the middle of a coast to coast road trip, and spent a long day in St. Louis with 3 small kids, so I was grateful to find this place on Yelp.  It was near our hotel, and was a perfect mix of tasty food and kid-friendly in a grown-up environment. Saw lots of couples on dates as well. \n\nThe full-sized power salad was huge and tasty, kids' chicken strips were made from real white meat chicken (and were delicious), and the burgers were amazing. Fries and sides were creative. Service was prompt, friendly, and very welcome after a hot, exhausting day. Ice cream was home-made and creamy. \n\nPerfect!"}
{"input": "Great company!!!  I called and they were able to come out same day to change 4 locks at our house.  They were professional, fast and very accomodating.  I had an issue with one of the lock alignments and they immediately sanded it down and fixed it.\nOverall great experience and highly recommend!"}
{"input": "Is a great place to get a great organic smoothie, BUT my last time I was there they had music playing that had a lot of f bombs in it. Sadly as a father of young children, I will not be returning there."}
{"input": "Wonderfully fresh sushi, amazing lobster fried rice with tons of umami, beautiful looking restaurant."}
{"input": "Been going since opening.  Beer is amazing, great quality, better taste!  Food trucks too.  Enough said."}
{"input": "Just awesome! My orange chicken actually had orange peels sautéed with the food! Never seen that before. Will definitely go again"}
{"input": "I ordered the Humus and Falafels and was good. The Falafels were one point with good texture, the Humus was great but I would have requested less olive oil. I will be going back next time I'm in the area."}
{"input": "Hands down the worst chicken and rice plate I've ever had. When I ordered I was told there was no sauce on the chicken (as I wanted, healthy). I ordered to go, by the time I reached the car the bag was full of oil spilling out of the container. There was easily 5-7 tablespoons of oil on the dish. Not what I was told and not what anyone would ever want to eat. Horrible.   Their slogan even has the word healthy in it. What a joke."}
{"input": "Don't let the shopping center location deter you! Amazing place and even a more amazing staff. Curtis is the true epitome of great service. Loves his job and wants nothing more than for you to enjoy your dining experience. Try the scallops small plate, you won't regret it, but the whole dining experience is top notch."}
{"input": "Decent, centrally located hotel but hurt by thin walls and poor attention to detail by the housekeeping staff."}
{"input": "What a hidden gem of a restaurant.  While everyone else go to Taco Bus and stands in long lines I'll come here to Taco Son and get just as good of food without the lines. Everything here is made from scratch and you can taste the freshness of the ingredients.  The portions are big so you get your monies worth. Oh and their breakfast burritos are killer grab you one after a long night."}
{"input": "I have been several times and it has been adequate. The last two times I have been there it has been TERRIBLE. The portions have diminished and the quality of the dishes have followed suit. I mean to a detrimental degree. I would not recommended dining here."}
{"input": "I love Bing's boba!!!!!!!!! The Taro snow is my go to drink. Definitely the best boba spot in Tucson! The place is always clean. They have board games for you to play. The staff is helpful and friendly. My husband ordered a drink that unfortunately was not at the right flavor level. He told the staff and they made him a new drink that was to his liking."}
{"input": "My friends and I came here for brunch. The food was just okay. We got the bottomless Bellini for $18, but it took forever for them to replace our next champagne bottle. May give this place another try because the Bellini deal is a steal."}
{"input": "Dr. DeMarino is excellent!  He takes the time to explain what he sees and what is causing stress to your body.  I always feel better after a visit.  Great practice and people!"}
{"input": "Perfectly seasoned meatloaf. Too bad it was served cold w cold coffee."}
{"input": "Delicious food and attentive, friendly service. Our waitress Jessica and bus person Sarah were fantastic!  They checked on us at just the right moment every single time!"}
{"input": "So this is what you need to know. Everything taste great, well at least what I had. I practically tried everything for breakfast and have come to the conclusion that this is the spot for breakfast. I have one gripe though, the monte cisto is not worth the price and is way over priced. I know truffle oil is used but that should not be the reason its so damn expensive. one egg, one piece of toast and some sauce. Don't ever order it, not worth it unless they drop the price $5. everything else is worth it taste great. Jebbs open face and the huevos rancheros are my favs. Enjoy. oh and the coffee is addicting. Also there are no reservations, so get there early or go about 30 min before u think u may be hungry."}
{"input": "Tremendous service (Big shout out to Douglas) that complemented the delicious food. Pretty expensive establishment (40-50$ avg for your main course), but its definitely backs that up with an atmosphere that's comparable with any of the top tier restaurants across the country."}
{"input": "First of all i wasn't greeted . Then we was serve on dirty trays that was wiped with dirty rags . Also the restroom was disgusting as well as table and chairs we sat on. Sorry but will not be coming back and definitely spreading the word of this place."}
{"input": "Holy crap worst haircut of my life!!! I feel terrible because she was so sweet but it looks like a 5 year old took scissors and started guessing! It's so bad I can't even wear it in a ponytail or bun without having choppy (what should be layers, looks like boxes) pieces that are super uneven hanging out. My ponytail looks like someone butcher my hair and left random pieces. Beware! I get my hair cut and trimmed regularly, figured this was closer to home and I'd try it out for a quick trim. Never again. It's not blended and evening blending couldn't fix it, the haircut alone wasn't straight, my right is longer then my left with randomly boxy chops. So embarrassed of my head!!! Have to go get it fixed elsewhere."}
{"input": "I just called to place a delivery order and they stated they could not do it. I have to come into the store if I wanted to get food from them. WHAT!!!!"}
{"input": "We were drawn in by the full parking lot... Don't be fooled... Not good.  Grouper was very undercooked, salad and fruit were not fresh and the staff was very rushed. Kid's cheeseburger was ok. Would not recommend this place and not planning on coming back."}
{"input": "I've been practicing yoga for a while now and I still can't believe we have a Yoga Studio THIS amazing in Tucson.  So many things to love about Yoga Flow.  YF has a huge variety of led classes for moderate and advanced practitioners.  Keep in mind, they have classes that are appropriate for all levels, but I haven't found another studio that offers really challenging classes for people that have a daily practice. Also, we have a Mysore practice in Tucson and it's right here at Yoga Flow! Tucson is one of a handful of cities in the US lucky enough to have an instructor blessed to teach by Sri K Pattabhi Jois. I can say that I visited many studios when I first started doing yoga, but when I found Yoga Flow I stopped looking."}
{"input": "Pretty good food, on the French bistro side of things. Went for dinner, packed on a Monday night. We were seated all the way in the back with a view of the kitchen\n\nThe choucroute plate was great, with a huge but tender smoked pork shank, boudin, squares of crispy/melty pork belly, and house made sauerkraut all nestled in a cast iron serving pan. GF had the special, fried pork loin with grits and greens that was tasty but pretty ordinary. Took a WHILE for entrees to arrive, but we left stuffed."}
{"input": "Burger was OK, but not at all worth the price. I felt cramped sitting at the long table surrounded by people I did not know. Service was OK. If they brought the prices way down, it would be better. As it is now, it's a really expensive, mediocre burger. There are much, much better places in St. Louis (both in terms of taste and value)."}
{"input": "We had lunch at the Brewer's Cabinet which was great, but then we needed some coffee after our long lunch so we asked our bartender and she directed us to the nearby Coffeebar. She told me about the Lavender Latte which I thought sounded interesting, so I tried one on ice and it was so good! I love the vibe of the place too. Very beautiful and great service. Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"input": "The blue crabs were on point. Never had crab nachos before but great first time. Service was ok at best, but maybe our waitress was having a bad day. But the bartenders were cool."}
{"input": "When I first walked into this restaurant I almost walked back out!  There was no one in there, and it is tiny and not to fancy. The only reason I went here is because it is across the street from where I live.  I'm so glad I stayed!!  Everything was really fresh, and really good.  I always get seaweed salad when I go to sushi, and it was pretty good here.  The spicy tuna was great! Overal I was impressed, its still not my fav in Nashville, but its up there."}
{"input": "Our 1st visit here. We went through the drive thru & ordered 4 Chicago dogs. The total bill was $10.  The Chicago Dogs were great & the only place in a 28 mile radius that you can purchase one. The only 2 things missing were a poppyseed bun & celery salt. My last attempt for a Chicago dog locally was Sonic (yuck). SuperGyro uses 100% beef hot dogs, that neon green relish, sport peppers, onions, dill pickle tomatoes & onion. I'll be back for more & also to try the other menu items."}
{"input": "Ordered a Kobe burger with wild boar bacon and cheddar. The burger was good but not cooked correctly. I ordered the burger rare but it was raw. It could have used another 3 minutes on the grill. \nThe truffle fries were very well flavored with truffle oil but were a little soggy/under cooked. \nThe place was very busy and they got the food out quickly but I would have waited another 5 minutes to correct the problems above. \nAlso, the floor was wet and very slippery. Walk with caution. Since it was the end of the night the place was a little dirty. The tables and floor could have been wiped down."}
{"input": "This store feels like home. Or at least it feels like MY home. Time doesn't seem to pass normally here, and every time I walk out I'm always amazed to realize how long I was actually browsing vintage sci-fi paperbacks or leafing through that illustrated edition of Nostromo or just being constantly distracted by 'hey, what's that...' So much of my childhood was spent happily drifting through cluttered, old-timey used bookstores like this, but they're fast becoming an endangered species. I'm glad Philly has this one."}
{"input": "Love going to this pool. The life guards are great. The only issues I have with the place is that I wish they would enforce people showering before entering the pool, keep on top of children without parent supervision that are acting out and clean the bathrooms/change rooms more. They get pretty gross. They should hire someone full time to do this since the pools are now free and can get pretty crowded. The life guards do not have time to do this."}
{"input": "Love Hope Flowers after years and years buying on line FTD or the rest.  I gave up. This is a hidden gem in the City of Eagle. Great and friendly service. Plenty of staff. Will do anything to make you happy.  The arrangements will be double the size of any online sale. The final kicker for me was the free rose i get every month.  Other of my wife's coworkers are jealous. It not just a flower but they add a lot of bling ti it.  Thank you. Now life long customer."}
{"input": "Favorite brewery in Santa Barbara area. Top notch IPA's and imperial stouts. Lots of experimentation and interesting brews."}
{"input": "Fantastic service and delicious food. There were a few vegetarians at my table, and our server Ritchie Rich (fabulous server) was able to make great recommendations and accommodations. The service was personal and attentive. The food was tasty and priced reasonably for a nice sit down restaurant. Another bonus is being able to make restaurant reservations since so many places in NOLA don't take reservations."}
{"input": "Cool place with extensive beer/wine menus and great service. The exposed brick walls are beautiful and the decor is inviting and comfortable. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"input": "Needed a last minute dinner choice last night. Great choice of craft beers. Fast and friendly service. Loved the burger! This is a top-notch venue!"}
{"input": "Very simple....great food, great drinks and wonderful service. Good for a date, family outing and to take visitors."}
{"input": "Having lived in center city Philadelphia previously, I was familiar with the Doubletree, and had high expectations. For the most part, this hotel delivers. When we checked in on Thursday evening the night staff (especially Kim) was very friendly and helpful. The accommodations were very nice, parking convenient (yes $25/day is high and standard for Philly, but you can exit and return for an unlimited # of times in the 24 hours, which is nice) and the rooms were nice and clean. \n\nThe cons: you have to pay for the internet, which is ridiculous! Also, during my stay I got locked in the sauna area on the pool/fitness level (not sure what was up, but I was able to use my key to get in but not out). I was very lucky that there were other guests coming in and out that night (it was 10pm, a low traffic time of day), and they let me out. \n\nI highly recommend this hotel, and will be staying in the future when I come to town."}
{"input": "The food was very good. The reason for the three stars is the noise level. I was with three other people in a corner table and we had to shout to hear each other. If the restaurant could work on the noise level, it would absolutely get more stars. The pad see ew got great reviews from the person who ordered it. I got The King and I (veg/chicken/shrimp stir fry) and it was excellent. Nice heat and curry flavor. The pad thai was a bit sweet I thought, but the person who ordered it really liked it.\n\nPortion sizes are not enormous. We had some leftovers but also didn't come in starving.\n\nGood service, very attentive. The noise level was the only negative."}
{"input": "I at least have to give this restaurant two stars due to the decent food. But while on a dinner meeting and after spending $100 on entrées and appetizers, I had to flag down the assistant cook, (the guy in bright red baggy pants watching TV), to see if I could get more avocado for my tuna entrée.  He made it very apparent and direct that he could not help me with that situation and I would have to flag down my  waitress so she could bill me for the four dollar avocado."}
{"input": "Great samples of beer, try the the flight. Good food! Love the atmosphere! Great service, good prices for the beer if you do the flight. I would recommend coming here if you love beer and different types of beer. Very time on drink and food."}
{"input": "Booking it for New Years Eve, this hotel was chosen mainly for its location, which is amazing.  You are only a block from the river, particularly Penns Landing and Spruce Harbor Park.  It has great views of the Ben Franklin Bridge and the River.  Unfortunately, this was the only positive thing that came out of our stay.  \n\nWe had requested for an upgrade suite, but I think we were given a regular room, shoved in a little corner.  We could barely roll in the luggage cart without having to pivot and bump into the walls left and right.  The rooms are average size but had a weird smell to it.  Their bathrooms are smaller than normal.  I assumed the room smell was due to the fact that you are allowed pets into the rooms.  \n\nThe Sheraton Club is also a lot smaller as well, with minimal seating for guests.  Pool is small, but I never expect much for a hotel in the middle of the city.  \n\nHotel, mainly for its location."}
{"input": "Nothing of extreme note either way.  Food was decent, pricing was decent and service was decent."}
{"input": "Very cute place with a great selection of loose leaf teas and other tea paraphernalia. The drinks and sweets are delicious and creative. Great relaxing ambience. As a tea lover, I loved reading the books about tea that the owner had. The owner is very nice and is very knowledgeable and passionate about tea. I would love to come back again!"}
{"input": "All-around nice place. No \"wow\" factor but solid service, good food and nice ambience. We were a party of 6 and tho it was a little \"strained\" hearing each other, that's often expected with parties more than 4. Solid restaurant; tho there are others we'd choose."}
{"input": "I find it hugely ironic that WF is trying to reposition itself as a 'value' food store right now when others (i.e. Trader Joe's up the street) have been doing that for years.  For value, go elsewhere.  For pretty food, lovely store displays and a feeling of smugness, check out Whole Foods.\n\nDespite my snark, I have to admit that it's nice to see an enormous, clean and well stocked yuppie market in Reno finally.  Now that this town has been rated by National Geographic as a top outdoors place to live in, it needs the retail to support that (and I don't mean another REI).  For myself, I'm too cheap to look seriously at this place for my regular shopping needs, but for lunch and the odd stopover, it's awesome.   Beautiful produce, drool inducing cheese selections and a bakery that would break my budget if I bought everything that struck my fancy.\n\nPlus it's proximity to the freeway (for those of us who do our shopping based on distance from the 395 or 80) makes it an ideal stop to/from the airport."}
{"input": "I ordered online through GrubHub a Spicy Chicken sandwich instead somehow they got my order wrong and I received Cajun Chicken Sandwich. Just I don't understand how you can get an order wrong when its ordered online. The chicken was supposed to be spicy, it was just regular strips of chicken not SPICY. I also ordered Turkey hoagie which is about 12 in long, the turkey is store bought. I mean its ok for the price you pay."}
{"input": "Great customer service! We were a little out of their pick up area but they were very accommodating and came and got our group of 7. When we got there we realized we were billed for 8 instead of 7. I called and he refunded my money for the extra ticket in minutes!\n\nThe tour itself was SO much fun! We were laughing and smiling and our tour guide was funny! We saw lots of alligators! From babies swimming in the water to full grown ones! We saw turtles and birds too! Our tour guide had a baby alligator we could hold that he's raising until it's a little bigger since it was a late hatch that would have died because of when it was born. The ride back was fun too because we went fast and the guide did some \"tricks\" with the boat! I highly recommend this tour!!!"}
{"input": "I was just passing through Tuscon. Native American inspired breakfast food? I just had to have some :-).  Basically I ended up with amazing and unique food that I wish I could have everyday! Five stars!\n\nIt took me while to decide what I wanted because there was so many things I wanted. \n\nFinally, I ended up with the pueblo, which basically is the green corn waffle with eggs the way you want it and a choice of a side (I got chorizo). The waiter told me how to eat it: put the syrup + hot sauce on the waffle and enjoy. But, instead, I ended up making an awesome syrup, hot sauce, egg, chorizo and red sauce tower on my waffle for each bite. It was delicious - try it!!!"}
{"input": "In love with my haircut! Very reasonable prices as well. This is my second time here. The first time the cut and style were amazing but the color was a little off from what I wanted but it still looked good. I will definitely continue to be a returning customer."}
{"input": "My mom and I went here for brunch last weekend. Just skip the food and go straight to the dessert. The cheesecake is HEAVEN and the macaroons are to die for."}
{"input": "Jones has the look, feel, and most importantly, taste, of an upscaled American diner. \n\nThe menu is a good size, lots of options for people  but not so much as to make me concerned for the amount of ingredients that need to be stocked. Perfect for a weekend brunch.\n\nThe secret here is the staff. Our server was one of the best I have ever had. She was friendly and efficient, making great suggestions (pickle juice in a Bloody Mary? Awesome!), keeping our coffees refilled, and keeping us updated on the status of our drink and food orders. Everything came out perfectly and pretty quickly. \n\nOur food was excellent, and serving gravy on the side for chicken and waffles is a fantastic idea. The heuvos rancheros were nice and light, and our request for sriracha was gladly met. \n\nOverall, one of the best experiences I have had in this part of the city, and we will certainly be back, and bringing friends to join us!"}
{"input": "Best service in town and best prices. Even the phone call just felt good. I called fast glass and they wanted to charge me 200$! About 80$ more than last time. So i looked around and found these guys. Called them and from the moment someone picked up i was treated wonderfully, they charged 165$ and it was worth the price too. I chip in my windshield spidered out and i was worried about a ticket, they fit me in that day. They vaccumed, wiped down the inside of my car and washed the windows. Waiting area is cozy and has tea, water and free suckers. They all treated me like a person, not a dumb girl like fast glass does. Ill definitely be going back."}
{"input": "Amazing!!! Alligator wings so delicious! Professional  guys work here, high recommend"}
{"input": "Went here for lunch with a large group today.  More than enough choices at the food court, but at 1:30pm it was super crowded and seating was limited.  All different options - Japanese, Indian, American, Chinese, etc... Not sure if it was the timing or this was the only place around but lines were long at each spot in the food court. If in the area I may stop in again, but definitely not on the top of my list."}
{"input": "Great service. I don't think I even waited more than a minute or two each time to have my glass of water refilled. Oysters for happy hour were great. Our servers suggestion of the Crawfish Bisque was a good one."}
{"input": "oh yeah...uummm hhhmmm....\nVisited for the first time and had the Sunday supper. The shrimp and grits was off the chain..hummus was lovely, beans great. Was a tad bit disappointed by the mac and cheese tho, needed to be thicker and less runny"}
{"input": "We went on a Tuesday evening and got right in.  Our service was fast and attentive.  We ordered Craig. Rangoon and it was good, but lacking in crab.  We also had the Vietnamese  spring rolls that were delicious.  For entrées we had General Wang and bankok Boom.  Both were awesome as we wanted them extra extra spicy and they supplied us with a spoon and some sombal oelek to add to it for our preferred spice.  A very good meal."}
{"input": "We were looking forward to dining here and made reservations only to wait over an hour.  We were disappointed.  The waitress wasn't very helpful with helping us order from the menu, which is in French.  She seemed arrogant.  Owners seem like awesome people.  We loved and miss the Bleubird cafe."}
{"input": "Cafe primo is one of my new favorite places in Santa Barbara. My partner and I eat their for happy hour at least twice a week. The elixirs (juice/kombucha type thing) are amazing! 32 ounces for 6 bucks! \n\nThe calamari is our favorite thing. We order it all the time. To be fair we usually only order from the seafood appetizer menu, but the calamari is nice. Also the tuna tar tar and ceviche are delicious. \n\nThe main menu is so-so in my opinion but the place is beautiful with floor to ceiling plan glass windows, a beautiful bar, stunning floor and great decor over-all. \n\nIt's a great place to people watch and have beer and wine. Plus they have wifi!"}
{"input": "Big shout out to Cecile for helping us load our plywood as we got ready for IRMA. Thanks so much!"}
{"input": "Terrible small portions...drinks were good but the bartender told us to get an heirloom salad which literally had one heirloom...plus whatever else we got was so small...not a good choice if you're hungry..."}
{"input": "We found cyranos on yelp and since we were in the are looking for lunch we decided to give it a try.  \n\nWe ordered the spices bourbon Collins for a beginning cocktail-would highly suggest it. Kinda like a ginger cookie with a bourbon flare. \nFor appetizer we got the ahi tuna-deeeelicious!\nWe then shared a Beet salad. Another party in the mouth. Next was the Cuban sandwich and we choose the slaw with it choosing to stay away from fattening fries. I would not chose the slaw again but I am sure that is just a taste preference. The sandwich however was amaziiiiiing.  \n\nService was good and we would definitely eat here again. I would like to try it for dinner next time."}
{"input": "Absolutely one of my favorite WF layout  and store inventory. Good amount of lighting, space, and inventory of pretty much everything.\n\nTip: restrooms are located back corner, just next to the bakery!"}
{"input": "This is the can't miss taco stop in Santa Barbara. Homemade corn tortillas served on the best steak, pork and chicken tacos you'll ever have the pleasure of devouring. Perfectly portioned, seasoned and priced. I've eaten a lot of tacos in my time here on Earth and these rank among the very best. Oh, and that salsa bar is still giving me daydreams."}
{"input": "Had the bourbon banana sundae. The bananas were caramelized to perfection and I could really taste the bourbon. Also tried the after dinner mint ice cream; nothing special. Place is a little pricy, but worth it. Service was a little slow, but the place was full."}
{"input": "Great staff always helps and always nice. Always clean and huge store size. Stays stocked with everything you need. The staff always helps make my custom breakfast bagel"}
{"input": "Love this place! I can't really speak for the food, as I am a vegetarian, but my husband loves it. They usually have 1 or 2 vegetarian friendly dishes and they are always great! The Mac n cheese is the best! And the drinks are amazing! I love a restaurant that sources it's good locally too :)"}
{"input": "A fantastic spot with amazing Sno-balls. So many great flavors, including many that are all natural. As an added bonus, the service is super friendly.  Can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"input": "BYO mexican spot in Northern Liberties\n\nCame for brunch and the service was great. Food was delicious. I'm a fan of chorizo and they highlight chorizo a lot in their dishes.\n\nBring some tequila and order some margarita mix."}
{"input": "Extremely slowwwwwww. Dinner took 3 hours, waitress and service wasn't great. Constantly asking for things we need, and from our bus boy. Food was mediocre if that, for the the price."}
{"input": "This is the first time I tried this place and  I was surprisingly surprised. I had a combination dinner pad Thai and coconut soup. The soup was very tasty as I never had coconut soup before. The pad Thai was exactly what I was expecting and it did not disappoint. The restaurant had great Thai decor and music. The staff and service was top notch. For a town with not much selection for food, this was a great change of pace. This may become my go to place in Carp."}
{"input": "We randomly decided to look for middle eastern food. Came up with Petra Restaurant near our home. Tried it with my family and liked it quite a bit. Try their Friday and Saturday special rice (it actually test like Indian fried rice) with lamb. Really tasty. Other things are very good too. Don't be discouraged with the location of the place, but food is good and inside of the restaurant is quite nice. Service is good too."}
{"input": "Walked by this place and decided to check it out. Great beer and burger place, made even better knowing many things were organic. You can order from the menu, or create your own burger. They also have rotating beers and specials. Nice atmosphere and staff. Burgers don't come with anything, so order from the sides if you want some fries. (There's also sandwiches and salads if you don't want a burger) Vegetarian friendly."}
{"input": "This was hands down the best tuna melt I have ever had. Very clean! This was also the best service I have ever had at a cafe. Awesome service and really on top of things. It's crazy because it is inside the grocery store! They should expand this cafe without the store attached!!! It would be amazing!!"}
{"input": "Amazing atmosphere! Everybody tries to get you to go to cafe du monde, but don't write off cafe beignet! The awesome live band drew me in. The staff was super friendly, and the beignets and pralines are ridiculously good!!!"}
{"input": "Ok going into this review, know hat I have never liked their beer.  For some reason it does not taste very good.  I knew this before walking in, but I wanted to give them a fair shake at the \"new\" brewery.   I tried to keep an open mind and tried the Westport Wheat, and the Red IPA.  I was not impressed by either.  \n\nI know again the place is new, but there was no personality to it, it was too sterile.  Everything looked great, but boring.  I did not stay long, find there was nothing there for me.  I tried to give a fair chance to them, but was honestly disappointed."}
{"input": "The reviews weren't all that positive, but I wanted to give the restaurant a try anyhow because you can sometimes find a diamond in a dive. I won't be returning ever... Although if up to my 2 year old daughter we'll come every day to see the fish. There is a huge Koi pond with fish feed you can purchase to feed them at the entrance. Not sure what the fish had to do with the overall theme since the ceiling is blue with sparkle like glittery cast over it. \n\nThe food was nothing to write home about and nor were the desserts semi frozen spinning in the glass display case. I really wanted to like the place even though my husband gave up on the spot, but the deal breaker was no hand soap in the entire women's restroom to wash my hands. The sign clearly states \"ALL EMPLOYEE'S MUST WASH HANDS\" how? I couldn't..."}
{"input": "STAY AWAY! I am a gold member, so I stay at Hamptons frequently. I have stayed here before, and it seems to be under constant construction. My room was dirty. I came back to give them another chance as it is close to my appointments. I show up for a four night stay, and they send me away because they are booked, but tell me I can come back tomorrow night. Seriously? I couldn't believe that. I wont be back."}
{"input": "Decent hotel. However, beware! Parking is $40 per night. Info isn't disclosed when booking room. Front desk receptionist was very non empathetic when I advised her that I wasn't aware of additional charge. Had I known, I would've booked a nicer hotel."}
{"input": "New to this dentist office and am very glad that I made the switch.   Dr. Gibbs is awesome!  He is very friendly and informative. You could tell he cares about his patients and does not push for any unnecessary treatments. Hygienists and office staff are also very friendly and helpful."}
{"input": "Giant chewy chocolate chip cookie ice cream and a working cow brand ice cream with whip cream and hot fudge for 9.50. Ok price for a really delicious treat. By all means a cheap dessert to split on a date for two if you want ice cream and don't mind a \"hole in the wall\" type of location.\n\nSerious cookie sits between a bar to the left and other shops in the right in a pink Clearwater downtown building.\n\nThe ice cream shop was not as kept as I believe it could have been and the gentleman running it was decent enough at greeting and explaining what he had left to offer us on a late Sunday night but didn't seem happy to be there to say the least. I wouldn't blame him. He's a grown man in an ice cream shop. Unless he's the owner.\n\nIce cream/cookie/hot fudge 4 stars! Needed more ice cream\n\nAtmosphere 2 stars.\n\nCustomer service 3 stars.\n\nUltimately I'd try another ice cream joint before revisiting this one :/"}
{"input": "This place has wonderful ambiance and is spacious for group dining. The food and service however are terrible. Everyone had something that tasted funky or didn't come right. With the kitchen upstairs and our table downstairs every problem took twice as long to work out as well. It is way overpriced. I don't recommend it and won't go back."}
{"input": "Good hours, complimentary beverages, friendly service. My only request is to be a little more sanitary (ex: please don't touch phones and tools with same gloves as being used on wet pedicure feet) and for more modern/on trend colors."}
{"input": "Best sushi around!!! Try their double punch roll! Aaaahhhhmazing! True authentic Japanese me sushi!  A++++"}
{"input": "I heard a number of good things about this place ,but I was very disappointed. Parking is terrible which isn't a huge deal but be prepared to spend a few minutes looking for a parking spot. We ordered 5 tacos total and it took about 30 minutes to get them. It seemed a little ridiculous for a few tacos, plus they weren't even hot. Slightly warm at best. Taste was ok, but wasn't anything special at all. Buffalo chicken wasn't great, the  Bbq and Korean were decent and the shrimp was mediocre. Overall, I gave it a shot and it wasn't worth the wait and effort parking so I don't see us going back."}
{"input": "I only go here when I need something that Trader Joes doesn't carry. They are overpriced, and understaffed. Not a fan."}
{"input": "This small little donut bakery is located in one of Hermitage's oldest shopping centers! \n\nI can imagine baking donuts is a hard job, let alone running the business...it's one of those jobs that starts in the wee hours of the morning so that the donuts are freshly made daily!\n\nYeu, the owner, serves not only your common popular donuts, but he also serves donuts with bacon on top, apple fritters, pigs in a blanket, breakfast pastries, and  kolaches....in addition to these yummy treats...he makes doughssants....they are what seems to be a scandalous marriage of a donut and a croissant...!!!!!!!! Need I say more? Yeah...you heard me. A doughssant! Worth the trip just to eat one of these! \n\nPrices are considerably cheap! The doughssants are only $1.99 each! The regular donuts are about $.60 each! \n\nThese sweet donuts are my favorite treats to buy for my kid's school teachers...and they love them! \n\nCoffee also served here!"}
{"input": "Late one Saturday night, some friends and I made the mistake of trying to get drinks at Plough and the Stars and left very quickly. We were walking around trying to find somewhere else to go, noticed this unmarked bar and decided to check it out. We were so excited to see that there were so many great beers on tap, and there was a decent crowd there so we stuck around. It was a fun night! And after a few weeks of wondering where we had gone, we were able to find the Irish Pol on Yelp :D\n\nI went back for happy hour recently and it wasn't exactly as I had remembered. It was pretty dark and dingy looking inside,  and the few people there were much much older. It just had a weird vibe. The beer was still great of course. The happy hour special was $3 drafts, but most of the beers I wanted weren't included. I won't be back for happy hour, but I would definitely stop in on a Saturday night!"}
{"input": "Probably the perfect \"cakery\" in the planet. It's tucked in a converted home. Once you step inside, you won't even realize you're in Indy. It's like one of those French cafes \n\nThis place is one of those places that you will probably see in the big metro spaces in the country. It's beautifully designed and no expense was spared. From carerra marble tables to monogrammed champagne flutes, this place is a sight to see.\n\nAs for cakes, expect to splurge. Don't be all cheap. Expect little less than $10 for a slice of cake. My fave is the owner's fave as well which is the caramel cake. All I can say is omg-  where has this place been. It looks ordinary but definitely a winner in the taste department. I can honestly say that this is probably my favorite cake ever."}
{"input": "Really enjoyable festival. One of the top beer events in town and a can't miss if you're sour beer fan. The hold back to this event is spacing. The event was very difficult to navigate at the beginning of the event due to how it was laid. Also was disappointed food in VIP ran out two hours before event ended before I even got any. VIP tasting was top notch."}
{"input": "My food only merited maybe two stars but I will give an extra star because I like the menu (and will try more of it) and their design and concept.  Sadly though, my tomato-basil soup tasted kind of like a weak marinara and my tuna melt type sandwich had a very sharp, off-putting flavor.  It was citrusy, for sure, and I love lemon in a tuna melt but perhaps this was lemon zest or something just way too overpowering?  I think next time I will focus on the dishes with cured Italian meats, mortadella and prosciutto.  And also the baked goods, those sounded pretty good, especially the Nutella bruschetta!"}
{"input": "The only knock on this place is that they didn't have all the pools open during Memorial Day weekend. Other than that the hotel provides a very friendly environment that's good for adults and families as well plenty of places to eat inside the resort and the atrium was amazing and really fun to explore. Little far from town but a good middle point between music row and the airport. Hotel staff was top notch and the place was clean while still having that old charm. I'd stay here again in a heart beat next time I visit Nashville."}
{"input": "Had a great time out with the girls! The instructor was super patient with these non-artistic painters. Everything somehow turned out the way it should look. Great time! Definitely recommended!!"}
{"input": "A pho place that checks all the boxes but doesnt have the best of anything.  We went to Lily's the day before, so I guess this review is a compare and contrast.  Decor is simple, white wall with 7 frames of challenge winners and 2 laggy TVs.  The service is fine, not as personal, but nothing really to complain.  The food was the biggest difference between the places.  The pho was plain, no complexity, almost like it came from a dry seasoning pack.  They also recommended the chicken vermicelli as one of their best -- it wasn't.  First off, they call it vermicelli but they used pho noodle instead?  What!!?? It was thick, heavy, and full the stomach quick --- everything a vermicelli not suppose to be.  Anyway, we left unsatisfied."}
{"input": "Whites are nothing special, Chardonnay was decent. Reds have some really nice ones - try Rossi Della Valle and the San Giovese.  White port is one to love! \n\nService was very kind and professional."}
{"input": "I have no complaints about this place food is always good. Everything i have ordered.. jamaican pizza and canadian pizza my favorite. No complaints I found myself going here 2-3 times a week.. lol lasagna special on wednesday is delish too. They run out so make sure to call ahead. Other than that best place to order in that area. Try it you wont be dissapointed!"}
{"input": "Great food for a great price! Every time i have gone in to Bab Cafe the staff is always super helpful and educated on their product and make recommendations. Would 10/10 recommend to anyone!"}
{"input": "My first time here! Grace did my hair....and it's FABULOUS! (And my hair is very difficult---super long and super thick). Great atmosphere, too--modern and clean, and no snobbiness.  Totally reasonable pricing! Highly recommend!"}
{"input": "I was a little worried about seeing the reviews but everything. Was great! Not long wait time. Staff was nice from walking in the lobby and asking which way to the office, to the office staff."}
{"input": "Anytime in Tampa I got to stop by Al's!!! Best BBQ in Tampa hands down!!\n\nChicken good! Ribs good! Smoked sausage good! Mac n cheese (Friday's Only) good! Yellow rice! Collard greens, spicy good!\n\nYou pretty much can't go wrong with anything on the menu!"}
{"input": "Mediocre food. very slow service , our food came one by one Within 10 to 15 minutes of each other. Rude servers and took us a long time to get our bills with lots of mistakes. Overall very bad experience"}
{"input": "Got my haircut with Elijah \"Eli\" and I have to say that the vibe in this place is simply amazing, just a bunch of guys enjoying a good cut and laughing.  It was great, Eli was amazing and the price matches the quality! Definitely my new shop up here on the North Side."}
{"input": "crappy restarurant with awful service and rude waiter. if you are looking for a GOOD BYO italian restaurant, go to La Baia on 17th and Lombard!"}
{"input": "They fixed a sensor problem on my Chevrolet Volt that a previous dealer didn't fix properly. Service rep Frank went above to help process my service with my crazy work schedule."}
{"input": "Stumbled across the set back, sidewalk cafe on a lovely, sunny afternoon. Plopped down with our beers from next door, and took in the jazz band that was playing under a tent. The waterfall that greets you as you walk into the courtyard is a nice touch. We cam back the next day, had some drinks (full bar there folks) and although they serve sandwiches and light snacks, we tried some beignets. They were excellent. Never had better. \nIt's a quaint little outdoor area that can't be missed. Either soaking up some sun during the day, or sitting back and relaxing while enjoying the live at night."}
{"input": "Had lunch here today. My cheeseburger was a 10/10 with an avocado on top. I also had the \"ranchero fries\" which are French fries with ranch, cheese, and tomatoes on top! The only thing keeping this awesome lunch spot from being 5 star would be the fact that it took a significant amount of time to get out food when the restaurant was relatively pretty slow."}
{"input": "My kids are 12 & 14 so I thought I might be pushing it with a trip to the MOXI, but since I had heard it was so great I decided it was worth a try. It is a great value for the experience and we were all totally entertained. Our favorite exhibits were the car races, the air chambers for the balls and the huge lite brite. Fun for all ages."}
{"input": "Extremely slow service (20 mins in an EMPTY drive thru) and first time around they missed a full half of my order! I come back and they're less than apologetic and proceed to give me 90% of my order! What does it take for a girl to get what she pays for around here?!! Not coming to this location again, just horrible."}
{"input": "Delicious and great service. We had six items on the menu including dessert and each item was melt in your mouth delicious."}
{"input": "OMG this place is the bomb! A local recommended it to us. He mentioned national awards for their donuts and I could see why. I also had a breakfast slider with best bread.  The place has a great authentic industrial rustic neighborhood feel with seating inside and out. Have you ever eaten food that is so good it feels like you're drunk happy as you sit and enjoy it?... this is that kind of place."}
{"input": "You will feel like you were transplanted suddenly to Europe!  I love Mazzaro!  Great place to come to fill up your fridge with healthy --- and not so healthy --- goodies!  Fair prices and excellent wines and cheese.  Heaven!!!"}
{"input": "The best thing about this place is the plethora of appetizers available. Its great to order a few and share with your friends. They have a wide variety of better than average spirits and some good craft cocktails on the menu."}
{"input": "Love their pizza! Eaten in and had delivery. The wait staff is always friendly. Their delivery service is always fast."}
{"input": "This is Seriously Thai..!! I can't believe I can get a good, authentic Yen-ta-fo soup in Midwest. It's one of my favorite noodle soup in pink color due to fermented soy; served with fish balls, tofu and crab. In LA, it would also contain on-choy,  blood cake and dried shrimp.\nI'd recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to try authentic Thai dishes; not your regular Americanized Thai menu."}
{"input": "Great treat to beat the heat! I stopped in during the Manayunk Arts Festival yesterday to get a cold refreshing treat and I was very pleased with the service and the quality of the fresh frozen yogurt and toppings.\n\nIt is a self service fro-yo establishment with countless options of flavors and toppings. I enjoyed the toasted coconut yogurt and topped it with rainbow sprinkles, fresh strawberries, blueberries and raspberries. The fruit was very refreshing but it was hard to select what to put on it because everything looked so yummy. If you are a chocolate lover there are plenty of candy toppings to add to your fro-yo too. \n\nIf you are not sure what flavor you will enjoy best you can sample them with small paper cups that so you don't have to find out if you like the flavor or not after you already purchase! \n\nAnother plus is that the establishment is kept very clean and it still looks as new as it did when it first opening on Main Street just a couple of years ago!"}
{"input": "I know people RAVE about this place, but frankly I find it A-OK. \n\nIt is a great location, the food is fresh, and they have a great variety of vegan options. But I find it pretty blah otherwise. I've had the crispy ranch and the curry tofu and enjoyed both of them, but I feel like I expect more out of a specialty vegan place. I did really like chick'n in the crispy ranch. The fries are pretty good too. My green lemonade was way too sweet and lemonade-y for me. \n\nIf I were you, I would try it because people love it so much and you get some unique items. But for the $10 range for a lunch item, I wouldn't  say it's nothing AMAZING."}
{"input": "Dangerous.  They are OK with life endangering, lazy repairs.  My wife insists on taking her Saturn there because they used to be a Saturn dealer.  She recently bought a new set of overpriced tires and these pitiful pukes did not put in new valve stems.  Down to about 13 psi by the time she got home.  The worst.  She took my truck there for a surprise gift oil change once which I really appreciated until SURPRISE, oil all over the garage due to finger tight plug.  Buffoons"}
{"input": "Delicious pizza and cheesesteaks! The taco pizza is especially good. Used to be awesome walking to Spatola's when I was younger from my friends houses. But, nonetheless the food remains delicious."}
{"input": "Be prepared to be unimpressed. Front desk lost our reservation. That should have been my first clue. Second is the musty mold smell that greets you at the elevator bank. Third is the ill maintained room. My stay here is due to a medical appointment for my son in the morning. My family and drove 8 hours to be here. We are tired and just looking for a place to get a good night's sleep before a long day of assessment. It will be our last visit."}
{"input": "This place was frickin' amazing! Some of the best, if not THE BEST mexican food I've ever had, and I've had a lot of mexican food. \n\nFirst off, the service was very polite and helpful, recommending some excellent dishes.  I had the tortilla soup, which had everything under the sun: tortilla strips, avocado chunks, sour cream, cheese globs, other good stuff that I don't even know about.  My brother got the cheese soup, which was really good also.\n\nI also had a shrimp quesadilla, which was really delicious, due to the spices they put on the shrimp,  nice blend of pepper and other unknown spices.  But the cous de gras, was the chiles, stuffed with shrimp, wrapped in bacon, and sitting in a soy sauce-esque liquid.  UNBELIEVABLE! I have no idea what it was called, but it's an appetizer, just ask the server.\n\nI would go far out of my way to make a trip back to El Merendero, I suggest you do the same."}
{"input": "I've had the crispy chick burger and fries with aioli dip several times and it's so good I'm not gonna change my order. If they could improve in something it would only be lowering prices."}
{"input": "I have to say the one thing about Joeybs that you get is great consistency from the food to the wonderful staff. There is something for every taste bud and excellent portions. And it has a lot of TVs."}
{"input": "My husband and I had their brisket and a side of green beans and Wednesday's jalapeño grits and everything was very tasty.  We tried three of their sauces and they all complimented the brisket very well.  We did not find the brisket to be too fatty and it was cooked perfectly.  We enjoyed the variety of restaurants at the farmers market and we're very happy we picked B & C Market  BBQ."}
{"input": "This is a gem. My daughter found some pieces. I jus wish they had more for my size and age range. Worth a visit."}
{"input": "Westfall replaced our roof in April. We could not be more pleased with the entire process. Quality roof, excellent communication and excellent follow up. Very happy we chose this company to replace our roof."}
{"input": "WOW! I had dinner with my husband here last night. Bernadette was very nice, and quick to take our orders, refill our drinks, describe certain dishes, etc. I've been in the neighborhood for years, but never thought to give Jon's a try! A VERY pleasant experience! I can't wait to bring the kids back. It has a neutral atmosphere (...a good thing!) that's perfect for couples, family,  co-workers, clients, anybody. It's neighborhoody in a sense that you feel like part of the Jon's family, which I loved. Looking forward to girly drinks & people watching once summer hits!"}
{"input": "I wrote this a while ago but never posted it for some reason. Tonight was our first time here & it was excellent! The beer selection was amazing. Our server was great as well. My wife & I split the fried pickles, with the chipotle ranch dipping sauce, and a dozen wings, half 309 recipe & half extra hot. The wings were very good but I could have used a little extra sauce just because that is my preference. The fried pickles were very good but could have been a little more crispy. The chipotle dipping sauce was awesome. My wife & I then split the Belly Buster Burger special, 2 cheeseburger patties, a HUGE slice of pork roll, homemade Thousand Island Dressing & fries! It was awesome! It also came with fries on the side with homemade ketchup as well as homemade chipotle ketchup. Both were amazing. I love ketchup & usually don't like homemade ketchup but theirs was excellent Can't wait to go back!! \n\nHave been back here a few more times & even ordered take out 3-4 times. It has never disappointed."}
{"input": "This is a great vegan place to come and dine. When I walked in I thought the place was especially clean and welcoming. Everything I've tried from this place I thought was delightful. I have had the chicken burger, ziggy burger, their smoothie and the sweet potato fries. If all vegetarian food tasted this good, I would seriously consider becoming one."}
{"input": "Funky little fast food place but terrific Taiwanese treasures to found, three of us enjoyed the window seating and samples several menu items.  Worth a try and then another and another!!"}
{"input": "Good food, great service. I had the vermicelli bowl the last two times I ate here and pho the first time. Delish all around."}
{"input": "I tried the cronuts a few weeks ago and they were bomb! Very very good. Too bad when i actually pre-ordered some they turned out to be CRAP, dried and hard. Not good at all. Wait in line for the 2 that you are able to purchase, at least they are fresh. DO NOT pre-order! As for cakes, i have not tried yet, but it is on my list!"}
{"input": "I waited to get a table. I feel like it takes forever even there was a lot of table. This bar is so dark. The table was still sticky and that sauce plate was also dirty. Sushi is okay but not great. I don't like the service and the atmospheres in the restaurant. Everything was so slow and it likes the waiter didn't see you when you really need to order. I don't want to go back here again."}
{"input": "There was a roach that crawled behind my shoulder on the seat. We killed it with a napkin and we were so hungry and know things are crazy with the storm coming. Once I received my food I had a hair in it. The waiter came back with a new plate after walking without saying a word and told us the manager said, \"we are in the middle of a hurricane and bugs are seeking to go inside.\" This place is dirty and beware of the hurricane roaches!"}
{"input": "Great beer and service! The servers have to take a course on all the beers so they know a lot about what they have to offer! They do take reservations so I would recommend that."}
{"input": "Nice set up, decent atmosphere and friendly staff, immaculate clean bathroom... *BUT* was truly served the FOULEST cup of Iced Tea I've ever had in my lifetime.  I swear I'm not being hyperbolic when i say my drink tasted like a vanilla-flavored 1970s era cough drop.  \n\nI can do better. next time I will."}
{"input": "I have ordered from Mayfield twice and they have exceeded expectations!!! They were able to make a beautiful last minute\nbridal bouquet for my sister!! This time I used them for a housewarming bouquet and told them what price range ($50-60) I wanted and they made very large beautiful bouquet with a base! Super impressed and will highly recommend this florist for anyone for any occasion in Tucson!"}
{"input": "I was new to the Westchase area and I was in need of a new dentist.  After reading reviews and the location being on .5 miles from my place I made an appointment.  The entire staff is great.  I've visited with Dr. Creech-Gionis  and Dr. Stern, they both are outstanding.  They make going to the  dentist less painful.  I can honestly say I'm 100% satisfied."}
{"input": "I was on the guest list tonight as my friend from high school was DJing, however, when I got to the front of the line I was unfortunately shoved through the front door before I could show my ID and verify my guest list status. After I was shoved through I tried to explain to the bouncer what had happened so I could properly verify that I was actually on the list. This bouncer then accused me of just trying to sneak in for free without paying even though I went back to him once I was inside. He then proceeded to belittle me and completely disregard the fact that I was allowed to be there. This ended in me being denied total entry, despite the fact that I was on the list, and I will never come here due to how I was treated by this bouncer."}
{"input": "Place is a bit run down. Office staff are not knowledgeable or helpful. They act like they don't have time to answer questions and absolutely are clueless on what is happening in the complex. We only paid for one semester (overpriced) and regretted not just finding off campus housing. I would never recommend this place. It is NOT worth the money or the headaches."}
{"input": "Wow! Best service I have ever experienced! These guys are true grms. They did not once try and jack me around. They were super professional and extremely fair.  This is the only place I will ever take my car for repairs! I highly recommend Sierra Car Care. Thanks for getting my car safe!"}
{"input": "Best dinner meal wife and I have had in a long time. Boar was awesome. Pork chop fantastic. Great service and cool atmosphere."}
{"input": "Found it on Yelp (because you do NOT eat sushi in a new city without reading anything), and have to agree: this is solidly four stars.  The sushi is slightly overpriced (compared to the West Coast anyway) but fresher than I expected, and the presentation is really superb."}
{"input": "My sushi place hunt hasn't finished yet. We tried bonsai roll, one night stand roll, volcano roll and sashimi platter. They did put a lot of effort decorating the dishes. We were very hungry so rather getting dishes as soon as we can lol \nEven though I appreciated their beautiful decoration, sushi wasn't that impressive. I did enjoy one night stand roll but bonsai roll had too much cucumber. I like thin slice of cucumber just round once or twice otherwise I can't really taste any sashimi because cucumber has pretty strong scent itself. I felt like I had big chunk of cucumber after all..the quality of sashimi was ok but nothing extra ordinary. And the bill ended up not that cheap. I think I could find this quality food with less price."}
{"input": "Must have changed management. I go about twice a month. Last two times pasta was under cooked to point of being crunchy  sent it back ask for another which never came. Then they screwed up hot dog order.  Then didn't take sent back dish off check. Finally got it removed from bill paid & left."}
{"input": "This pub is awesome!! The restaurant is beautiful...wood furniture and tv's in the booths. The staff is always friendly and helpful as well. And the most important thing... the food is amazing!!! I always get the prime rib sandwich and it never fails. I also like that they offer a vegetable of the day rather then having to stick with chips or fries. The vegetables here are always fresh! My only complaint is that it's a little pricey. I get take out a lot and for two meals it's at least $20. Still, this place is worth a try!!!"}
{"input": "You know how those 5 stars mean, \"Woohoo!  As good as it gets!\"?\n\nEach one of those stars is well deserved by Tanti and the rest of the crew at Papertini.  They specialize in wedding flowers but these aren't just your clump of red roses.  These are creatively and artistically designed masterpieces speckled with striking elements like papers, wires, luxe fabrics, and more.  As an added bonus, they're just great, friendly people.  A true asset to your wedding team.\n\nIf you want traditional wedding flowers, Papertini can do it but I think it would kill their soul - go elsewhere.  If you want something more unique without being artsy-fartsy, I can't recommend them highly enough!"}
{"input": "My wife and I had to leave Zydeco after being seated at our table.  We waited for several minutes for the wait staff to acknowledge us, but as we sat at our table they just walked all around us without anyone even speaking to us. A couple seated after us was waited on quickly and received their drinks before we decided to leave."}
{"input": "Nicest place I've ever gotten my nails done!!! They may have hacked a part of my foot off with the cheese grater but I went back and the service is impeccable !!"}
{"input": "Cheap. Large portions. The flavor is OMG! The bar just sets it off. I will be a regular here!"}
{"input": "They have amazing sushi!  Their rolls are creative and different from other places in town.  \nThe service is fast.  The location is very convenient for me since it is near Trader Joe's."}
{"input": "Looking for a solid pizza joint in our new city. Ordered a cheese and a Greek white pizza for delivery. Pizza was delicious, chewy and slightly sweet crust, and delivery was fast! Consistent and not pretentious."}
{"input": "If not for the pretentious, haughty, superior attitude of our waiter, I would have given this place four stars or possibly more... Seriously. That kind of attitude is exactly why I left New York. We wanted to order a bottle of wine, asked for his suggestion, and he answers with, \"How much do you want to spend?\" Ummm... Excuse me? How about, \"I'm happy to make some recommendations. Let's find a price point you're comfortable with...\" He didn't smile ONCE during the meal service and also found it necessary to correct us on several points of preference. Snob. The food is GOOD. The only thing that was great was the blueberry lasagna. And it is superb. So was the chocolate confection for dessert. I'd say go. And I hope you don't get that waiter."}
{"input": "My family and I love Chipotle!   We choose this chain most often when considering fast food.   This particular location was terrible.   We ordered ahead and first of all the order was wrong.   And may I ask how does a Mexican restaurant run out of guacamole??   and run out of taco shells?  and run out of the pepper and onion stir fry mix?   Also, the service was very slow.   The food was thrown together and not in the usual way.    My son called to tell them about the order when he got home, and the person on the phone didn't care.   I have nothing good to say about this dining experience."}
{"input": "We got up early on our vacation just to get to Pancake Pantry before the line.  It was well worth it.  The selection of pancake styles is amazing.  I had traditional and my b/f had pecan. Both were wonderful and were complimented perfectly by the salty deliciousness of bacon on the side.\n\nWe were told to ask for Mary and truly she was the sweetest waitress alive.  \n\nThis place is well worth the wait, but you could also get up an hour earlier than normal and beat the crowd!"}
{"input": "Stopped by range burger today during Jury Duty.   I've been wanting to go for a while and it was worth the wait\nDelish burger with bacon jam. Great atmosphere and a variety of patrons. The guy next to me had a chocolate shake that looked yum!!\nThe fries were hand cut and the variety of dip sauces was awesome.  I selected one and had the bartender choose my other two.   Really fun atmosphere.  I will be back"}
{"input": "This is my favorite Italian restaurant in New Castle County, DE. I always go for the blackboard daily specials, but my usual is Spezzato over Spaghetti or just a plate of Spezzato and a side order of their cheese ravioli. My daughter Kathy Stevens, lives in Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, and every time she comes home for the holidays, \"It's, take me to ATTILIO'S\" there are no Italian Restaurants like this in LA. I would highly recommend ATTILIO'S, high quality Italian Food, thank you Attilio and Carla. - Ray Richardson-Wilmington, DE"}
{"input": "This was my first time floating and I had a great experience. Walking in I immediately felt relaxed by the spa like zen atmosphere. Daniel greeted me and did a great job explaining the process. You start off taking a shower, and I have to say this was almost as relaxing as the float. Great water pressure and temperature. The floating part was so relaxing, I did not fall asleep but it sounds like many people do. I left feeling refreshed mentally and physically. I can't wait to go back."}
{"input": "Best Greek food hands down. This is my Greek go-to restaurant. I love everything on the menu but the grilled octopus is a must try. Very generous portions and the Saganaki is also to die for too. Quaint little BYO. Wonderful, and very good looking staff ;)\n\nOnly problem I have is the gyro meat. Its the frozen kind. Please don't deny this Zorba. I've eaten plenty of gyro's in my day. The only reason I am adding this in my review is with the hope that the owner see's it and makes a change! This slight discrepancy however does not denote my star rating. I am so very pleased every time I eat here, they deserve 5 stars in my book."}
{"input": "Searched for ethnic food and this came up, what a great choice! I had Ethiopian once before and it was good, so I was excited. The coolest thing is eating without utencils, and the next thing was the spiced ice tea, if you like middle eastern food, you will love this place. I dont think you can go wrong with any of the dishes here, not many chicken dishes, but thats my only complaint!"}
{"input": "Great spot I've been coming here for years. Top 3 steaks in the city! Nothing has changed even after the name change. Try a chicken cheesesteak for something different"}
{"input": "I never write reviews on yelp and this place was so good that I felt the need to login and write a review. The poached pear donut was ridiculous. This place is doing everything right."}
{"input": "Another great annual festival Edmonton has to offer.\n\nThe Fringe is over two weekends and the joining week full of performances. There's a variety of venues and plays to watch, street performers and musicians. There's a schedule online to find show times, buy tickets and learn more about the artists. \n\nHalf of 104th closes down to add space for a variety of food vendors and artisan vendors (art, jewelry, clothing, etc.).\n\nGood tip: there's a gourmet mini donut truck off behind the farmers market a bit tucked away. Amazing!\n\nIt's nice to take an hour or two before or after a show to walk around and casually stumble on other street performances. Or even go without seeing a play just to snack and shop at the vendors.\n\nThe location is absolutely fabulous."}
{"input": "Still a Great experience. Worth going out of your way to try. Food is excellent supurb service. They take great pride in their product, and it shows at every level. Do NOT MISS the incredible bakery!"}
{"input": "Awful business model it took forever to even figure out where to order. on top of that the workers actually are not professional at all. on top of THAT my other half sandwhich didn't even have sausage covering even half of the bread. easily worst place i've been in a while"}
{"input": "The food is always outstanding. I recommend the grilled chicken hoagie and their garlic parmesan wings. The wings are baked, which I very much prefer. Always tasty, and they've turned around their delivery and pickup time dramatically for the better. My go-to pizza joint in the neighborhood."}
{"input": "Great! \nGirl my phone was super attentive and friendly.food arrived hot and fresh. Think we finally found a good delivery place in this area."}
{"input": "I was disappointed for sure!  My mother and I went because we share a love for flowers and we hoped to buy some bulbs, flowers and get ideas for  planting.  Instead we learned about cookware, jewelry cleaner, beds (for sleeping not gardening), and many more gimmicks that \"travel the country doing this\".....Their words, not mine! Many of them didn't even have marketing material, just a promise for warranty.  I am giving this 2 stars because I was able to enjoy time with my Mom and did get one idea for landscaping otherwise it would be 1.  Unfortunately, I will not be attending this again and will be happy to spread my experience so no one else wastes an afternoon!"}
{"input": "Live music, nice patio seating, large bar with a second floor seating. Had the shrimp and crab and it was pretty good.  The bloody mary and the home made Pina colada was the bomb."}
{"input": "Best Donuts in St. Pete! Highly recommend to all. The customer service is top notch and prices are great as well. My favorite is the double chocolate donut. I think I could eat about 50 of them."}
{"input": "Really thought this place was going to be great. But it appears that the decor is where the \"great\" stops. Gave this place a try couple of weekends ago. Will NOT be going back!  The atmosphere is very pretty but waaaaay too tight, and the cakes LOOK very nice...but that is IT! Nothing to write home about. Spent $25 for 2 slices of cake. The whipped frosting has no flavor and my cake was over baked and dry. Expected way more for the cost. Cheesecake Factory, Flying Cupcake, and Classic Cakes are far superior. I'd even rather have spent $19 for a whole sheetcake from Costco...at least their buttercream icing and cake have by far more flavor! Hopefully, the cake quality improves to mach the decor. Then, it would be worth the 5 star price. For $10-12 for 1 slice of cake, you expect to be blown away, not underwhelmed."}
{"input": "I had a bad experience with a weird smelling fish dinner last time. So I do not recommend getting any fish dinners. \n\nBesides that, the ceviche is probably the best I have ever had! That is the whole reason I came back. Big chunks of fish! The hot is a little on the spicy side, so I will get the medium next time. The plate is big enough to split with a date. Then we split the anticuchos de carne. It came with chimichurri sauce. I would definitely order that again!"}
{"input": "Great food but the service is so bad we seen our waitress once  everyone else did here job plus I was not finished eating and she gave me the check    Hate that   But good food"}
{"input": "Friendly staff, but disappointed in what I got. My grilled cheese's bread was burnt. For $6 (and .48 because I used my credit card) I was expecting better."}
{"input": "Yummy yummy yummy! This New Palestine stronghold has been a cool landing spot on hot summer days for years. The food is good, typical drive in fair. But they're known for their soft serve ice cream and all the creations. I stick with the Chocolate malts and the flurries (Blizzard). It's also a pokestop that is frequently lured."}
{"input": "The food was great nice character! We sta on the porch durining lunch time with a beer I really enjoyed watching the cars go by something I dont get a chance to do.....Loved IT!"}
{"input": "This is my 3rd time and 3rd location at a Brick House across the country. This is by far one of the few chain restaurants I will regularly and happily eat at. The food is very unique and every selection is a good choice. This particular location I received better than average service. Will come back when back in town."}
{"input": "Looks like there is a second Red Kings restaurant in Chinatown and it did not disappoint! Since this place just opened yesterday, I'm not exactly sure if it's replacing the other Red Kings down the street, or if it is just a second helping of spicy, Szechuan food.\n\nWe ordered takeout and picked up the Dan Dan Noodles and a shredded Pork in Garlic sauce dish. The spice level in both dishes was perfect.  Extremely mouth-burning, but with delicious flavors that were sweet, earthy, and fresh. The portions were very generous and will make for great leftovers for us. I can't wait to try some of the other dishes and come back here for a sit-down dinner. They also have karaoke rooms upstairs, plus they are BYOB."}
{"input": "It's a chain but food is solid if your looking for a steak."}
{"input": "I ordered a turkey burger twice from here! And twice it was raw in the inside! And the messed up my order of fries every time I'm there."}
{"input": "Good breakfast...not all your traditional meals, but fresh and delicious.\nI love The Nest, sub with scrambled eggs.  Ask for jelly after you eat the eggs out of the biscuit; they make their own.\nStaff is friendly and quick.  Several pastry/baked options at the register.  Yum.  Fresh coffee and lattes"}
{"input": "Stayed here with the family for six nights on a trip to the Big Easy. A beautiful and charming place to stay. The staff from the doorman to the wait staff for brunch were  friendly and helpful.  The Carousel Bar is a must. \n\nGreat location, will be going back there for sure next time we are in New Orleans."}
{"input": "Came for Sunday brunch, ate outside- cute ambiance. Server was friendly and food was good. Not mind blowing, but I'd gladly go back."}
{"input": "Only complaint here is they charged extra for rice. Never heard of that, but oh well.  Everything we got was great.  The fried tofu in spicy sauce with Chinese vegetables were one of the best cooked and tasting tofu I've had anywhere.   The veggies were fresh and crunchy, tofu was firm and had a little crunch, and the sauce was spicy and rich to perfection."}
{"input": "The service by our server Tina was great..attentive and fast service. The wait was not long at all give it was a Sunday around 10am. 15 wait tops. Now to the food..MUST try the huevos bruncheros!!! Best breakfast item I've had in a long time. I mean I can't really describe just have to try it!"}
{"input": "food is okay but service is too bad. Cold face, arrogant tone. Don't like it at all. Never visit back probably."}
{"input": "I tried the Gourmet Pizza Company for the first time last night after having lived down the street for 3 years.  For a Saturday night, it wasn't very busy but upon seeing all the cars parked outside, I expected it to be packed. I had the Mediterranean pizza and I thought it was excellent. Definitely satisfied my pizza craving! I will definitely return as it is just a quick walk down the street for me."}
{"input": "Love this place, it's a casual Hispanic place with great family style food. I call it family style as I feel like I am eating at a Hispanic friend's house and their grandma is cooking. They have a bunch of fresh quick favorites in the steam table like roast pork and yellow rice or black beans and rice, but today I picked something I have had there before and loved, chicken fingers. I know crazy right? But it's the best and always fresh made. They make it like my grandma, fresh breaded and quick fried. That and a side of rice and nice big bowl of their amazing Spanish Bean soup/ garbanzo and I am in culinary heaven. This is my go to place for great comfort food. Cubans are pretty good here too. But I go there on the days when they have Spanish Bean soup and I would put theirs up against any of the good ones in Ybor City, yes it is that good, but sadly not on the menu every day. Call ahead, I do. Try it and they got ya!"}
{"input": "Came in with 45 mins to spare, employees were cleaning everything up and gave us complete attitude. All that was left was couscous and chicken shawarma. Completely bummed, I've heard such great things from coworkers about this place. Ended up going to Wawa because we were starving."}
{"input": "I have to admit that this place is a great place for KBBQ. Since there are some slim pickings around this area, this place takes the cake. I didn't wait very long for a table. The staff were very courteous and explained how the menu worked as well as how to best grill the different meats. I also really like how the hoods are part of the grilling area so there's not this bulky hood on top of each table. The sides are very good as well and there's a wide variety of sides there. Can't wait to come back to get my KBBQ fix"}
{"input": "Good food but DO NOT GO THERE ON JULY 4th! Called in my order 3 days before for pick up at 2:00. Not only wasn't it ready, they had no record of it! Finally got the food 45 minutes later. How a rib joint can be so disorganized beyond me. They act like this holiday doesn't come EVERY damn year."}
{"input": "This is the best pizza in the area! A  lot of people rave about Jack's, but Joey's has a unique taste. Their Italian sausage pizza is to die for! And the bread on the hoagies and cheesesteaks is phenomenally soft and tasty!"}
{"input": "I got quotes to replace/repair my bumper at several repair shops. These guys were the only ones who got on the ground to take a close look, everyone else just glanced at it. From that I knew they would do a good job. They definitely did and at a fair price too. If I need more work I'll be going back for sure. Highly recommend them."}
{"input": "I love shopping at Ross Stores. I stop at every one I come across. Yes, much of the merchandise is the same, but once in a while, you find a gem. It really is a treasure hunt. \n\nThey carry a selection of \"as seen on Tv\" stuff, a slew of Jr's clothing, a decent selection of ladies and missy, but they generally fail at plus, men's and petite.  These markets are woefully represented. Sure they have a men's section, but looking through the stuff, it's crappy t shirts and fubu jeans. Hardly anything the men in my life would wear.\n\nThis particular store's selection of lingerie/under garments is sad. They don't have a good variety of lingerie other than bras and panties.  Their home goods is very nicely situated as are their bed and bath items ... and their shoes!! My goodnes, their shoes are to die for!\n\nOne rhing I've noticed recently is that they are carrying many more high end designers: Michael Kors, Calvin Klein, and others at decent prices. So it does pay to shop at Ross."}
{"input": "Oh my goodness. Imagine a hangry woman speed walking down the street looking for some good eats. \n\nThat was me right before Yelp and this Taqueria saved the day (the alternative was Rusty's Pizza).\n\nI stared at the menu, practiced my Spanish, squinted at the jamon & pineapple, and order the sabores plate (with ham and pineapple).\n\nDid not disappoint!!  I expected the taste of ham and pineapple pizza, but I got Mexican tacos on my taste buds!  Growing up with Sonoran Mexican food,  I loved this unexpected find. \n\nAnd I loved that the place was very, very clean. The hot green salsa was also great -- sometimes people are exaggerating when they label salsa hot, but this restaurant wasn't messing around. \n\nI found me some good Mexican food in SB, and I'm now on the hunt for more."}
{"input": "Nice place to eat Mexican food! Friendly people and large menu. I have had steak burritos and stuffed pepper... the hot slasa at the beginning is very tasty..."}
{"input": "Had the worst service here. I also work in the service industry and if I treated my customers like that I would feel ashamed! I went there my second time to get my hair colored with no hair cut. The girl who did my hair worked nice and fast which I like but when I was sitting under the heat (or whatever they call it, dryer?) she already took her next customer!?? I thought that she probably would work on her new customer a bit and then come back to me. But she never did!! She had someone else rinse and shampoo my hair, plus I had to ask if he could please at least dry it a bit so I won't leave the salon with soggy hair!!! Because you should know that they charge $34 for a blow dry style!! What? Unbelievable! Also, the two times I called to make an appointment and asked about their hair color prices I got a different quote each time and it was always a cheaper price than what they ended up charging me. Very unprofessional!"}
{"input": "Food is absolutely amazing!!! The drinks were pretty high priced but if you are going just for dinner it's completely worth it. I found this place on yelp and after reading reviews, I couldn't wait to go. It was everything I expected. A must go."}
{"input": "It was very good!  All the meats (particular the ribs) were very flavorful: great seasoning, smoke, and char/caramelized sauce.   I really dug the beans because they had a lot of zing to them.  We got the feast and it was a good variety.  My friend got the chicken tenders, and they were just alright.  But, I don't go to a BBQ place for tenders.  I love BBQ, and I'll go back to Famous Dave's."}
{"input": "Excellent service and friendly people. I was so impressed by the nail tech's knowledge about skin care and nails! If I come back to NOLA I will definitely come back to this spot!"}
{"input": "Best coffee in town!  Its not easy to make a soy or almond milk latte and they do it the best and consistently each time.  They have a great \"assembly line\" system at the cash register and barista station that keeps the line moving fast.  Even at peak times, when its fully crowded, I never have a long wait.  They have a couple gluten-free baked goods to select from that are also top notch.  Sometimes I get a chamomile magic bowl and the hot apple cider as an alternative to caffeine."}
{"input": "Flavorful Thai food. Phad Thai is very good. Service is quick. The portions can be a bit inconsistent and when they are it's on the small side."}
{"input": "$12 all you can eat sushi on Tuesdays. The sushi was great, but the server was grumpy and slow. Order your next roll when you get served your first."}
{"input": "Troy and his staff always make it a really good time at the Macaroni Grill I've been here several times for birthdays and special events they've always taken care of us.\nFantastic food fantastic people.\nNever had a bad time here."}
{"input": "Good place to go for random books. However, every single book I wanted was new and full price even though they looked used. I am all for used books BUT at a used price! \n\nThe past three visits however, I failed to find any of the books on my list. The staff was very helpful."}
{"input": "My visit at macy's today went quite well. The clerk was very nice, she helped me out a great deal. I Ieft very happy because i got what i wanted, plus a discount."}

{"input": "Pim the chef is amazing!  Just returned from Thailand and I think I like Pim's cooking better!  Thanks Pim!"}
{"input": "The cutest brunch spot!!! If you have the chance, sit outside on the patio. It's just so lovely on a nice sunny morning. \n\nCame here on a Saturday with the bf. we ordered a brunch special which came with french toast, scrambled eggs & 2 pieces of bacon. We also ordered the roast beef sandwich. The french toast was delicious! It almost reminded me of the bread pudding. The only problem... it wasn't big enough!!! If I wasn't being conservative I could have eaten that portion of french toast in 2 bites. Not joking. It was good but not sure if it was worth like $7. The roast beef sandwich however was AMAZING! Boar's head never gets old. There was also some kind of chutney in the sandwich which is what made it pretty tasty in my opinion. And the sandwich was only like $6 and came with fruit. \n\nSuch a cute brunch spot. I would absolutely return!"}
{"input": "Place is top notch for the area - and so is the pricing.  If you want classy then you can't go wrong here.\n\nBeen a few times and always had a good meal.  I can't say much that put its in a different class then the other local stake houses though.\n\nOne thing to note is their 'happy hours'.  I've had several meetings at the bar during that time (5:00 to 6:30?) where the drinks are $6 and so are their 'Bar Bites' menu.  They have mini crab cake, burger and stake sandwiches - three of each for $6.  The burger and stake sandwiches are rib-eye I believe and really good.  They also have $2 oysters.\n\nAll in all - You can get a $195 shot of Lewi and a $175 porterhouse or a decent $6 sandwich and all with the same great service.\n\n**Please do the rest of us a favor and don't bring your kids here.  Thank you!**"}
{"input": "Went to this place with a coworker 2 days ago...very impressed by the sushi there because they are very freshly made with good variety. They have good price for lunch special - $13 for 3 rolls and $9 for 2 rolls...however, the portion is a bit small for those non-special sushies. I will go back again for sure..."}
{"input": "Favorite thing about Mel's: nobody outside of Manayunk or Roxy knows about Mels.\nThis is a TINY shack of a place that can hold maybe 15 people at a time on Umbria, which is a street with lots of older rowhomes and industrial/warehouse type buildings. Don't let the appearance put you off. It's divey, but good diners often are.\nIt's cheap, and the food is fantastic. I get the veggie omelette (no cheese, and they have no problem accommodating requests for what goes in stuff... the cook is 5 feet from you and talks to you herself!), because the mushrooms and spinach are AMAZINGLY TASTY. I think they simmer them in wine or something. \nThe wait staff is super attentive and friendly, even for the neighborhood. Love, love Mel's.\n\nThere's a parking lot outside for free, and tons of street parking if that fills up."}
{"input": "I had the bacon burrito. It was very good size burrito for 4$. It did not have much bacon ,but the green sauce was very good. I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"input": "First, Ted Drewes is more than the Christmas trees that populate its parking lot from late October to December.  It is frozen custard.  Pure sin - something that even the locals will stand on queue to eat in the dead of winter, because it's that damn good.  People have been known to give this up for Lent - and it's one of the things I actually miss about St. Louis (besides my family)."}
{"input": "Fast food style Greek food.  I would bet most of the 4 or 5 stars are from late night college students after a few drinks.  I would not be afraid to return for lunch as it is quick, clean, priced right, and the food was solid.  However, I have had much better Gyro's and Fries.  Everyone talked about the wings and the staff said they were great, so maybe next time I will go that route and update the review."}
{"input": "Great place!!! Always surprise me whenever I visit. I little bit pricey but definitely worth occasionally visiting. Best house made pastry series I ever had in Indy. I feel Coffee actually became second priority here compared to the food. Warning! It can be Qqqquite busy sometimes."}
{"input": "the apple pie was over run w/cardamon or another similar spice.\nthe cherry must have been made w/sour cherries\nthe blackberry was good for a few bites. \ni regret the purchase. especially considering the $12 price tag"}
{"input": "Cute Mexican place right on the corner across from the fountain in Fountain Square.  Overall, the food is good.  This is one of my favorite places for enchiladas.  The Enchiladas Mexicanos  is a mixed plate of one beef, one chicken, and one cheese each with different sauces which comes with the standard rice and beans.  I like how their salsa tastes a bit smoky as though they put a little chipotle in it.  The service has been ok.  If I'm in the mood to imbibe, I opt for a beer.  Their margaritas are made with agave wine as opposed to tequila, and while they taste fine, they don't pack enough punch for me."}
{"input": "The food here is fantastic but I'm taking away a star because of the service, which is often slow. If the food weren't great I wouldn't come back here because the service isn't worth it. They seem to not have enough people working there to keep up with all of the people and orders. On a more positive note, their sushi is some of the best I've had. (Pokémon Go roll is addictive.) Their beef Korean tacos are delicious and huge. My daughter gets the sweet potato waffle fries and finishes them, she never finishes anything except for those. I recommend this place for the food but go there expecting to wait a long time for everything."}
{"input": "This place is as good as it gets - MUST TRY - AWESOME!  Had the cuban sandwich and the chocolate and coconut dessert - FANTASTIC!!!!!"}
{"input": "The hubby and I started off with the supreme nacho and they were pretty yummy! Make sure to add the spicy beef! The husband ordered a 10\" pizza with sausage, pepperoni, bacon, and ham and I ordered the burger with cheese, mayo, provolone cheese, and BBQ sauce. My husband gave the pizza a 7 out of 10 and my burger was just above average. It satisfied my burger craving so that's a plus!"}
{"input": "So we were strolling down Frenchman Street, which already is a more local hangout, and decided to just walk around the surrounding Marigny neighborhood (which was absolutely beautiful.) I am soooo glad that we did, because we happened across Horn's. The delicious smell coming out the door drew us in straight away. We were greeted by very friendly staff, and quickly seated on the patio overlooking the beautiful homes in the neighborhood. I was glad to see that their menu had a very nice selection of different foods. I ended up with the \"Jewish coonass,\" which was absolutely AMAZING. The dish consisted of two potato latkes piled high with crawfish etoufee, each topped with a fried egg. I am craving it now!!!  My partner had the stuffed bell pepper and it was amazing as well. Very good prices, and also a good selection of craft cocktails as well. The next time we are in New Orleans (which I hope is soon) we will definitely be here again!!!"}
{"input": "I am in love with this place! ! A charmingly friendly and helpful staff. Incredibly diverse excellent spread for breakfast. Chocolate covered strawberries as a treat in the room. Great location across from Redding Terminal.  Great happy hour in the hotel bar!!"}
{"input": "Their cost is much higher than other yoga places for no good reason. Two-for-one session deal for a newcomer is kinda scam as one must use it within 14 days.\nThe location is out of way off the  busy highway."}
{"input": "Had the pleasure of eating breakfast here this rnorning. East Beach came highly recommend by some relatives who frequently visit Santa Barbara. It was a quick walk form where I was staying so seemed a great choice for breakfast before heading out of town today. There was a short line that moved quickly when I arrived. Two small complaints: the cashier who took my order was not terribly friendly. Not a huge deal, but also didn't give the best first impression. I also felt like things were a two overpriced. $9 for two pancakes seems a little steep. That being said, the banana wheat germ pancakes were delicious! I am not typically a pancake person, but these were great. Didn't need any syrup (which is great, since I don't really like an overly sweet breakfast). The pancakes alone were perfectly balanced. Light, full of good whole grains, and simply sweetened by the bananas. Plenty of outdoor seating and a beautiful Santa Barbara morning, made this a perfect breakfast on the beach."}
{"input": "If this spot plans to make it they need to have some mgt staff on hand during a busy holiday weekend. Service last night (Sunday May 26 was lack luster at best).\nShort of being very loud due to the flooring and ceiling choices , if they can get over the poor service model and re look at the logistics of how they run the front and back of the house they might have a shot at not losing there investment.\nThe deep dish was good , yet cold. Next time I crave some I will go with the overnight From Lou's.\nGood luck."}
{"input": "Decided to try a new place to get my nails done, and had an amazing experience. The salon itself is super clean & comfortable. And I got actual suggestions from Victor and ended up loving my nails even more. Definitely a place to check out, I'll be getting my nails done here indefinitely."}
{"input": "incredibly good on a second visit as well. the chicken curry is consistent -- perfectly spiced, garlicy. the goat biryani is phenomenal!"}
{"input": "Great Cambodian food in South Philly! I've been here three times (once to eat in and twice for take out) and haven't been disappointed once. \n\nThe must haves: \nMussels in red curry sauce (Cha Mussels): creamy, savory, and a little spicy. I poured the red curry sauce over everything.\n\nPrat-Hee: Minced pork with raw veggies to dip (eggplant, peppers, cucumbers, etc.) It's a little bit oily and a little bit salty but extremely flavorful and satisfying \n\nChicken Curry (or whatever they have as a special): potatoes and chicken and a delicious warm soup. Perfect for winter days. \n\nPapaya salad is also great for something light and fresh!\n\n4 stars instead of 5 because I pass out every time post-meal. Pretty sure there's some MSG in there."}
{"input": "Mike's Ice Cream is awesome!  They have a huge selection of ice cream flavors, many of them are handmade.  The nutter butter and Tennesee fudge are both amazing!  The red velvet cake ice cream is good too.  I would love to go back sometime and try out some more of their flavors.\n\nIf you are in Nashville, I would highly recommend putting it on your list of places to visit... especially if you are a fan of ice cream."}
{"input": "Fabulous Sunday brunch! Very kid friendly, vanilla lemonade delicious and everything fresh. Friendly service. We will be back!"}
{"input": "Food is typical bar food fare.  Good, definitely worth a return trip.  Not a fan of standing at the counter to order, but it is close to home.  We use to enjoy visiting them before they moved into bigger, industrial style digs, but after going for lunch on a slow afternoon, I found that the new place is so LOUD.  Couldn't carry on a conversation with my lunch mate.  Very sorry to say,  I haven't returned and probably won't unless someone throws a party there."}
{"input": "Great selection of steaks and perhaps the best shrimp cocktail on the planet!"}
{"input": "New favorite spot in Reno! Best muscles I've had in a sushi joint. Great menu options that aren't the same old rolls everywhere else has. The flavored sake drinks are good but extremely sweet, so be forewarned. Don't hesitate to check this place out. Great atmosphere and the best sushi!"}
{"input": "Dr Borst is a great guy....  we have had our pet with him from birth to death...\nPutting a dog or cat down is a pretty rough thing to have to do..  but I would \nnot want to go anywhere else for this sad event because of the staff and Dr Borst.\nthey make it as painless as possible......"}
{"input": "Casinos are just lame.\n\nAte at the \"International Buffet\", which was pretty standard.  ALthough...they did have real horseradish for the prime rib....nice bonus.\n\nThe only  time I come here is to see a concert at the AVA amphitheater.  Otherwise...I would skip it."}
{"input": "So we've been wanting to try the sushiritos since they opened up a location closer to us and we finally tried it last Friday. \n\nI got the slammin' salmon and my wife got the crunch. I'd say they both definitely had fresh ingredients, and definitely tasted fresh, but I think the balance of flavors wasn't quite right for the slammin' salmon. Way too heavy on the sauce, completely overpowering the crisp fresh veggies and salmon. \n\nWe tried the Japanese fried chicken. Sauce is a little sweet and sour. And the chicken was a little dry. \n\nWe also tried their green tea and lemonade, which were pretty good, but you don't come to a place like this because their green tea and lemonade are their best things on the menu. \n\nOverall, you pay a high premium for a gimmicky meal. With this location being essentially at a revolving door of new customers on the corner of Penn's campus, I think they have the potential to do well. But I don't think I'll be coming back. We'll take our $34 elsewhere."}
{"input": "Great burgers got a chicken sandwich. If I could have ate twice I would have got another chicken sandwich, if I could have ate a third time I would have tried a Burger. Homemade honey mustard and ketchup worth mixing together and drizzling over everything if you are a into that kinda thing. Fresh ingredients, if your used to eating at McDonald's you probly wouldn't understand. Would definitely go back!"}
{"input": "Excellent Cioppino. Great service, friendly staff.  Well located at start of Stearns Wharf."}
{"input": "So kudos for Sabrina's and Yelp.  Looking for a nice lunch in Reno, I went to Yelp and punched in some key words to avoid the usual fast food chain joints and up popped Sabrina's.\n\nOk good reviews, interesting pics and menu items.  Off we go.\n\nThe location is downtown but not smack dab in the casino zone, nice decor, trendy.\n\nThe menu offers some nice salads and soups.  We both had the bean soup (I highly recommend) and salads; Asian Noodle and South West.  Both salads were well presented, ample in portion, fresh and flavorful.\n\nWe took the recommendation of our server and had the house made ginger ale.\n\nAll in all a very pleasant, delicious lunch.  Prepared by nice people, in a trendy setting."}
{"input": "This is so perfect for Manayunk, especially for those of us on the go to be able to grab a quick healthy snack. It's always clean and the staff is always friendly. Sometimes the flavors aren't my favorite, but I love being creative so I find a way to make it work for what my mood is that day!!! Love this place!!!"}
{"input": "I really can't say enough about this place,  the food only seems to increase in flavor as they get to know me as a personal customer. I appreciate this so much and the professionalism that goes behind their customer service.I would tOtally recommend this place as your next Italian order!"}
{"input": "This is the best pizza by far in Reno. Crisp crust and loaded with toppings. it was AMAZING!"}
{"input": "New Day Meadery has delicious mead infused with different flavors, including coffee! I have been there a couple times and really enjoy the flights (and they are incredibly inexpensive too). I didn't have a great experience the last time I went there, as there were only 4 drinks on tap rather than the large array of drinks. They weren't my favorite drinks either. Hopefully next time I go back they will be fully stocked!"}

{"input": "Some recent improvements in the practice:  new digs @ 8th & Walnut, walk in hours, and u can make appointments on-line. \nThere were some recent communication problems between the office & my RiteAid pharmacy.  I finally asked for written Rx for all my meds, hand carried them to the pharmacist @23rd & Walnut.  Got 3 month supplies of most,w only a small copay.  That worked.\n The practice has (finally) gone totally electronic with patient records. \nDr Nizen is a first-rate diagnostician. She listens extremely well.  I'm still very satisfied."}
{"input": "Went for brunch this past Sunday. The hostess was very nice and efficient, offering us coffee and letting us know how long the wait would be.  Unfortunately, the wait for a table is WAY TOO LONG, and then the wait for service is WORSE.  We got there a little after 10:30 am, and the waitress said the wait would be about a half hour.  So we waited outside.  She was very nice, giving us coffee and refills while we waited.  After about 30 minutes, she asked us to stand inside the restaurant, saying it would speed-up seating. We then waited another 15 minutes.  We finally sat down at a table, and ordered our food.  Our food did not arrive until noon!  I had the bacon stack, which was tasty.  Unfortunately, I need to agree with other reviewers--the food does not justify the wait."}
{"input": "Very busy most of the time and hard to get a seat, however their Pad Thai is the best in town and worth the wait!"}
{"input": "Went recently for a birthday party and it was certainly worth checking out.   Was my first time there and I was pleased for sure.  \n\nWas nice and quiet as it was a Tuesday and the service was good because of that.  I'm sure it normally is though based on the size of the place.  \n\nI had beef n lobster which both were cooked well and I was happy.  Also the mashed and asparagus that came with it were both very good.  \n\nI wasn't to stoked with the appy we had which was these crab and cheese balls as they were very bland with little crab taste and no real seasoning it seemed.  Maybe just not for me but I wouldn't recommend those. \n\nAlso had Creme Brule which was solid and is get it again for sure.  \n\nOverall I'd say four due to a couple things like the appy and the shaky table, seriously so stupid to have that at a place that nice.  \n\nBut I'd gladly go again and would tell friends to try it."}
{"input": "Awesome sports bar--- and the food is great. This place gets overrun with the college crowd during the school year, but doesn't get as clubby/crowded as Sportsman's."}
{"input": "So good. Real Mexico City style. Alambres are amazing and few Mexican restaurants have them. Very authentic. My new favorite place in Santa Barbara!"}
{"input": "Love their food & Mimosas.  Appreciate the second location in Tucson.  Just be prepared for a bit of a wait during peak times."}
{"input": "If you're looking for something that will liquify the contents of your gut, the super spicy dosa will do it. I shared it with my father, who took one bite and called it the most destructive thing he ever had. It won't hit your taste buds hards, but internally, it's brutal. The soup that comes on the side was okay, but if you want to kick up the heat, ask for Indian green peppers to put into your dosa.\n\nOtherwise, service is quick, and noise is low. The dosa will fill you up, which definitely makes it worth the price and the drive. Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu."}
{"input": "I concur with the other comments that this place is awful.   The service here was about as bad as I have ever seen.   The food arrived cold and had to be sent back - which of course turned into a big ordeal.  \n\nUntil the management here shows some leadership and sets some higher expectations of their service and kitchen staff, I would avoid this place."}
{"input": "Our new \"home\" pharmacy and drugstore! We were very pleased with the neighborhood CVS, especially conveniently located across the street.  Everyone was very courteous and helpful. Thank you for the fine service."}

{"input": "This spa delivers. The atmosphere here is PERFECT. Calming and fancy--I felt like a princess there. It's very clean and the masseuses are quite good. Just make sure to speak up if they start pushing too hard during a massage! It's so tranquil there. I want to go back one day!"}
{"input": "Convenient location and foodcourt is a plus. However not too many good stores.  I mainly only stop by for Bath& Body Works. As far as the other retail store, I find the sales and selections limited."}
{"input": "We had a 2 1/2 day corporate conference here in the middle of June. The service was excellent, the facilities were very nice and I was fairly impressed with catering. Great spot for conferences or small conventions. Close to the airpor with a complimentary shuttle and complimentary parking."}
{"input": "There's no doubt that Fulton Alley is a great addition to the city. It's nice inside and the staff is very friendly. \n\nIt's not a true bowling alley though. Just like the fancy bowling alleys I've been to in Dallas, the pins are attached to strings, thus preventing mechanical failures that traditional alleys deal with often. \n\nIt limits the 'bowling' experience. . But the place is cool. Check it out."}
{"input": "What a great tour, very informative.  My family and I wasn't planning on going on the Budweiser Brewery tour but since we were in town we just had to go, plus it was free. I'm not much of a beer drinker but do drink every now and then but this tour was very interesting.  Our guide was very good and threw in some jokes from time to time which mainly was focused on the Chicago Cubs.  \n\nAs for the reviewer mentioning about not bring babies or toddlers, my 3 year old daughter loved the tour, so much was going on around her that she was distracted.  Of course she just had to have a stuff Clydesdale in the gift shop.   Some people are on vacation or trip and don't have a \"sitter\".  \n\nGreat tour, will do this again next time we are in town."}
{"input": "This place was cute and was in a great location!  It is one block up from the beach and wharf, two blocks over from State Street.  Parking was convenient, and our room was a King overlooking the courtyard and spa on the ground floor.  If there were people in the spa, they could be heard, but the noise didn't bother since the spa closed at 9pm.  The room was clean with a nice couch to lounge on, a refrigerator, a nice fireplace, ample closet and counter space, and a nice bathroom.  The wine and cheese at 5 was a nice touch as well.  Although this place didn't have a lot of extras, it was a pleasant stay, friendly and helpful staff, a good price, perfect location, and suited our needs just fine for a place in Santa Barbara.  My only complaint was that the room got a little stuffy, but was fine once we opened the windows and used the ceiling fan to air it out.  Would consider staying here again."}
{"input": "I went here after a recommendation that this is \"the best coffee place in philly\" and I'm so glad I checked it out! The cafe area itself is super nice & clean. They also offer tap and sparking water to customers which is awesome. Prices are very reasonable and the staff is super friendly. My friend and I chatted with one of the baristas for a few minutes and he gave us some pro-tips on how to make a killer espresso. I will definitely be coming back here again soon!"}
{"input": "I am conflicted about this. Driver was so sweet and polite and the pizza was delicious BUT it was BARELY warm. This is the second time this has happened. I hope they fix it, but for now I will try somewhere else."}
{"input": "I stopped by Mel's for a late lunch and got the turkey club.  The cook/waiter greeted me with a big smile and served me one of the best turkey club sandwiches I've ever had.  It was chuck full of fresh turkey on delicious multi-grain toast. While I was there, the cook took a pork roast out of the oven for the next day's sandwiches and it looked and smelled like heaven. I can't wait to go back to try a pork sandwich and to go for breakfast as well."}
{"input": "I have currently been sitting in the same chair for 36 minutes waiting for a take out order that consists of one combination plate with hot braised chicken. I haven't ordered anything ridiculous or out of the ordinary, yet here I am. If I didn't already pay for the food or had any confidence in their ability to refund me, I would leave and go elsewhere. I haven't been assured that my food is coming soon, had anyone apologize to me for the wait, or even acknowledge my existence. It's now been 44 minutes since I first sat down and I am being nodded at. I guess that means my order is ready. I'll update this review when I actually get to eat the food."}
{"input": "Guo Bin is easy to miss in the bottom of the retirement home on Delmar. We have been here numerous times but tend to order the same thing. I think they have caught on to our order...\n\nI always get chicken with black bean sauce, this is not officially on the menu. It is served with shrimp on menu but I can't do shellfish. They gladly make it every time and it is great.\n\nMy husband is a huge fan of the hot braised chicken wings. He likes all food served spicy.\n\nThe egg rolls and egg drop soup are standard orders and always good.\n\nThey have a great lunch buffet if you are in the area."}
{"input": "Spectacular trip all around.  Erin was a phenomenal guide - we had one member of the group who felt sick from the boat ride out, so he did half the trip, then we picked her up and she got to enjoy the second half with us.  He really worked with us to ensure that we had the best time possible.  The Channel Islands are like visiting CA a hundred years ago - teaming wildlife, crystal clear waters, air so sweet and clean your lungs rejoice.  Was a memorable trip!  Reminders:  you pack in and out all your food and drinks, so be sure to bring garbage bags.  Don't forget the dramamine and sunscreen!"}
{"input": "I would start listing my favorite things about Smiley's, but the list would be impossibly long. New York has incredible middle eastern food, but this is, bar none, the best I've ever had in my life. Best chicken schwarma, best seasoned falafel, best (and most massive) vegetarian platters. The portions are huge, and did I mention delicious? Two very hungry people could make a great meal out of one serving.\nI've had the garlic chicken- shredded white meat with many optional sauces, making each bite a different taste experience, as well as the vegetarian platter, which was so gigantic that my very hungry friend and I still had two containers to take home. Everything tasted fresh and delicious.\nThe service is also five stars.

{"input": "Oh, that tiramisu! So good! Parts of it were a little dry, but I still give it 5 stars. Kind of pricey though. Next time, I'll probably try the cheesecake."}
{"input": "Great spot! Also has breakfast until 3 vs many places which end at 11. The eggs Benedict and eggs Florentine were delicious. Strawberry mimosa was a bit sweet but good. Bloody mary is bomb! Server was very nice."}
{"input": "We just had my daughter's first birthday party and ordered from Testa's the black-white cake with buttercream frosting.  We also ordered a single mini-sized same cake just for my daughter.  They were both delicious!  Service was exceptional.  They scanned a photo for the half-sheet (easily fed 30 ppl) and it came out great."}
{"input": "Great vibe, great food.  Stands out even in a town with lots of good eats."}
{"input": "Great place to just sit and watch the game with a nice cold cup of beer.\nBartender was great and very attentive. Hosts definitely need a lesson on smiling. Hosts are thee first and  last person you see when at a restaurant. Went here twice first one a Sunday to watch a football game. Had a Golden Dollar Pale Ale. highly recommended for beerginners, ( beer beginners get it lol:) I also had these criss cut fries with nacho cheese, bacon, pulled pork and some other toppings that I totally forgot  but I did upload a picture. it was bomb.\nGreat selections on beer \nSecond time was on a Monday, during HH which was I believe between 2 and 5pm. Had the chicken wing. 12 for $3.95 great price and $3 beers.\nOverall one of only place I like to chill at so far inside the MGM Casinos in Reno"}
{"input": "Well stocked, plenty of clearance items on sale. The staff leaves you alone and doesn't heckle you, but is available if you need anything. It's a good shop to get some athletic adventure gear and look fashionable."}
{"input": "My girlfriend and I had the best time here!  Definitely the most fun and relaxed place for wine tastings. Great wines with good prices. We will for sure be back."}
{"input": "Nice Steakhouse in St. Louis. We went here for a client dinner and was pleasantly surprised. You get a nice view of the arch on the way in to the restaurant as well. \n\nThe Apps were OK. We ended up getting the Carmine's trio (crab cakes, scallops and toasted ravioli). Crab cakes were above average. The scallops were a little saccharine for my tastes but the ravioli was good; and let's face it...one doesn't come to St. Louis for the scallops. Thankfully the filet mignon was exceptional. It was the perfect size, not too salty and rare just like I had requested. \n\nThis was partnered with an above average wine list to make a great night out."}
{"input": "Finally got to eat here last night. Eclectic foodie menu. I had their onion tart as an app and Kerry had the veal meatballs with sauce on polenta, very delicious. The red gravy tasted like my own. We both ordered the special of citrus short ribs with fat noodles and brussel sprouts, peas. couldn't finish we will be back to try other interesting items. Small crowded but great friendly atmosphere"}
{"input": "I can only say that I completely agree with everything Dan N said on his review. Basically same experience. One person in our party ordered the Roll and it can only half baked with raw dough in the middle. Waitress got an attitude with us like it was our fault. They put the roll back in the oven for a few and brought it back still uncooked. Now we are sitting here still waiting for the replacement to come and all are finished with our meals. Ugh!!"}
{"input": "Note: This is not a fast food place. Expect to wait about 15-20mins for a sandwich & fries.\nI had the turkey with avocado, etc & it was ok. Could have used more aioli, so it was a little dry since the bread is thick. The fries are the size of McDonald's & are garlicky. Wolfgang is a better choice health wise. However, was it worth the $11.99 + tax, not in my opinion but it is the airport. Idk what other places are around, but I'll explore more the next time."}
{"input": "Excellent!!! Got the broiled octopus!!! Super tender!!!! Excellent service !! Server was on point all time !!! Desserts are awesome !!!!!"}
{"input": "We arrived for lunch at 12p on a Friday - wasn't busy at all. It took FOREVER to get anything. We were really pleasant and kind but we had to complain several times to get any beverages that we ordered. It took them 40 minutes to let us know that a beer we ordered was no longer available. The food was great, but not worth the lengthy wait and slow service."}
{"input": "I have been to Firebirds wood fired grill a number of times now. I do have to say this is one of my favorite places to celebrate happy hour. The happy hour drink special are good and the food is fantastic! I would highly recommend trying the double black diamond martini. It is fantastic. My wife and I enjoy sitting at the bar drinking and having a few cocktails and snacking on Shrimp Tacos and Beef Sliders. I would highly recommend this place to family and friends. It does get busy there."}
{"input": "Gosh, I'm going against the grain here but I was not impressed. My food was bland, the spring rolls were fishy, the soda chanh was intensely sugared and I left feeling, \"eh.\" We went last Friday and I ate pesce while there. I went with the tofu lemongrass and I seriously wish there was more sauce. It barely covered my tofu which left me eating unsauced noodles. I tried adding a ton of add-ons to try and get some flavor out of the sauce but no dice. The peanut sauce for the shrimp rolls was super watery and again the shrimp tasted old. The soda chanh was crazy sweet. I still enjoyed it but between that and the food I wavered between over-sugared and over-salted. My manpanion had the pho and he gave it an \"eh\" as well. I will say the prices were pretty awesome but I'm not sure we'll be back. There are other Vietnamese restaurants that I would rather frequent, e.g. Far East. FYI - they are now run by the owners of Miss Saigon and I had that very same dish there. It was sauced well and had much more flavor."}
{"input": "Amazing new BYOB - very unique concept. Things that dont sound like they would necessarily go together are delish!"}
{"input": "Went here after hoping on a plane. Quick lunch and had the Chicken Sandwich with fries. The bread on the sandwich was great. Chicken was normal but better than most. Atmosphere is a bit like a fast food place. Prices are slightly high so be aware of that. Other plates on the table were the Canelli' Special. They said the chicken was fantastic. They also liked the Yucca and rice. Would recommend if need a quick meal and the atmosphere is not an issue. Also, it's not a huge place."}
{"input": "If I could give Zero stars I would. We are return customers to this restaurant and now we will never return. We will go out of our way to go to the one in mid-city. We ordered the new sandwich \"The BET\" and paid an extra $2.00 for extra cheese. We received this sandwich with close to ZERO cheese. You would think for a \"cheese\" themed restaurant all of their sandwiches would be gooey with cheese. WRONG. The cheese on the sandwich didn't even cover 1/2 of the 1/2 of one side of the piece of bread. We mentioned it to Ebony at the register that we paid for extra cheese and showed her the sandwich. She brought it to the kitchen and shortly returned to us with our sandwich in hand and said \"my kitchen supervisor said there is cheese on this sandwich and he can't help us\" we asked if we can just add more cheese and she said \"if we want more cheese we will have to pay for it\" (which we already did) \"and he refuses to remake it\" terrible kitchen staff and HORRIBLE at handling service."}
{"input": "I was Sitting down  sipping a coffee and  waiting on a sandwich for 25 minutes or more.  \n so when I went to cancel the order being I had an appointment to make I was told \" but it's ready\"\nI look at the toast on the toaster tray and not a sandwich ready and say \"just the coffee please I really need to go.\" \n The owner says \"ok, one fifty for coffee next time if your in a rush say something\" \n    so I hand her a ten dollar bill and she gives me eight dollars back then turns away and leaves\n I guess I paid the extra fifty cents for the toast that was not used.......  NEVER AGAIN!!!"}

{"input": "I have been coming to this nail salon off and on for the last few years.  They are consistently friendly and do quality work. Today I had, hands down, the best pedicure ever!  The tech massaged my legs for such a long time, way longer than a normal service. And there was no extra charge for the extra attention. The techs are always in tune to whether or not you want to sit and relax or chat. I never feel like they are talking my ear off and I love that! They take walk ins and accept appointments. I just love this place. Ahhhhhhh :)"}
{"input": "I've had good experiences and bad experiences at Pep Boys. Today was one of those great experiences. I stopped in to see if they could change my headlight bulbs. The gentleman who greeted me, in the most friendly way, came right out to look at the car. He said he could take care of it right away. It took about 10 minutes for him to complete the task. During it all he was funny, friendly, and so nice. I did not get his name but he said he is the manager. After he finished I went inside to pay and he waived me off. He said no charge! Wow! What a great experience!"}
{"input": "I came here with my girlfriends and let me tell you, it gets packed fast. We ate oysters for breakfast and it was so worth it. The server that we had memorized all 6 of our complicated customized orders. I was very impressed. Oysters here taste like the fresh ocean. I ordered the oyster po-boy and that deliciousness came out fast. I definitely recommend this place when visiting NOLA."}
{"input": "Great food and sweets are out of this world! Snapper is just Old World, Cook whole and super tasty. Service is great too. One star less for cleanliness, Bathrooms need some major scribing and remodeling. I hate to see kitchen , hahaha!"}
{"input": "Best pizza in reno.  We came across this place when looking on yelp for a new pizza place. The pizza is so good and they deliver fast. Just goes to show little whole in the wall places are the best."}
{"input": "My favorite happy hour spot. Discovered how amazing all the appetizers are back in summer 2011 center city sips (great time to check out all the different center city happy hour spots). The mac & cheese is great!\n\nThey have a great selection of beers on tap and bottles. The food is superb! If you're looking for a private party space, they have a cozy basement space with a personal bar. Only thing is occasionally you'll have some crashers who want to use the ATM and restroom (even though there is one on the second floor and 2 on the 3rd)\n\nJust go! You won't be disappointed"}
{"input": "Cafe Beignet and Musical Legends Park offers a great reprieve from the hustle and bustle of Bourbon Street. If you're still looking to drink while listening to some live jazz, the bar has got you covered with cocktails and alcoholic slushes. \n\nMy boyfriend and I popped by on a Monday night around 8pm for some beignets to compare to the ones we had over at Cafe Du Monde. Beignets here are $3.99 for three. We ordered pretty quickly and were able to snag one of the few empty tables. While the service was incredibly slow, we found ourselves mostly distracted by music and just basking in the ambience. \n\nThe beignets were fantastic- came freshly fried and hot with healthy dustings of powered sugar. I would have liked more sugar, but it was perfect for my boyfriend. We also got a southern comfort mango slush to share, which was pretty good and felt solidly packed with alcohol."}
{"input": "Picking out accessories for the girlfriend is never easy.  Lucky to have had Katie's assistance this time! Mushmina has awesome unique products and reasonable prices.  Thanks so much!"}
{"input": "I really liked it here. I always have a hard time going to a humane society but this was a positive experience (maybe because we're getting two kitties tomorrow!). \n\nIt is laid out nicely, it does smell like poop but what do you expect with hundreds of animals in one place. It's very clean, the staff is polite and helpful (and really seem to know/love the animals) and I love that they microchip, spay, neuter and immunize the animals. \n\nThey are even having a special deal for Valentine's Day where it's only 14$ to adopt compared to 50$. This is HUGE because it meant we can get both of the kitties who are the same litter and came in together. \n\nI wish more people would go here to get their pets!"}
{"input": "Cake Life is one of my favorite bakeries-and I've only been there once! I ordered the chocolate chip walnut cookie, while my sister ordered the Campfire Cocoa cake. We received the Fiesta cake by accident, and the server was kind enough to allow us to keep both slices of cake. The cookie was crispy on the outside but chewy on the inside. Could've used a little bit more sea salt but the chocolate chips were so fudgey and rich so I didn't have much to complain about. The campfire cake was delicious. The cake is moist and fluffy, while the whipped cream is chocolatey. Reminded me of the days I'd come back home from school on a winter day and I'd rip one of those Swiss Miss packets open into warm milk. The buttercream is made with Swiss Miss by the way! The Fiesta cake is a bit more dense, with a cream cheese frosting. Definitely an enjoyable experience. The shop itself is very cute and beautiful. I'll be returning... very soon!"}
{"input": "Pleasantly surprised by the presentation of the nice selections.  If I were not here for a biz trip, I would be planning my next visit back!  Good food!"}
{"input": "All you can drink brunch? Yes please!\n\nSat and Sun they got brunch item and unlimited bloody marys or mimosas for $20. Perfect for some Sunday Funday. Enjoy!"}

{"input": "Not a bad place if you're passing through Indy/speedway area. I had the dirty lemonade. It was flavorful but a bit weak for my tastes. I had the heart-attack, which is a generous portion of pulled pork with bacon & house bbq sauce on a warm bun (also a fried egg, but I ditched the egg). It was pretty good, but the real flavor was in the sauce; I wish the pork itself was as flavorful. Also, for kicks I put a few of their onion rings on my sandwich. Nailed it. I'm thinking if the onion rings became a regular part of this sandwich, I'd up my rating from 3 stars to 4 easily."}
{"input": "I love the owner!  He's amazing!!  The only complaint I have is that the service from the server's isn't that fabulous.  We had our rehearsal dinner here and while the food was OK, the service wasn't good at all.  We waited so long for food and just refills.  My husband and I visit this restaurant for ourselves and have no issues but I would not recommend having a large crowd here."}
{"input": "Magical vegan heaven. My wife and I stopped here on a detour from our route back home to Boston and she (a non-vegan) devoured their Philly steak. I literally had to pry her away from ordering more; I don't blame her at all though because the food was damn good. I had the curry tofu wrap and it was delicious. The place is pretty small with limited seating so a lot of people were taking (and I'm assuming regularly take) their food to go, so I'd be wary of this if you're wanting to sit in. \n\nBut yeah this place rocks. Their kale lemonade alone is worth the 5 stars. Next time we're in Philly this place will be among the first in which we stuff our faces."}
{"input": "Worst roast pork sandwich I've ever had. The broccoli rabe was lifeless and freezing. It was so cold my cheese didn't melt. The bread was soggy and wet. Horrible. If I wasn't in an airport, I'd bring this back."}

{"input": "Will never go to this dealership again.\n\nGot a written price quote via email for a Honda Odyssey. Went to the dealership, but they did not have the color and model I wanted (in which case why quote a price, but lets just ignore that as agressive marketing.) We agreed that they would add a DVD player to a lesser model, and also agreed on the price - this time with a printed quote in my hand. Went back after a week to close the deal and pick up the van, but they wanted a higher price, in effect renegging on the deal.\n\nI walked out.\n\nWent to a different dealership - Burns Honda - where I got the model I wanted and at the promised price."}
{"input": "I have been in this store twice.  It is clean, uncluttered and seems to have a wide variety of products. The clerks and service people need to work on smiling. They seem a little grim and preoccupied. Also items I was shopping for we're not clearly priced and the deli only had 2 sizes of containers. I think there is great potential but things need to come together."}
{"input": "I'm almost thankful that there is usually a line for this place.  If there was not, I would eat here daily, and become obese.  I've only been here once, but my friend and I tried 4 different kinds of pancakes.  We had banana bread (probably our favorite, the famous sweet potato, raspberry, and chocolate chip.  All of them were awesome. We also felt the need to eat potatoes and bacon.. Because night shifters are ravenous when they get off work in the morning.  Just take everyones word for it and eat here and then take the rest of the day off to recuperate from your food coma."}
{"input": "Seen this place many times and finally got to try it last night with my husband.  Overall location is OK with plenty of parking.  There seems to be seating for a larger group down to a couple table.  The waitress we had was really nice and prompt with everything.  The salsa and chips were good but the salsa had a hint of sweetness that I'm not use to.  I had the carne asada fajitas and they were delicious.  My husband had the carne asada tacos and enjoyed it.  We also tried the pupusas which I've never heard before but my husband has been recommended years ago to try the dish.  It was yummy, spicy but definitely something to finish there as the sauce can make it mushy after some time.  Drinks were out of bottles but plenty of ice was always provided.  Decent prices and clean place.  Will be returning in the future."}
{"input": "This place was great if you're just looking for a bar that serves good drinks. We didn't eat there, but it was relatively clean and seemed like the food was OK too. Perfect for a pre-game drink if you're going to a Penn sporting event as we were. We just stumbled upon the place, but I wish I had known about it prior to going there.\nKind of like a Fado Irish Pub, but slightly better"}
{"input": "Haven't had much experience in the line of Cuban food...but I do love a good Cuban sandwich, and Taste of Havana gave me my best Cuban sandwich experience yet!  All sandwiches can be ordered in 3 different sizes, which is nice if you aren't starving and want smaller portions.  Tried the yuca chips, good salty crunchy alternative to potato chips.  The owner was very nice....he is originally from Cuba so all items on the menu are authentic Cuban sandwiches.  For dessert we had a guava cream cheese pastry which was amazing.  Small and quaint place, good and friendly service, good food...gets my vote!!  Adds a good mix to the eclectic broadripple food scene :)"}
{"input": "Ok so this place is my favorite and the only salon I will go to.  I been going here for years and I have never felt disappointed or unhappy. \n\nThe salon is so cute and chic just like all of the staff. I have never been to a place that better customer service. From the minute you walk in until you leave you are treated wonderfully . You are always offered a drink . \n\nThe stylist are extremely talented. Their work is amazing  the staff go to a lot of Trainings all over the country to keep up with techniques .  I typically use Brittney who really great with balayage and coloring  but I used other staff for blowouts. I am forever grateful to the tease staff to keeping my crazy curls in check!"}
{"input": "My wife and I loved everything about this diner. The decor is lovely & the food was great. I had the cheese steak and it was much better than Geno's.  Our server was awesome"}
{"input": "Really cool bar with a nice staff and awesome ambiance.\n\nI live nearby and it's my go to neighborhood spot. It can easily get to be a pricey experience if you aren't careful, but you get what you pay for! The quality and variety of the beers are great. They come in a range of prices, strengths, and styles from breweries all over! The prices aren't even that bad when compared to how much these beers would cost at a \"classy\" place in center city.\n\nThe food is great too! I'm a big fan of the burger and fries."}
{"input": "We attended a private party recently.  The appetizer, cheese ravioli, was good.  That is the only good thing I can say.  I had chicken parm and it was awful.....I actually got a piece of grizzle I had to remove from my mouth. And it was soggy. The red gravy was among the worst I have had EVER.  And the pasta was overcooked.  I could not eat it.  A friend who also attended had the same opinion and did not eat the entrée.  I have heard negative comments about Andreas for years now.  Unfortunately this was my first time eating there.  Needless to say, we won't go back.  They should shut the place down."}
{"input": "Close to the University is this great Chai Tea provider as well as great London Fog options. Any of their hot beverages are best enjoyed during your stay because the paper cups render the beverage a paper taste. The pressed wraps are quite filling, however their chicken dishes are undersized (there isn't enough nann bread or rice for the amount of chicken provided). On my many occasions to this venue, I have seen many first dates here. The music can be rather intrusive, however, the second floor provides a decent sanctuary for studying. \n\nThere isnt much light after the sun sets, and you can ask the cashier behind the counter to turn them higher. The chairs are usually soiled with light crumbs and some of the black seats near the window are kinda broken."}
{"input": "Great  breads especially the German rye. My favorite breakfast is the poached eggs, cooked perfectly. For lunch, I go for the eggplant panini or  Laurie's salad."}
{"input": "Came here for breakfast for the first time a year ago.  Went here again last week.  Still very good!   Food is delicious, and the coffee (capuccinos, lattes, etc.) are outstanding.  Not too hot, not too bitter, and the milk is incorporated into the coffee just right.   Will definitely come back the next time we visit Santa Barbara."}
{"input": "Wow!  This is THE place to be in Clearwater Florida!   The atmosphere, the music, the food, the drinks, all awesome and even better considering it sits 5 feet from the ocean!  Definitely the place to stay if you want to have a rockin' good time!"}
{"input": "The delivery would bring me the wrong pizza and of course it's with the 2 toppings I despise the most. Just my luck. #alwayscheckyourpizza #whatsinthebox"}
{"input": "I stopped in Henry's for coffee with friends on a Sunday afternoon. I didn't try any of their food, but the coffee was good, the atmosphere was nice, and, miraculously, it wasn't packed on a rainy day. One thing that seemed odd for a coffee shop--the acoustics weren't great (lots of echoes from kitchen, other customers, music, etc.). Throw down some rugs and this would be a nice spot to catch up over coffee or get some work done."}
{"input": "Ordered here tonight and now regretting it as I sit here with chills fever vomiting and upset stomach! NEVER AGAIN!!! \nI ate the clear soup, crunchy rolls and teriyaki chicken\n:((( never ever again"}
{"input": "We always check Yelp before trying a new place.  Based on the reviews I saw here we were quite surprised with the meal we had.  Young waitress was very polite and accommodated our time crunch as we were trying to catch a show-the food however was pretty disappointing.  The sauce was very watery and the vegetables in the two dishes we ordered were frozen vegetables.  Watery spicy sauce on frozen vegetables- eh."}
{"input": "I love Icesmile! They are really new to the Tampa area and they already have a huge following. For around the same price as frozen yogurt, you get to try Thai style rolled ice cream. This store is so trendy, it feels like it should be in New York City. they have a ton of different flavor and topping options. They also offer discounts quite often. The only suggestion I have is that they add more seating inside!"}
{"input": "Their kitchen is open until 2am in Old City everyday, need I say more? Their food is great and they have a wonderful beer selection. I'm definitely a fan and will be returning anytime I'm in Old City. Also get their sweet potato fries, some of the best I've ever had!"}
{"input": "Staying around the convention center has it perks, unfortunately trying to find a good bite is not one of them. Luckily, I did find this place, thanks to Yelp! Cute spot, tasty food, and yummy drinks. Sweet tea with orange and mint is very refreshing - I will be stealing that combo. Tried Papa's French Toast, which is coated with corn flakes - stealing that idea too... After the iced tea, it was a must to try their fresh squeezed OJ (divine). They also squeeze their own apple juice! Can't say nicer things about this place... You wont be disappointed..."}

{"input": "Checked in on a beautiful Thursday morning for my honey's birthday.  Had a masseuse come up for her gift massage while I sat out on the parapet reading, next to a hummingbird nest in the adjacent tree (two eggs the size of Tic Tacs). Then we went out for First Thursday Art Crawl (way too many people) and dinner. Back to the Eagle, where we turned on the fire and got into the hot tub.  Very quiet and pretty room, great ambiance, enjoyed breakfast in bed the next morning. Finished our visit by taking two of their bikes on a ride along the beach before the crowds descended."}
{"input": "This is a great Gold's Gym location. It's a smaller gym, which I like, and is not intimidating at all. The staff members are very friendly and welcoming. The trainers are also available to offer help or educate you if you ask. The locker rooms are clean, and maintenance is usually preformed quickly on broken equipment."}
{"input": "Great pizza and fun place to go to. Love the fact that it's BYOB and the service is very well trained. Enough options to have you torn between a few so be prepared to over indulge. From the perfectly plated antipasto, the house salad,  house-made Caesar, tomato and mozzarella with balsamic, roasted red pepper appetizer and even the MEATBALLS (omg how could I forget about the meatballs and that cheese!) #MustTry\n\nThen the pizza, what can I say it's world-famous. With roots dating back to 1897 how could it not be perfect! Well done, thin crust, fresh mozzarella, and light sauce. The toppings, like they said in the neighborhood back in the day, \"fughetta 'bout it\" Meatball, pepperoni(so good), panachetta(omg), sausage(yes), pesto and more... You can get a calzone with, you guessed it, any of those fillings. \n\nPasta dishes are new and come with a salad and dessert. Unbeatable for the price up Passyunk Avenue. Go in and check it out, by far my favorite pizza place on the ave.-so unique."}
{"input": "Haven't been to a Philllip's in a long, long time. So when work took me to the Sheraton in Philly I thought it was time to reacquaint myself with my childhood seafood place... Bad idea.\n\nThe crab cakes I remembered as delicious morsels of ambrosia turned out to be overly greasy, too little crab, and much too little taste. At least they were edible. The grilled snapper (fish of the day) and asparagus that I got on the side were overcooked and drowned in butter as if this could hide the unmistakable blandness of the food.\n\nI was quite literally crushed. Hoping this is was symptomatic of the location and not the chain. Will have to try the one in Baltimore and pray that it lives up to my childhood memories."}
{"input": "Great drinks, food and atmosphere! A little loud if you are trying to eat out with a group of friends, but still a great time! Love the tropical touch!"}
{"input": "Food was good, but overpriced.  Sandwiches came with stale chips.  Although we didn't try any, the beers may be good, but a glass of the house chardonnay which was sweet and simple was $8.  Likewise, mixed drinks were $9 for a small drink.  Our tab for 2 was $85 with tip and included 2 sandwiches and 2 drinks apiece.  Nice atmosphere, but won't be a place we visit often, if we do indeed return."}

{"input": "We stopped here for post-dinner drinks after eating at Bridgid's. I can't speak to the food (since we didn't order any), but the bar was pretty nice. We got there at around 10pm on a Saturday night and it wasn't that busy. We got a table near the bar and had plenty of room.\n\nThe beer selection was good (a requisite for me). I got a Brooklyn Pilsner and enjoyed it. The service was OK - a little slow, but the waitress was pleasant. \n\nThe only thing I wasn't crazy about was that there was a table with middle-aged people making out right next to our table - I mean really making out, not just like a kiss here and there. I found this to be somewhat egregious. This is really not the restaurant's fault, but I just figured I would mention it so if it happens to you, I can say 'I told you so.'\n\nOverall, I would consider coming back."}
{"input": "This has been a favorite shopping place for me, but NO MORE.  They have consistently raised prices with quality going down.  Have found NOTHING the last several times I've been there.  Small Christmas decoration .98.  This is a thrift store not Dillard's.  Customer base has changed drastically.  Will look elsewhere."}

She loves the special role she plays as Doula to laboring woman!!  She finds beauty and strength in that magical time.\nBec would be a great addition to your support team!!!"}
{"input": "My husband and I took my mother here for her 100th birthday!\nWe can't say enough about the treatment we received: from a great table and view, to delicious \"compliments of the chef\" extra dishes, to a beautifully decorated cake plate, to the warm and attentive servers. It was much more than we expected, even for this very special occasion. For us, it was a wonderfully memorable experience."}
{"input": "This is my dry cleaner. The lady who runs it is very nice and always gives my kids tags and stuff to play with. The dry cleaning is as good as dry cleaner can get. The only downside is the price but I guess you pay for location and this place is right next to my house. Also I haven't really price checked around so I am not sure how this one really compares to other dry cleaners. \n\nFunny tidbit the same lady who runs this dry cleaner used to run the dry cleaner in my old building at Parktown place in center city. Small world!"}
{"input": "Finally got a chance to try this place and I'm so glad I did! I went for the elote (Mexican corn) that I heard about and was happy that it was just as tasty and delicious as any I've had before. I also tried a couple tacos, they have a great selection with all different kinds of meats. Staff was friendly and the food was inexpensive and good. Not many tables to sit at, but overall a great, quick lunch spot."}
{"input": "We enjoyed this ride during the first week of May.  Captain Mike and his Boston Sidekick were great to be around.  They were knowledgeable about the area and kept everyone happy/entertained.  The boat was fast and when it turned, passengers could be seen feeling the effects of the G's.  In total, it was a great ride with a fun crew.  We would definitely recommend this ride and do it again."}
{"input": "Standard Subway, nothing special. Fast, friendly service. They have gotten rid of the Monterey Cheddar bread though, so that sucks."}
{"input": "I have been to some of the best sushi restaurants in and out of the country and I've got to say - Incredibly Amazing is the best way to describe Ginza. The food is always fresh and delicious, largest sushi rolls in town, and the best Hibachi grilled shrimp and chicken. Talk about a hidden Gem!! .... Don't forget to try the pomegranate wine."}
{"input": "Above average steaks - great service - excellent wine list.  Comparable to Ocean Prime, Ruth's Chris."}
{"input": "Delicious food. All the food is made to order fresh as it can be. The service is fast and really friendly. If your a grilled cheese lover and quesadilla lover this is the place for you. The soups are made fresh everyday and is different option everyday. We will be coming back."}
{"input": "Great little find, right by the hotel we stayed in. The service was prompt and very friendly. The salad was delicious. Very clean, nice atmosphere. I was not disappointed."}
{"input": "The rooms are nice but unfortunately it's a bit loud. Even with an alley room the street noise is very clearly heard at all hours. \n\nGreat location and friendly staff but the walls are thin. Parking is also a bit difficult. Even the lot the hotel sets you up in is about a block away."}
{"input": "Clearly, the word has been out about this breakfast spot for a long time... and while we waited in line like everyone else does when they come here, it moved surprisingly fast. They offer up cups of coffee for those waiting outside, and thankfully we had an unseasonably warm December morning.\n\nThe prices are cheap, the staff is pleasant, and the pancakes? Well, they were fantastic. And I'm not much of a pancake guy. Their fried eggs and sausage patties were both enjoyable as well."}
{"input": "Went all in on a triple after walking around for a few hours on a relatively crisp evening, and didn't regret it at all. Wasn't overly impressed, but certainly solid product."}
{"input": "The ambiance is pleasant, welcoming, and clean. Sabrina's is a stylized balanced blend of modern and eclectic decor. The service is timely and inviting. Hands down a must stop for delicious food on any road trip or just a hungry night out. Definitely meets up to the 5 Star rating!"}
{"input": "Horrible!  I heard good things about this salon and went in last year before vacation for a gel mani and regular pedi.  I purchased my own tools so that I didn't have to worry about contamination from other feet.  The technicians kept using old files and buffers despite the fact that I paid for my own tools (and purchased them from their salon).  When I tried to tell them I had my own, they didn't understand (language barrier) and I had to keep calling over the manager.  I did not want to seem annoying but I also did not want to get an infection.  Well.....\n\nMy gel mani chipped within 2 days of being on vacation and I got a fungal infection on two of my toe nails.  NEVER, EVER again!  I never go to nail salons for this exact reason and not I am stuck with fungus.  Please do not go to this nail salon."}
{"input": "Horrible service and food. Service was terrible. The management staff seemed to congregate at the wait station and chat with the servers in an unprofessional manner. At 8:30 on a Friday night the clean up guy was dragging rug mats thru the dining area."}
{"input": "Good but maybe a little over hyped. I got the Brussel sprouts and the shrimp and grits. The sauce on the sprouts is overwhelming. It was like eating spoonfuls of bbq sauce. Too sweet and too spicy. And the shrimp and grits was better, but also saucy. A little goes a long way."}
{"input": "Food is very good, lovely interior......but...without question among THE most indifferent service I have experienced, from the hostess to the person handling my carry out order.\n\nIn order to get to this establishment, I have to walk by or near Flatwater with excellent and healthy food prepared by fun and caring people, served by people who show enormous amounts of enthusiasm and gratitude for my business....and the same is true for Patachou....Bazbeaux.... Geek...\n\nDo these folks understand I, and others, have choices ?\n\nI don't get why people can't smile and act as if my business is appreciated ???"}
{"input": "Hi there!! I highly recommend this restaurant food is so good especially the chicken is the bomb..."}
{"input": "Just went for my first appointment here and was really impressed by the practice and office. Dr, Biscardi gave me the most thorough and, well, kindest, eye exam I have ever had. I am so happy I found this place thanks to Yelp!"}
{"input": "I can't believe I have to give a star.  Quick rundown.  I ordered:\nsingle with no ketchup, mayo, or mustard with med fried and large unsweetened teas\ndouble with everything lg fries large coke\n2 5 piece nuggets\nside salad\ncheeseburger kids meal plain with oranges and vanilla frosty.\nOk now for what I GOT:\ndouble with bacon, no ketchup mayo or mustard, lg fries, coke\nsingle with everything, lg fries coke\nhamburger kids meal with fries and coke\nright around the time I said no ketchup a blank look came across the face of the employee.\nThis is not rocket science."}
{"input": "I am really sorry for writing this, but I have been to this place a couple times in which I had ok experiences. It rarely gives you a good-looking manicure. \nHowever, today's experience was awful. She gave me 10 different nail shapes, no hand lotion, nothing. I still have my cuticles, and am very upset. I'll stop going to this place. Although it is a beautiful salon with lots of polish options, I don't think they have many professionals."}
{"input": "First time here.  I got the green curry with tofu; my husband got the thai fried rice with chicken.  Both were wonderful and perfectly spiced.   I also got the thai iced coffee (a tad too sweet).  Service was quick and our server was pleasant.  The only reason why I didn't give five stars is because of the price.   There are no lunch specials on the weekend and $32 for a quick lunch was a little high for us.  Of course we could have left but we chose to stay so I'm not complaining, just letting others know."}
{"input": "these people are great.\nthrough the years we've experienced everything and seen probably every doctor. these are true animal people, through and through, and you can always count on them for the best. not much else to say!"}
{"input": "This place has similar concept as Chipotle but you only get 3 add ons after that you have to pay extra for even lettuce and onions. I would say it's just a glorified overpriced Chipotle."}
{"input": "This is a great little brunch place near the WWII museum. We had a 20-30 minute wait, but it was worth it. I had the crab omelette and Julianna the breakfast grits. Julianna's was by far the best, but we enjoyed both very much."}
{"input": "Hot Stuff is pretty good. Another reviewer said that it isn't that hot on the Nashville hot chicken scale, and I agree. I requested the hottest they got and it rates about a regular hot at Prince's. Not entirely a deal breaker for me, as the flavor is actually really good.  In terms of flavor, I like Pepperfire, for heat, 400 degrees and Prince's (and very surprisingly Wingbasket). I have yet to try Bolton's but I plan to very soon. \n\nThe guys at Hot Stuff also have hot ribs which seems really interesting, and I'll review again when I get around to trying it. They also have hot chicken salad, so if you're into plants and all that, there it is.  The menu is a lil diverse, so unlike the original hot chicken joints, this place has fish and ribs too.\n\nAll in all, it's good when you're on the south side and want some hot chicken.  It's not the hottest chicken, but it's still good.  Ordering is best called in."}
{"input": "I have only been here on a few occasions, mostly to send the random package, I like that this location has one of the automated machine (the post office closest to me does not...)\n\nBut what I wanted to highlight was the fantastic customer service my husband and I experienced when we went here to get our passport applications submitted, the representative we worked with was awesome. She was fast, friendly and knew exactly what needed to be done so we were in and out super quick! She even gave me the follow up forms and explained what I would need to do once I changed my name, perfect. I hope every experience here in the future is just as good. She should train everyone."}
{"input": "Loved this place. I saw this place on food network and it lived up to the hype. They have so many good choices. I had the fiesta dog and it was great."}
{"input": "This was one of the greatest meals I have ever had.  The food was delicious and the hospitality was second to none.  The lamb was cooked to perfection, the rice had the perfect amount of spice.  The ability to easily describe the amount of spice made this meal perfect for spicy lovers, but also easy for those with a milder pallet.  All of this is from someone who has historically not been a fan of Pakistani/Indian food.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone and would encourage a trip to St. Louis just for the food here."}
{"input": "The food here is great and the service is good too. They don't have great selection for vegetarians. However I was very happy when they were able to make vegetarian dish just for me but be sure to call ahead and ask. The bread is in fact as delicious as it sounds! My boyfriend and I have been here a couple of times and always had great time thanks to the atmosphere, yummy food and good service."}
{"input": "I stop here fairly frequently to pick up a few items on my way home from work.  Because of the time of day, it is usually busy, but it's not too difficult to find a parking spot.  It is the traditional Acme/supermarket (not the cheapest, but the sales are good).  The workers usually say hello to me throughout the store which is nice, and they almost always have what I'm looking for.  Their greeting card section is a little sparse, but you can usually find something to fit the bill.  Overall, if you're in the area and need a place to go grocery shopping, this Acme is pretty solid."}
{"input": "I didn't care for this place at all. I heard that food quality has drastically decreased since Katrina but man...  I don't know what sauce they used for the ribs, the fish and chicken were underseasoned to me, and the etouffe was watery, red beans and rice were... I don't need to go on. :("}
{"input": "I really want to like this place-- the decor is great and the food looks amazing. The rustic looking flights are really neat touch. But....the wine is TERRIBLE. Even for a Pennsylvania winery (which really has summers that stay too consistently hot to produce great vintages), the wine is not good. I've been here twice and gotten flights each time, so I've tasted a wide range of their product, and it goes from mediocre to awful. Taste or Black Walnut are much more worth your time and money."}
{"input": "New to town and tried several in town but no availability on a Sunday. This place was open when I drove by so I stopped and they had a opening after 20 min wait. Pedicure was ok but gel nails horrible. Looked like fat marshmallow nails and so bumpy. Went to another salon few days later. Run down older salon. Needs lots of improvements especially learn how to do nails. Paid extra for opi nail polish instead of old nail polish they had as a selection. Waste of money and time."}
{"input": "Really great place for wine!\n\nCame here with my dining group, there was about 20 of us on a Friday, for their Happy Hour. Excellent wine happy hour where all glasses are $5 or you can take $5 off any bottle of wine, which is a great deal if you're sharing with a few people...great way to try a few bottles.\n\nThe food was also great! Cheese plates are the way to go here! Excellent selections! Several of my foodie friends ordered sandwiches, which looked & smelled amazing! They all raved about them!\n\nThe ambiance is very warm and inviting! They do a great job decorating, especially around the holidays! My favorite space is the enclosed patio area, adjacent to the main dining area. Super warm and romantic on those cold winter evenings! \n\nThe service is great as well!"}
{"input": "This was one of my two life-changing culinary experiences, and yet it was cheaper than many other Nashville restaurants.\n\nThe chickpea fritters and rabbit cavatelli are good but not spectacular.\n\nThe chicken liver mousse and especially the braised lamb are to die for.\n\nI can't wait to find an excuse to visit again! Meanwhile I need to shave a star off my past reviews."}
{"input": "This place really isn't that good. The atmosphere is sweet, but the food is mediocre at best. I'm always disappointed when I type in middle eastern and this pops up as the best available, it's definitely not."}
{"input": "These guys do good work, on time, and warranty their work.  I would highly recommend them!"}
{"input": "First word! Amazing... The owner 'Hasan' is an artist. My husband had a bad cold but wanted to try cafe's lassi... Hasan made sure my husband not only enjoys the Lassi but also catered his sore throat with a medicinal combination. It tasted amazing.\nI wanted a spicy Chaat... Its been ages I had such a perfect chaat... Spice, taste and innovation all came together. Must say, have never had such a chaat even in India. \nI wish we had one in Milwaukee. We will make more trips to Philli again to eat in ur cafe, Hasan Saab! :)"}
{"input": "Due to the nature of my work, I have to be a lot more aware of my personal appearance.  So I've given up on the Supercuts, anything that advertises itself as a \"salon,\" and (unfortunately) my wife as my cutter.\n\nThus, I have been visiting various true barber shops, much in the same way that I seek and try out coffee shops.  And my experience in getting haircuts has been much more pleasant.  Oxford epitomizes this.\n\nI got a very good looking haircut, at a reasonable price, from a friendly barber who really took his time to give me the haircut I really liked.\n\nThe place it tough to get to, in the vicinity of the Vanderbilt hospital, but if you can find your way clear, and need a manly cut, this is a fine place to get it done."}
{"input": "I thought they had closed shop when I learned they were no longer at their old location. When we saw they had only moved we had to try them out in their new down town location. I don't the know owners name but he is the nicest guy. Very friendly. The food was delicious but it might have been wise for us to confirm what we thought we were ordering. Indian food is delicious but I am horrible at remembering what I ordered before. Unfortunately this review is another victim of my not being able to remember the names of what we ordered. One dish was mostly spinach (a total hit), another was some red chicken dish (perfectly cooked but looked like it was dyed red), and naan which is everyone's favorite. If you know your Indian dishes you won't be disappointed. Kids are always welcome there. Be sure to enjoy downtown while you're there."}
{"input": "We wanted breakfast at 10:30 am on a Friday, so we used Yelp and went to this place.  It was exactly what we wanted.  We sat outside on the patio and enjoyed the weather while eating our food.  The Make your Own Hash was so good, I practically licked my plate clean.  I also tried the wheat toast with homemade strawberry jam.  It was tasty.  I wish I could take a jar home with me.  We might even return tomorrow for breakfast again.  The only reason I could not give them 5 stars was the service.  It wasn't bad, just nothing impressive."}
{"input": "Terrible establishment.  Poor service. The bouncers do not have any restraint. If you are female they will grab you aggressivley. ..very hostile. I have had a few terrible experiences there and I share them with everyone I meet so they know what they are getting into when they go there. Don't waste your time or your money when Nashville has so many other awesome places to offer!"}
{"input": "My first time ever to this diner on a weekday. As soon as I entered in this diner it felt like entering in someone's home. Its a cozy diner with very friendly servers. There are so many good diners in the area and this one is def one of the finest. The serving sizes are huge. The omelettes are great, I didn't try anything sweet so can't say how were the pancakes or French toasts. But the menu has so many different options and they all looked very good specially the sandwiches. I had an egg Benedict which was ok, nothing wrong with it but nothing great either, portion size was huge. My wife had an omelette with onions and American cheese which was very good ( again I liked her order better than mine lol). You pay the bill at the counter after you finish eating . I would go back again and would try other things on the menu."}
{"input": "I came in here to get Halloween Party supplies and am super happy I did. I have shopped here in the past and experienced overly high prices for products that have poor quality. The items I picked up today ( about 10 items) were priced perfectly. I spent under $10 for all our items. As great as the prices were today the selection of Halloween items were poor. I wish Party Fair offered more of a selection. They do however, have a large selections of balloons and themed party items."}
{"input": "Tried a Flat White for the first time on the recommendation of a friend (Thanks Amy P!) The first location I went to said no, I couldn't because they were out of whole milk. This location though, they were more than happy to oblige. The service was quick and efficient. The barista was both bubbly and sweet as she made my drink order. \n\nThe drink itself was tasty, not sweet but rich on the tongue. Next time I get this, I'll see if they can add vanilla to it."}
{"input": "Insane!   The best foodie joint I've eaten at for fast casual chain....   Burgers are amazing!! But you MUST try the onion rings....."}
{"input": "Another wonderful stip mall ethnic restruarant!!! This was my first time at a Veitnamese restuarant and I will say that pho is a little bowl of heaven. It was warm and fragrant and with all the condements they bring on the side, easy to customize. We also got BBQ pork sandwiches and they were very tasty. The meat was tender and flavorful and they had fresh herbs on them and some kind of yummy sauce. They only take cash, so make sure you hit the ATM before you go. The food is very reasonably priced though.\n\nThis restuarant started my love affair with pho, but I haven't had any as good anywhere else in Nashville."}
{"input": "A good red sauce kind of place, third time I have been there and everything was very good, I will say the service is kind of slow due to not enough servers but it was a Thursday night so I will cut them some slack for not being busy and only having one server , but if it was a Friday or Saturday night I would not have been very happy to wait as long as we did for our meals, but everything was very good and will be back,"}
{"input": "Run by the same people as Knifewear next door, this is definitely a \"man's store\" stocked with every kind of shaving supply imaginable, particularly items for straight-blade shaves. There is also a large selection of axes and knives for camping or outdoor work. The staff seemed knowledgable and friendly. A great place to get gifts for the men in our lives."}
{"input": "Topa topa, amazing open space with great beers. The Weekender Session IPA is my favorite beer in town!! I love the open tab system!!!\n\nHowever... if you sit at the bar there is a serious bleach smell that is overwhelming from the glass dishwasher. I'm not even sure bleach should be used in a high temperature dish cleaner, since the high temp kills the bleach...hope they can fix this, it's a major turn off when you're trying to enjoy the smell and taste of your beer."}
{"input": "Skip it! Not worth the $27.50. The cruise itself is really boring; all you can see is trees on the side. The narrative tells you it was a battlefield and there are two plantations and colonial buildings as well but you can't really see them. There is Domino's sugar refinery and a huge natural gas plant - all steel, nothing really to see or enjoy. The steamboat doesn't give you a special feel, it's like riding on any other boat. The music is really good indeed -probably if they didn't have it, nobody would come."}
{"input": "If I could select less than one star I would. Completely awful. After calling multiple times and no one answering, I finally was able to talk to a very unhelpful employee. He emailed me a specific unit, price, move in date and application. I filled out the paperwork but was unable to find the specific unit he indicated. When trying to call about my problem no one answered for 2 full business days. Then when talking with another very unhelpful employee, she told me that unit was already gone & suggested other units more expensive & not in the move in date discussed. When asking if they would honor the price originally discussed in email correspondence, they would not. Long story shorter, I cancelled my application & just wasted $50. This business only cares about money & does not care about the tenants at all."}
{"input": "This hotel was ok for an overnight stay.  It was decorated nicely for the Christmas holiday.  Upon arrival into the lobby, it smelled delightful as one walked in, a very clean smelling and neat, well-kept appearance for an older hotel.  \n\nThe room was an ok size but the beds were a bit tight.  It just seemed like they were full size beds and not queens.  Also the bathroom vanity seemed a tad bit oversized for the space.  It felt cramped while using the bathroom.  There isn't much room to move around in the bathroom, and with the vanity and the door in close proximity it would make one feel claustrophobic.  Other than that it was nice.  The staff brought extra towels and washcloths upon request, and the front desk followed up by telephone to make sure housekeeping brought them.  That was refreshing.  Overall it was a pleasant stay."}
{"input": "So lets see.....80's music and dollar sake night or poledancing show nlght...its a tough choice.  I have never had a bad night here.   Don't let the building work fool you--  it is open."}
{"input": "I was so excited when this place opened a few years back.  For some reason, it took me forever to get there to try their stuff.  All and all, it's ok.  The bagels are not great - do yourself a favor and go the bagel factory about a mile down the road.  They have authentic NY style bagels; this place does not.\n\nThe doughnuts are good - not great.  Somewhere between Dunkin' Donuts and a true bakery type of taste.  If you are going to partake, go with the maple bacon bar...it's the best on the menu.\n\nBottom line from me, no on bagels...meh on doughnuts.  I'll probably be back, but would not seek it out."}
{"input": "This small but impressive sidekick to the much larger, and more lavish, Oxford Exchange makes a quick, convenient alternative to those who want something good to go in a hurry.\n\nThere is limited seating inside and the menu is not nearly as extensive as its namesake but there are plenty of of satisfying ways to appease your appetite, sate your thirst for iced coffee, get a boost from a juice or make a baked good grab and go.\n\nBe sure to peruse the chilled section for all sorts of ready-to-eat goodies.\n\nOxford Exchange has been a maverick at shaking up the status quo and this tiny countertop - and counterpart - carries on that tradition quite well."}
{"input": "On the plus side, their food is consistently good and their service, in the restaurant, is good. Opportunities for improvement:  their prices are a bit high and their cheesesteaks could have more meat to be at the same standard of their other menu items.\n\nAlways friendly service, which makes any meal taste a little better!"}
{"input": "Absolutely delicious food every time! So fresh and so reasonably priced!! First place I come to when I come back home to New Orleans!  Love it!!! Friendly staff and awesome atmosphere!"}
{"input": "The Ox Tail pho was legit! The portions were perfect and the small family business feel to it made the experience better! The price was right! I know their dipping fish sauce was homemade, as it was super delicious! We have a place to come eat every time we get into Reno!"}
{"input": "Sushi eaters beware. My family and I just ate here. My family ordered cooked items off the menu, and they were fine. I, on the other hand, ordered a sushi bento box, and the sushi made me incredibly ill. It did not taste bad, but the fact that I got sick made this a 2 star experience for me. I am not new to sushi at all, and frequently get sashimi at other restaurants. This time, however, my stomach is killing me. If you come to this restaurant, make sure you get cooked food."}
{"input": "Probably the best thing about Target is that it isn't Wal Mart.\n\nTarget is awesome because it has everything from clothes to toys to electronics to makeup. \n\nI usually stop in here (if I remember) to pick up my makeup, because it's at least $2-3 cheaper than other stores.  They have a great grocery section and their selection of household items (microwaves, etc.) is fantastic.\n\nThey are always good about having enough registers open for the number of shoppers in the place, and I rarely have to wait in a line."}
{"input": "We've stayed here a few times over the years by virtue of having family in close proximity. The staff is invariably courteous but I have to confess that the place has seen better times. The carpets are beginning to get a bit ragged as is the furniture. On our most recent sojourn, the water would not drain from the bathtub - the lady in the reception was kind enough to find us another room but the room smelled strongly of frying oil (!)........ given that it was way past our bedtime, we chose to keep the room. Think the innkeepers need to up their game a bit here..."}
{"input": "I didn't discover this place until a few months ago, even though I live less than 5 minutes away. It's tucked away in a small strip mall right off of Hwy. 70, behind TJ Maxx. It's definitely a hidden treasure and probably my favorite thing in the Bellevue area. \n\nI'm a big fan of their vanilla bean lemonade (try it - you'll like it!) and their cakes/cupcakes. My personal favorite is their Margarita cake - it's just wonderful. They also have really good vegan and gluten-free cupcakes, with plenty of flavors to choose from. \n\nMy mouth is watering just thinking about their Margarita cake and vanilla bean lemonade... :) \n\nI've tried their sandwiches and lemon-artichoke soup a couple of times and they're alright - just not my thing. I think it's kind of expensive for what you get, so I just get dessert when I go there now. \n\nThe interior is super cute and a perfect place to have lunch with your girlfriends. It does get crowded fairly quickly and parking can be at a premium during lunch time, so plan ahead."}
{"input": "Hrm. I HATE to bad mouth a place which is obviously a small business and in a super competitive market. But this order was .... problematic. \n\nListen, they totally got the basics and cheaply too. Pork fried rice, excellent.  Crab Rangoon,  over cooked, but fine. In fact, anything premise and deep fried was exactly as you'd expect.\n\nBut the award winning Whole Chicken Pad Thai is just one giant green pepper disguised as noodles and nuts. It's not just bell peppers -- it's spicy hot, even though it wasn't marked that way -- and they marked half the menu as spicy.\n\nI bought $50 worth of variety and opportunity,  but I'm left wishing I'd stuck to the super boring stuff you can get anywhere.  *sigh*"}
{"input": "I love Olive Garden! Best appetizers. Consistently good service for the most part. Surprised the reviews are bad. Usually get to sit in a booth or at a big table. That new stuffed chicken was not that good. The new tortellini appetizer was very good. Very good lasagna and chicken parm."}
{"input": "Top notch food. I ordered the 3 course meal and everything was beyond super deliciousness!!! Our waiter Jenna was amazing, knowledgeable and fun. She made our experience sheer perfection. I can't thank the staff enough for making my birthday dinner heaven on my taste buds."}
{"input": "Awesome place, if you follow their instructions you will loose weight and get healthier !"}
{"input": "Not really sure what all the hype is about...wasn't overly impressed with the food. I suppose if you are a beer snob, one may appreciate this place. However, most bars are catering to beer snobs now and nothing about this place truly stands out from the other local bars..."}
{"input": "I've stayed in the old tower in a jacuzzi suite and in the new tower in a regular suite. They are excellent rooms with plenty of attention to detail. The rooms are comfortable and if you get the choice, stay on the Mt. Rose side (it's a great view to wake up to). Be careful with the wet bar as the sensors are very sensitive. I made that mistake when looking at a bottle of water. \n\nThe spa is definitely something to check out if you're out with a group or just as a couple. We spent an entire day relaxing in Spa Tocana. While it's small, it has a great staff that is very helpful and the non-chlorinated inside soaking pool was very rejuvenating. The spa also has a good view of the mountains and also has a view of the pool so you can keep on eye on your kids (should you bring any)."}
{"input": "If you go make sure you order something with the carmelized bacon, it's wonderful.\nThe shrimp salad sandwich was very good as was the BLT. The brunch items looked good and the service was attentive. \nIt's BYO and there is plenty of parking in the Spread Eagle Village lot. Would absolutely go back for lunch or brunch. \nWill try it for dinner in the future and report back."}
{"input": "Huge fan of Total Wine and the huge selection of items.  Prices vary from $4 bottles of wine all the way up to out of my league prices!  :)  One thing I despise about this store...the parking lot shopping center traffic to exit.  Holy mother this shopping center drains every last bit of patience out of me as you will sit in bumper to bumper traffic waiting to exit.  I am tempted to park across the way and cross crazy traffic instead of parking here but I don't want to look like a lush crossing a busy intersection with all of my wine!  So if someone could pleaseeeeeeee find a way to fix the crazy traffic...I would visit here more!"}
{"input": "Always so fresh, fast and consistent. Everything on the menu is incredible. Great service every single time too. The establishment is always extremely clean as well. It really is a gem, tucked away in that strip mall. They even have a rewards card for those who eat there as much as I do - really great place, kudos to the owners. Great stuff."}
{"input": "2 solid putt putt courses. Probably the best ticket prizes this side of the Appalachian mountains as well. Go Kart track isn't to shab either. The arcade games are pretty solid, but often are being repaired. Like most arcades in the land, Great Times could use a fresh coat of paint. But WHO GIVES A RIP! Support a solid arcade and  potentially meet a super cool mega babe who wants to play Tekken or House of the Dead with you until closing time over a tasty Coca A Cola Icee. Just saying."}
{"input": "The food for most part has been consistently good.  The service however has been all over the board. Sometimes they are very good, other times they are the worst. It's a crap shoot with them.  Also, NEVER pay by credit card when placing an online carryout order here. Since they don't verify orders/info when people come to pick up carryout orders, there's good chance a crook will have come in and snagged your already paid for order."}
{"input": "This was my first ever escape room experience and I absolutely loved it! I came with a group of 6 of us (which is the maximum per room) and we all had a blast! The owners of the place are super friendly and very knowledgeable do they were able to give us a brief history of escape rooms. You can tell that they want everyone to enjoy the experience as much as they did when they did their first escape room which is great! I would highly recommend this place! It is relatively new but I think it'll really take off over the next couple months!"}
{"input": "Let me start with the positive. The staff and customer service here is exceptional. They will go out of their way to make things right for you and accommodate your needs. However, the hotel facilities they have to work with is in dire need of renovation. The shower in our room dripped all night long; the toilet would not flush properly; consequently it repeatedly overflowed; the tile in the bathroom was broken in several places and dirt had accumulated in the large chipped areas; the facing on the bathroom sink had a huge crack and the toilet paper holder was falling out of the facing; attempts to fix the facing was evident by spackle smeared near the crack and gloves of glue around the toilet paper holder. The furniture in the living are was visibly soiled and the lamp shade in the bedroom was broke.  It's unfortunate that Hilton does not renovate this hotel. The staff was awesome and it would be a shame for them to lose business due to the outdated and falling apart facilities."}
{"input": "5 stars all around. \n\nFood was delicious, ingredients were fresh, service was friendly and fast, price was just right for the quality of the food and service."}
{"input": "Great burgers,fries and salad!  Burgers have a hint of salt and pepper flavor.\n\nThis location is very quaint. They only have outdoor seating\n\nFriendly staff.\n\nStreet parking as well as parking lot in the back."}
{"input": "Went here for lunch today. Waited an hour to get in. After waiting for our food another hour, we found out they misplaced our lunch order from the manager. She offered us coffee/beverages while we waited for our food. Food portions were large, but food is probably 3.5 to 4 stars. Found out they ended up charging us for the coffee we drank as we waited an eternity for our food. Also, the waiter in training spilled water on my friend's foot. Ugh!"}
{"input": "The concierge at our hotel recommended this restaurant after we asked for a creole restaurant nearby.  My friend and I both had the jambalaya and fried catfish and were both sorely disappointed.  The catfish had no flavor and the jambalaya was dry and lukewarm.  The atmosphere was no better.  Our server was nice enough.  I give it two stars, one for the service and one for the free cornbread with honey butter sauce."}
{"input": "Best damn breakfast I've ever had. We had the roast beef debris biscuit with cheese sauce on top And stuffed French toast. The fruit was the best fruit I've ever seen and the homemade whipped cream on the French toast was out of this world. Fresh squeezed orange juice and a latte for the perfect end to this meal. We will be back!"}
{"input": "Just had lunch there, ordered the red bean and rice meat lovers classic. It was had good flavor. The portions are huge for lunch and the prices are great. Just wished they had more dinner items on the lunch menu, was craving pasta - none available on the lunch menu."}
{"input": "Replaced a dive watch battery in less than 5 minutes for a very reasonable fee.  Prompt, friendly service.  Plenty of staff.  Convenient location."}
{"input": "This was nothing special and seemed a little overpriced for quantity. \n\nIt's a typical diner/cafe.  All American (and the decor will not let you forget that).\n\nThe food was not memorable and I think there are better breakfast places on the east side.  But if you are in the area and don't want to look elsewhere, swing on here."}
{"input": "The food is amazing! Fried pickles and the smash fries are so good!! The customer service was horrible though."}
{"input": "If you are hip and into Mid-Century Modern goods - and being green, you have to check out TFA.\n\nIt is like a big ball of Mid-Century Furniture, Clothing, Jewelry and what-cha-ma-call-its all in one place. It is a great place if you are looking for that truly unique gift. \n\nWe have purchased several items and we love visiting!  They are super nice and very helpful.   It's too bad my friends in Cali can't enjoy this place - they would eat it up."}
{"input": "This place is the best.. Bob Diehl is a straight forward honest man. \nHe has past his talent and character on to his sons.  \nHe has done B service on my 430S and taken care of a broken gear shift.\nThey get things done as promised, quickly and correctly for 1/2 the price..\nI have referred two other Mercedes owners to Bob and they called to thank me for the introduction to Bob and the Stuttgart Autohaus.   Mike"}
{"input": "I love this place, the best day is Thursday for dollar tacos. The people who make the food are so nice and they know what they're doing and they make excellent food. If you go in there and you want the \"Plan B\", ask them to make it in a wrap for you and it tastes even better. Breakfast is only until 11 am so hurry! BEST IN HYDE PARK!!!!"}
{"input": "This is only based on breakfast. The selection is limited. I was hoping they'd have beignets. In lieu of that, I got coffee, fruit, and bacon - sweet and salty. The coffee was great. The bacon and fruit were sad for $5 each. The bacon was scrawny. The few berries weren't sweet, and the melons were under ripe. As with the hotel itself, the staff were rather muted - not especially helpful or friendly.\n\nIf it's raining outside and you're getting ready to leave, stay here for breakfast. Otherwise, go out."}
{"input": "Just got my delivery of honey BBQ wings, a sampler, and whole cheese steak. Quick service delicious choice for a lazy day. \n\nWings were really meaty and saucy. Bonus\n\nSampler came with a little bit of everything. Bonus is the variety of sauces to dip with. Thank you!\n\nCheese steak - was jot my meal but from the look of it the bread was freshly made as described by other yelpers. \n\nThis place is a neighborhood gem. Glad I found it!!!!"}
{"input": "Great storing coffee and amazing grilled croissants! Even the fruit was great! Affordable and good food."}
{"input": "This place is ok but is far is gambling goes your better off anywhere else I've spent thousands of dollars at black jack and craps table extremely hard to win at this casino, but the food is good and room are reasonable price."}
{"input": "If you are going for the food, I would give it 5 stars, but since this is a brewhouse, I only gave it 3. \n\nI ordered the light flight since we went for lunch and I wasn't looking for a heavy meal. The beer was OK at best. It was bland, a little strange in after taste and uninspired. Light beers dont have to equal tasteless. My boyfriend had a \"hoppy beer with citrus undertones\". He could taste neither the hops or the citrus  (disclaimer - we are from VT and are used to very hoppy beers!)  \n\nNow the food - that was great. We went at lunch time and was able to get a soup and salad for 8.95. We both had the same thing - Chicken Bruchetta salad and French Onion Soup. The portion was fantastic for a lunch size and the soup really flavorful! \n\nFor a lunch downtown it was great, but I would go for the brews..."}
{"input": "Good food, family ok, kids love it\nChicken buffalo\nPastrami \nRecommended\nTake your time at lunch need 30 to 40 min"}
{"input": "I love Ethiopian food so I was really excited to try this restaurant out. The food was good but I was a bit disappointed with the doro wat which is my favorite dish. I felt the chicken was not as tender and a bit dry. Their cardamom iced tea was very good. Service is friendly and attentive."}
{"input": "A truly unique and lovely find.  Green grass, a sandbox for kids, train tracks with the Amtrack Surfrider streaming past, and ocean view just past the rocks.  Usually, places with great views & ambiance have sucky food- this is NOT the case here.  Great burgers, medium rare, and the shakes (choco fudge, caramel, Oreo) are too delicious!"}
{"input": "Love this place!  Started being a fan in LA over 25 years ago. Food is still great and the prices still reasonable.  Wish they would open another location in Santa Barbara. I can feel a double-double calling me now."}
{"input": "My friends at work (connoisseurs of good food in the St. Louis area) introduced me to yet another very nice restaurant and that's Brio's!! I like everything about it - starting from the complimentary bread and chips to the bruschetta, pasta and salads !! Beautiful place.. The service adds to the charm !!"}
{"input": "With all the options available for antique shopping this place is prob my favorite. Friendly help is available when you need it and not when you don't. The selection is priced well and vast, I would highly recommend coming in and spending some time just browsing their shop. Support Fountain Square!"}
{"input": "My iPhone 5 was having trouble charging. I had tried cleaning the connector myself, but the problem was getting worse and worse. \n\nI assumed I needed a new dock connector. I had read that the connectors were easily damaged. I call several iPhone repair places. Most quoted $60 or $70 for the repair. iDope quoted me a very fair price of $46. \n\nOnce I arrived, the technician did a thorough cleaning of the dock connector. He pulled out all sorts of dirt and fuzz that had accumulated from a few years of living in my pants pocket. He plugged it in and voila! It was charging again!\n\nHe handed the phone back to me.  No charge!\n\nThank you to the honest and fair, iDope!"}
{"input": "This place is wonderful! Obviously the chips, salsa and beans are yummy, but get the guacamole too! The chimichanga bites are fantastic, whatever the sauce is that comes with them is super good! For dinner, the street tacos are amazing, so are the enchiladas. They don't have a full bar, but you can still get a real margarita, and they pack a punch! They make them at their other location and bring them over, which is clever, because this location doesn't yet have its liquor license. Overall 4 out 5 stars because it's a good Mexican restaurant, but 5 stars is reserved for my most favorites only. Close second though, and we love that it's right downtown. Oh, and the service... very good! We usually always have the same server, and she is very nice and attentive."}
{"input": "This place has great donuts and sliders. Kids wanted to come back the second day. Wish we could take some home but the fill up before we go will have to suffice!"}
{"input": "Location of this place is awesome.  Right across the street from the beach and close to state street and some nice wine tasting rooms.\n\nThis place not be what you expect when you pull up because it looks very motel-ish.  The rooms are very clean.  They have a nice little pool area.  They have wine and cheese at night and breakfast in the morning.  \n\nNothing is amazing at this place, but nothing was horrible.  For the price I would definitely stay at this place again."}
{"input": "Ru San's is interesting... to say the least! My wife and I are regular sushi eaters, and we always somehow end up back at Ru San's (I am beginning to think it's because it is close to where we live).\n\nPositives:\nThe menu is extremely creative and gargantuan! I love that they have some cheaper options, and plenty of variety.\n\nNegatives:\nRu San's has the worst service I have ever had. On a typical dinner night out with my wife (even on odd weekdays), it has taken us over 2 hours to get out of there. The waiters seem to either disappear, or have so many tables that we tend to get neglected. On many occasions we have set at our table without drinks and with requests for more than 30 minutes before finally flagging down another server to find our server.\n\nThe food is good, but seems to take a longer time to come out than usual places. They have recently raised their prices a little, so be prepared to eat $50 worth of sushi!"}
{"input": "I'm not into beer so I can't speak for their product, but I had a very good lunch there one weekend. My friend's pizza order got mixed up and our wonderful server took a few bucks off (even though the pizza was still delicious)."}
{"input": "I love the concept of this place. One half of it a café that serves different types of coffees and teas, and breakfast type items, and the other world where it serves bar type apps, salads, and sandwiches,  Can't forget that they also serve a wide variety of beers that they serve on tap, bottled, or in can.  \n\nThis place is pretty darn casual, and one can hang out here for hours with their friends.  Reminds me of the good ol' college days when no time could pass especially on a chill out Sunday Fun day.\n\nBring your four legged friend too.  They are totally welcome."}
{"input": "The 30th Street Cosi doesn't feature anything special that sets it apart from any of the other Cosi locations in the city (say, Rittenhouse or 36th and Walnut), but it works for when I'm en route to the train and craving a hot drink or something to munch on and a WiFi friendly spot if I have time to kill.  My usual if I'm sitting in for a meal is the pesto chicken melt or a chicken margherita flatbread pizza, but it's highly unlikely that will happen at this Cosi.  Only if I miss my train...."}
{"input": "I can't say enough about the shop - clean, friendly and professional.  Stacey has done my eyebrows & eyeliner plus a few tattoos on me.  She is friendly, flexible and comes through with some great designs off my ideas.  Jamie is great too - her work is amazing."}
{"input": "Amaziiiiing... Their food's really good but the all you can eat buffet is such... A great deal! Awesome food but they should work on the service. Staff seems so shy n very quiet."}
{"input": "I work in the shopping center and was eager to try the new restaurant.  I didn't expect it to be so amazing! The atmosphere is really nice but it's the food that really hits it out of the field.. I had the Penne Sausage and it was probably the best pasta dish I have ever had.  My boyfriend had the Alfredo (which of course I tried) and it was delicious, creamy and buttery. I very much enjoyed the house salad. Don't change a thing! I could sit and eat that bread and olive oil all day if you let me =P\nBig portions, great service.  I really hope they stick around!"}
{"input": "If I could give this place more stars, I absolutely would. I am a sucker for businesses that brand to a T. I loved the stamped napkins, plates, to go cups, and more. Everything about this screamed adult tea party, and I couldn't  get enough. Don't let the price hold you back. It is well worth your hard earned dollar to indulge in this delicacy. I recommend the red velvet cake. It is to die for!"}
{"input": "Loved this place! I have never been to an ice cream parlor in which they had Sweetened Condensed Milk as a drizzle! Ever since I was little, my dad got me on putting condensed milk on fruits, cake, crackers and smoothies. I didn't think anyone else knew about this until I came here! I just HAD to get it on my ice cream so I chose the strawberry shortcake with the toppings of graham crackers, whipped cream and strawberries. With of course the condensed milk as my drizzle all for $7. Can't beat that. Employees wore gloves and everything looked clean. Delicious will be coming back and bringing my dad lol."}
{"input": "3.5 stars because they don't serve alcohol (and I was in dire need of a drink after a veryyyy long week). Get the margherita pie - it is delicious and fresh. Also ordered the Greek salad for an appetizer which was filled with yummy veggies. Yum."}
{"input": "Always eat here when visiting Nashville. A great burger joint.... and the truffle fries are the bees knees! Sláinte!"}
{"input": "This might be my favorite coffee shop in the city. The food is unbelievable. Anything I have ordered has been fresh, delicious and so enjoyable. The place has a cool edgy vibe and lots of comfy seating and some great seats outside when the weather is nice. Definitely worth checking out especially if you want a some food as well."}
{"input": "Easy glide into Tuesday evening. Cooler Buddies DIPA capped with the Shade Tree IPA. Fold in a perfect playlist and you're good to go. Love this place!"}
{"input": "I LOVE This Restaurant!!!! It may not have the widest selection of food, but the fries are off the chain! And the drinks are marvelous!"}
{"input": "This place never disappoints.  Even though they didn't have the seafood listed on the menu for our dish,  the substitutions might have been better. Since it is a tiny place there is sometimes a wait...  But it's well worth it. As always,  the leftovers were just as delicious..."}
{"input": "Tried a bunch of items, everything was great!!  Loved the deep fried steak!  Will definitely be back the next time I am in Reno"}
{"input": "I absolutely LOVE the convenience of having a groomer come to me instead of dragging all my dogs to a groomer.  The price of grooming is very competitive to other groomers in the area, if not a bit better.  So, how can you beat that!?!\n\nI pay $60 for my 65lb dog, and $40 for my smaller dogs.  This includes a bath, ear cleaning, nail grind, and anal gland expression if needed.  All of my dogs are short-haired, so nothing too fancy.\n\nMy only drawbacks are:  no teeth cleaning; the price is the same regardless if the dog is 5 lbs or 40 lbs; and the feeling of judgement for not taking better care of my dogs (but that could just be me)."}
{"input": "Oddly enough this is a decent location. Free multi floor parking was a plus in case of flooding. It has a decent gym, and a nice upstairs pool. Relatively easy on-off highway. A $14 Lyft to French Quarter's canal street. Concierge is minimalistic and oddly located in open area in front of elevators. I like the elevator key lock to the top floor.  \nBut for some weird reason the prices in late October are rising above French Quarters, which I presume is a micro-market in Met'ree (that how they say Metairie ;-))"}
{"input": "Yes, yes, yes!! So happy there is an authentic Greek restaurant in our new neighborhood. Looks like it's been here for ages. Best part - it's BYOB! The food is fantastic, we ordered melitzanosalta which is eggplant basically baba ganoush. Along with classic roasted leg lamb and octopus, both dishes were fantastic, very legit traditional. Can't wait to go back again - also very affordable for the portions."}
{"input": "Ah, Wissahickon Trail ... I want to set up a tent and live on you forever. Seriously, you made me forget all about the screaming kids from my neighborhood, the wretched stench of the city on a hot day and, well, pretty much anything else discomforting about city life.\n\nWhat more could I ask for from a life partner?"}
{"input": "Awesome little shop.  The owner really knows his stuff and you can tell he loves his work.  They have tires and other parts you won't find anywhere else."}
{"input": "This is Indian no place. How can you charge New York valet rates. $32 for overnight car parking. Ouch! \nOther than that this place rocks! Great location!  Convenient to the convention center, sports venue's, Museums, Zoo and IUPUI.\nI'm a runner and loved the proximity to the outdoor canal. Which is great for walkers and runners.\nGreat views from the rooms and very clean.\nStay here and you will be comfortable and won't regret it."}
{"input": "Great pizza and fantastic wings. My only complaint is the bottle sodas come on get fountain drinks already and I would eat here more!"}
{"input": "I can only comment on the vermicelli bowls because I have never had the Pho. \n\nThe vermicelli are a decent size and a fair price. Conveniently located if you live in the Alberta Ave neighbourhood, my orders have always been ready in 15 minutes - even on a Friday night."}
{"input": "Great wings and atmosphere!! Gone quite a few times and have received consistently great service, beer, and food."}
{"input": "Everything I had was amazing! We ordered brisket plate with corn bread, coleslaw, Mac and cheese and potato salad. I don't usually like potato salad but this was really good! Mac and cheese was good but could use some more spices. Brisket was tender and easy to eat."}
{"input": "I love F&M but last time I went, my roast beef sandwich had meat that was not fresh (it was completely brown), with a pre-cut pickle that had skin that was shriveling around it. No bueno but I had already drove 15 mins before I opened my container - not about to drive back.\n\nOther than that, they're great! A bit expensive but the only deli I'd go to in the area. For two breakfast sandwiches it can get close to $15 but they're filling and delicious. Never had a problem with their breakfast sandwiches and despite my experience above, I'd go back for another roast beef sandwich. If my next experience is a good one - I'll up them to 4 stars."}
{"input": "It's a good restaurant, french cuisine, high end service, looks good inside. So normally I would give 4stars. So don't get me wrong, but as a gluten-free person, it's a real dissapointment. 7 out of 10 dishes have gluten (mostly or breadcrumbs or soy sauce) that can't be removed from the dish. They also do not have glutenfree bread to start off the meal. Nowadays alternatives are so easy to find by using tamari sauce or amino acids instead of soy sauce. Even the redwine sauce had gluten, it is very easy to make that without gluten. Last time we were there was 3 years ago, I think it will be another 3 years at least if we come back at all."}
{"input": "This is a great laundry. There is somebody on site from 8a-7p 7 days a week if you have questions or need help. All laundry soap etc are sold onsite and there are 2 big change machines that will change up to a 20 dollar bill. I had 2 king size comforters and other bedding to wash so I opted for both 'big Bertha' machines. There is an assortment of machine sizes and everything is well marked.  You can also have your laundry done for you if needed including comforters.  Not great seating but doesn't really matter unless it's packed."}
{"input": "I'm usually at Ulta shopper but since moving to the city Sephora is perfect! They have so much stuff you could spend hours here! They have all your cosmetic needs under one roof! And you have plenty opportunities to sample anything you want!"}
{"input": "The shrimp po boy was completely off on proportions. The bread was super thick, hard and chewy and I threw away half of it because who can possibly eat that much bread in one meal. The shrimp was good but skimpy portions. The creole sauce is  good too. I would not get it again."}
{"input": "I thought I would stop in for a drink and a pizza. Happy hour timeframe. Go to bar and order a sapphire martini straight up with olives. Bartender asks me if I want vermouth? I have never been asked that question before but I told him dry. Also said if I wanted straight gin I would have just ordered it. He tells me it is South Jersey and they don't like vermouth. No idea what he is taking about. Too much vermouth but drink it. Order marinara pizza. Sauce tastes good but no garlic at all but ok for happy hour. \nSecond time here and just don't like the place. Staff acts superior and food is not as good as N Broad street restaurant. That place at least has some flair."}
{"input": "Enjoyed a company corporate holiday party with 2K+ people in the Tuscany Ballroom with an overnight stay in the Tuscan Tower.  By far the very best resort in the area delivering a cruise ship like first class experience.  I don't smoke and didn't notice the typical second hand casino smoke.    \n\nBonus was eating breakfast in the coffee shop with the Peppermill CEO/GM John Hanson pulling up a seat next to me at the counter engaging in friendly conversation about my stay while enjoying his breakfast.   Doesn't get much better than this folks."}
{"input": "Truly, I cannot say enough good things about this tiny, authentic, perfectly delicious eatery!  Growing up in the panhandle of Texas, we had plenty of authentic Mexican food in our home, and I'm always searching for good Mexican restaurants. El Limon is the best I've ever had in the state of Pennsylvania!  Sopes, tostadas, enchiladas, fajitas, burritos, fish tacos....all excellent and sooooo reasonable!  Waitstaff is always pleasant and attentive.  Best two features: homemade tamales and free margaritas!!  Bring the entire family for an amazing Mexican feast!  Ole!"}
{"input": "We have big group of 12 for the office outing lunch. I would said for the number of people we have, the service is not the best but good enough. Only one of our members get the food late. The close out may need to work on it. Tip was added since we have large group which may my bill easy. \n\nI have order the lamb kebab (Shish Kebab) plate. It come with two choices of side. I got the rice and the babaghanoush. The rice was well cook and nice aroma. The babaghanoush was well prepared and great with extra olive oil. The presentation of the dish is pleasant. However, the meat did not measured up. It was too dry and the marinated is not over the top. They need to improve on this area. \n\nI have been here several time. My previous experience is better. During the month of Ramadan, they serve the buffet that are plenty of choices and attractive. I would said try them during this time. The buffet of Ramadan usually start at 8:30. Go early because is a lot of customers."}
{"input": "Average at best. If this restaurant wasn't connected to the hotel I'm staying at I wouldn't eat here. I've tried both the breakfast and lunch/dinner menus and so far haven't been impressed with either. The crab cake looked like a burnt hockey puck and the breakfasts I could make myself. The French vanilla iced coffee literally seemed to be black coffee with ice that I had to add copious amounts of cream and sugar to. Lastly, I got my order to go but I'm pretty sure the waitress who took my payment gave herself a tip for mixing my gross coffee since she short-changed me a dollar and two cents. I would've tipped her $2 but she  apparently helped herself which I don't like unless being notified of automatic gratuity."}
{"input": "Once again do not ever, for any reason, shop at Mattress Firm....after reading my review Mattress Firm commented on it, apologizing and asked me to contact them so they could make it right. I immediately contacted them and of course have not heard back after over a week. This company has no desire to make anything right. As I said in my first review not only do they have an \"F\" with the BBB, take a look at all their reviews on the internet. PLEASE spend your hard earned money with a company that deserves it."}
{"input": "WOW!  What a fantastic place!  Food A+, Service A+++  We started with an appetizer of cheese curds served with a red pepper jelly.  LOVED IT!  I ordered the fish tacos and the wife ordered a beer brat for dinner.  We both thoroughly enjoyed what we ordered!  The portions were huge and priced just right for the portion size.  Our server was on it!  Very attentive and was very knowledgeable about the menu and made us feel very welcomed.  The manager stopped by and asked how everything was.  I let him know that I am pretty sure I have found a cool new place to hang out, have a beer and watch football.  He said they have great deals on game days and let us know about their brunch on the weekends.  Everyone said goodbye as we walked out and reminded us to grab a rootbeer candy on our way out.  I will be back!"}
{"input": "$30 pedicure for an average job. Nothing special, no flower or anything, and some of my toes aren't even fully painted. Plus, they just blend in the color if it gets on your toe, they don't even try too hard to get it off. Won't be coming back."}
{"input": "So everyone is entitled to a bad day but I must say, 97% of the time this place is a well oiled machine! Love Sockeye!"}
{"input": "I've tried many ice cream shops in New Orleans and this one has made it to the top of my list. It has by far the best ice cream in town. \n\nAs soon as you walk through the doors you take a step back in time. It reminds me of many hollywood movies based in the South- it definitely has that old world charm. \n\nThere are so many delicious flavors to try and it's usually hard to choose just one.  However, over time and many flavor tests I find that I tend to gravitate to chocolate flavors. My personal favorites at the Creole Creamery are the entire chocolate section  (located on your left as soon as you walk in); more specifically, the chocwork-orange (a dark creamy chocolate ice cream with a hint of orange flavor), the butterscotch english toffee (soooo good) and lavender honey (who doesn't love lavender?)\n\nWhat's your favorite flavor?"}
{"input": "This place is sadly perm closed. I was hoping not, however the phone is now disconnected."}
{"input": "Finallly. After searching the town for some good eats we found a place. In the east side of Nashville a foodies hideaway you will find Batter'd. Took my wife for her birthday to have sushi. It was outstanding. The place is a small house with a lot of atmosphere. The staff was great and very attentive. This is definately on my places to go back to in Nashville."}
{"input": "Great food. Stopped in for lunch and was served quickly and the food on point. If you like greek food, stop in you will certainly like it more than the chains or any place in tarpon."}
{"input": "Oh my gosh, coolest optical place ever! Completely different frames than what are normally available at your optometrist's office. If you're a fan of the retro, cat-eye 1960s look, SEE is absolutely necessary! The frames aren't cheap, but well worth the price. Huge selection, attractive displays and helpful staff. I wish I could give SEE 10 stars!"}
{"input": "We recently had our car serviced and the staff was friendly and efficient. I was taken care of by someone right away. Quick, nice and fair. What more can you ask for!  Great people and great service."}
{"input": "Great place to get a diner plate lunch like meatloaf, jambalaya and poboys. Real cooked food not processed foods.No fancy but good food fast."}
{"input": "Why is it that ALL Anthros have dressing rooms that seem lit by a candle on the verge of flickering out?  The longer dresses on the first floor are usually amazing.  The rest...well, there are no must-have items anymore. Lack of essential wearability/usefulness seems to be hitting a lot of women's clothing stores these days."}
{"input": "This is an East Nashville mainstay.  They have an authentic Boston-style fish & chips that is excellent.  Also poor a great Guinness!"}
{"input": "I wish I could give this zero stars, this gave my husband and kid a really really bad stomach ache after eating here. This used to be our favorite Chinese restaurant but not anymore. Never eat here. Also on another note the delivery really slow."}
{"input": "We had just come from a terrible experience at El Molino down the street, and saw this place and decided to take a chance on them, and boy am I glad we did! Very professional and friendly, dressed to the nines (they had some sort of news team recording while we were there), these peeps know 3rd wave coffee! I had a perfect cappuccino, and delightful convo with the dapper dude at the bar. Probably the best coffee experience we had in Tampa, highly recommended!"}
{"input": "We ate here while staying at the nearby hampton inn and suites.  Large menu, food was all fine.  Big portions."}
{"input": "Great service. My husband ordered a cheese and bacon burger and I got the crawfish sausage por bo both well made and great tasting."}
{"input": "I thought the food was good.  It's the average Mexican restaurant in Nashville.  They have about the same menu as anywhere else and they don't try to be something they're not.  It's a small building and has a weird layout but I could care less about that.  There are probably cheaper places but this is convenient for me because of location.  I didn't drink but I saw a few drink specials that I'll definitely check out in the future."}
{"input": "I was in town for business with myself and a couple of co workers we were looking for a good place to relax and have some ice cold beers. Came across The Craft House on Yelp and we were very pleased with the awesome craft beer selection they have! I tried the Hop King Imperial IPA and it was fantastic! The bartender recommended the new shrimp po boy sandwich and it was delicious reminded me of a po boy I had in New Orleans. We played some pool and had a great time. I will be returning to The Craft House on my next business trip this coming summer. Thanks for the great food, beer and service!"}
{"input": "Open air to the street is nice.\n\nTables are WAY too small and cramped together. Service was especially slow with half the place empty.\n\nBacon blood mary had a funny taste to it, I probably got a bad batch.\n\nFood was decidedly mediocre.\n\nNothing I can really recommend about coming here."}
{"input": "Lunch special is a great deal. Jaguar roll and Shrimp Tempura roll were fantastic! Best sushi place in Indy."}
{"input": "This was our first breakfast stop on our trip to New Orleans. It was great! Being gluten free and vegetarian the Migas was awesome. Maybe the potatoes were too spicy but besides that everything was so good. Try the cheesy grits. Love the decor too."}
{"input": "comfy place with good egg sandwiches and really amusing bathroom graffiti"}
{"input": "The burgers were good.  I loved the quiet atmosphere; we went on a Monday at 5.  My boyfriend had a shot of whiskey that he enjoyed.  Overall it was great."}
{"input": "As a first year beekeeper; I researched online and read as many books as I could for close to a year before actually getting my bees. And even after all my research; I still find that I have questions. And whenever I stop by Isabees; Jane, Scott or Kat have always been VERY helpful answering my novice questions. They have an excellent variety of merchandise on hand and always take the time to answer my questions. Never any upselling; just always pleasant conversation and exchange of ideas to get me exactly what I need. Keep up the good work Isabees!:-)"}
{"input": "This review is for both Sea Landing and Santa Barbara Jet Boats (we checked-in Sea Landing's building, but our jet ski rental had a label for \"Santa Barbara Jet Boats\"). All the staff members that helped us including the girl that booked our reservation as well as checked us in, the dude who gave us the safety and boundary spiel, and girl who got us our wetsuits, life vests, and launched us into the water were all very nice and chill. Took us like 5-10 minutes to check-in and get prepped before we were on our jet ski and out on the ocean. We paid $135 for 60 minutes of use. We got the 1-3 person Yamaha WaveRunner jet ski that can go up to 55 mph. That thing can really fly. We were only daring enough to take her up to 33 mph max out there, but if you got the guts, you can definitely max her out to fully make your money worth it. Nice people working there and easy process to go jet skiing."}
{"input": "We started with the artichoke dip, big mistake. It was cold and the chips were stale. Mentioned to our waitress, but nothing came of it.  We ordered a large pizza, thin crust which after adding toppings it was a bit pricey for pizza.  Pizza was ok, not great. Except for not being our advocate our server was good.  I have been here before for Cardinals game, it was better then. Will try another venue next time."}
{"input": "When I ordered my pizza for me and my friends , he pizza was so small and this delivery girl took forever and she was rude and didn't want to give me my change back and she said she thought I gave her a tip no ! And she didn't even give me the right change and it was all coins ! This place sucks ! DONT EAT HERE !!!!!!"}
{"input": "This restaurant has definitely seen better days.  Pricey, attitude, garish recent redecoration, terrible food.  Too bad, because for years it was a quality, friendly, well-managed place--best in Harahan.  Bring Rodney back!"}
{"input": "i just love a good burger!\nits done right if its cooked to the perfect medium I ordered.  patty was thick and juicy. fat was dripping out.  thousand island sauce adds to the extra fattiness. bun was lightly toasted and oily.  everything was fatty!\n\ntator tots was soft and crunchy and, again, greasy.\n\na little on the greasy side for me....but for others, thats what it is all about.\nive had burgers multiple times this week, and within the week, the village burger was the best of the ones i had"}
{"input": "Excellent food. We tried three appetizers and five entries and all of them were a hit. This prices are reasonable and the service is good. I'd go back again and again."}
{"input": "Excellent amount of food with their early bird specials from 2-5pm. Food was average at best. People were friendly and everything was clean. Prices were pretty good"}
{"input": "This place has everything you need for buying gifts, and plenty of stuff you don't need (or didn't know you needed until you see it). It's got all the knick-knacks a person could ever want, which makes it the perfect place to purchase fun gifts. From candles to jewelry, locally made shirts and wallets to posters, prints, and coffee mugs, this place is the perfect place to peruse on a visit to Mass Ave or the perfect spot to stop for a gift for a host, birthday, graduation, or anything else. \n\nI was tempted to think that I'd be able to find things in the store that I wanted and order them online cheaper, but Silver in the City already has good prices (with shipping, few things were cheaper online). I love it here!"}
{"input": "I don't shop here often but I do so when it's the garden-planting season and thus I'm ga-ga about getting some flowers into the ground. So I'm always in a good mood when I go to Albrecht's. They have a good supply, although the gardening equipment seems quite expensive."}
{"input": "We love this movie theater/ bar/ restaurant. Great drinks, friendly service and good food.  We can only recommend this place!!"}
{"input": "Due to it's location in a strip mall near Cool Springs, this version of the Twelve South hipster gourmet Burger Up is certainly not as trendy. But it makes up for it by delivering the goods. Awesomely tasty and messy burgers with fresh meat and fixings. The regular fries are delicious... until you try the truffle fries. They are truly outstanding, not greasy and finished with paresan cheese. The metaphorical cherry-on-top was the chocolate milkshake (which actually had no cherry on top). The shake was nothing fancy, but perfectly made, creamy, not too sweet or over-chocolatey. \nIf you want your upscale burger experience but still want your burger-fries-shake holy trinity, come here."}
{"input": "The smoothies and bowls there are good. I have already been back. It was just that I wanted a larger smoothie size. It's just a suggestion to management. I don't get smoothies from any places that add sugar or artificial ingredients. So, understand that I did enjoy Karma but just wanted a larger drink. We were walking around downtown and it would have been nice to have it."}
{"input": "Omg, my favorite lunch spot around here! I could eat here everyday it is so tasty! Great service, a bit small but still nice to eat in!"}
{"input": "This place is awesome! The mimosas were strong, the chicken and waffles are hands down the best I've ever tried, and the coffee was perfect (i also had the Smores latte and my tastebuds were very happy). The only downside is that the wait was pretty long but well worth it. Best of all, it's right around the corner from the angel wings mural so during the wait we stopped by to snap a photo."}
{"input": "Best chicken you could ever hope for in bourbon st. The chicken is good. The sauce is good. Everything is goof"}
{"input": "Always get the egg rolls and wonton soup on my way home from work. The generals chicken and fried rice are my favorite entrees."}
{"input": "Went for lunch today(Sunday) and sat at the bar.  That was a big mistake since it was not that crowded and we could have sat at a table.  They had one bartender for a large bar and she was doing drink orders for the rest of the place also.  It took 25 minutes to get our food, which was cold by the time we got it.  I am not a big fan of cold fries.  All attempts to get the attention of the bartender prior to the eventual arrival of our foot were fruitless.  \n\nThe food might have been good had we gotten it in a timely manner.  Clearly they need two bartenders or else not serve food at the bar."}
{"input": "Evething about This Resturant is great!\n1- brew there own soy sauce\n2 service amazing \n3- food fresh, creative & amazingly good\n4- everything about this small south jersey Resturant is the best around.\n5- can not wait to return!!"}
{"input": "Today was our first visit.  My husband tried two different varieties of cold brew and enjoyed each.  I had the mango iced tea and the blueberry rooibos.  Both were flavorful and a nice size.  We also tried the peanut butter balls, which are incredible.\n\nThe service was friendly and fast, and the cafe had plenty of comfortable seating.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere and look forward to coming back.  I've never seen any cafe with as many cold brew coffee varieties."}
{"input": "I loved this place, it was my first time coming here with my friend and we both loved the service and how our manicures came out. They made us feel welcome and taken care of. I really enjoyed it and we will definitely come back. We did make an appointment at around 1pm on a Saturday and there was only one other customer in there with us."}
{"input": "The breakfast is always cooked just right and this is a fun place to eat. Nothing fancy just a great place to go. Highly recommended!"}
{"input": "Best pizza, caprese salad and cannoli! I've been coming here for years. The staff is very courteous."}
{"input": "i saw maggie for a lash & brow tint and am super happy with the outcome! she mixed the perfect shade for my brows and now i feel cute without filling them in. great customer service in this store, i will be back!"}
{"input": "We walked into this bar last night - December 12th,  after we were refused service at another bar because of our group size.\n\nThe bartender, who's name I didn't get, didn't blink an eye.  He made cocktails - and put on show - right down to the mocktail we ordered. \n\nWe were out looking for an amazing cocktail experience and he delivered."}
{"input": "Austin  Martinez (director of operations) & Steven (our server) went above and beyond with our table. Awesome guys and great atmosphere. Made our Friday night experience wonderful. My friends and I will definitely be back to this great clayton spot!"}
{"input": "An absolutely delicious restaurant. We all shared and wanted it all. Even the bread was outstanding. I like the BYOB Philly scene since I like my wine and I like to know what I'm getting. The decor was minimal and felt like you were in someone's dining room. Bathroom was clean, kitchen looked very clean as well. Wait staff was helpful and attentive, but not overly so. A table next to ours didn't like their order and it was replaced with something else free of charge. Pretty cool place."}
{"input": "Yes, I feel guilty after I finished eating but that is just for like 5 mins then I just remember how tasty and awesome the burger was. If you are into burgers with a twist I would recommend visiting this place. If you are going during lunch break make sure you pop by early the place is small and fills up quickly."}
{"input": "This place is great. The staff is friendly and fun. My son wanted to try and they got him set and and learning quickly and safely. Will be coming back! Recommend to anyone in the reno area looking for a fun way to spend the afternoon."}
{"input": "Great place to go everyday. I saw huge changes in my strength and flexibility there. All of the teachers are unique and teach beneficial classes. I highly recommend a monthly membership!"}
{"input": "This is a great place to shop and not spend a lot of money they always have coupons and discounts and have pretty good customer service. I enjoy coming here ever since Mervyns closed down."}
{"input": "Slowest service I have ever received in my life. Lunch took over two hours and was just ok. I will never return. It was raining so we picked a restaurant quickly. It was not busy, not another table was seated in our room. No music and our server took forever for everything, menus-15 minutes, drinks-20 minutes, food-30 more minutes, no refills, and it took forever for the check. We left cash because we were afraid to give a cc because it would have taken another 30 minutes to get it back. Skip this place!!"}
{"input": "After hearing good things about the Screamery I thought I'd better check it out.\nGood location and very friendly staff to greet you with all kinds of information about why their ice cream is the bestest. I was able to taste several different flavors before setting on chocolate peppermint. I thought I'd try that Sonoran Chocolate but was told it was quite fiery. Maybe I'll try it on another day.  My final choice was very tasty!\nI wish they offered more flavors but maybe that will come with time. But other than that, it's a wonderful neighborhood place to grab some delicious ice cream."}
{"input": "First time trying this place.  I'll be back for sure.  Everything ordered was very good!  I think it'll be my next stand by, go to place for an inexpensive, good and tasty meal"}
{"input": "Never disappointed at Maynards. Outstanding Arizona wines. The celery bisque and bistro salad made for excellent appetizers. As main dishes we had trout and swordfish respectively. The fish was exquisitely prepared, leaving its inherent flavor come through, not smothering it in sides. To top it off, an outstanding peach budino. Attentive prompt service. Great experience."}
{"input": "My hungover S/O and I thought breakfast at noon would help cure our brown bottle disease, and we were right! I had their french toast for breakfast (delicious), and bae ended up having one of the kids meals (scrambled eggs, bacon, and a single pancake). I always love going there, and would totally recommend them as being one of the good kind of greasy spoon breakfast places that exist in Broad Ripples heart."}
{"input": "Have eaten at this place 3 times. Every time was a good experience for me and the kids. No smoke No noise and good food good service. Maybe because it has always been on a late tuesday afternoon we have eaten there. I have always ordered something different and have been satisfied  and happy with what I got. Definitely will be back to eat there again."}
{"input": "Great cake like donuts and the peanut butter fluff is their best one especially with peanuts. I would say the best local place in the area."}
{"input": "Class, today's lesson is on the compare and contrast paragraph.\n\nThe SB farmer's market is where people actually seem to shop and buy things, whereas the Berkeley farmer's market is really too expensive, and you just go there to be seen.  The SB farmer's market has great musicians.  In contrast, the Berkeley market's musicians must know someone at the Ecology Center, its operator.  The SB Farmer's market is big, while the one at Berkeley is small.  The SB market has parking, amazingly, whereas the Berkeley one doesn't.  The SB market doesn't have small eats yet the Berkeley one does.  The SB market has lots of lovely flowers while the Berkeley market seems to have a smaller selection.\n\nIf you visit SB, the farmer's market is definitely worth a visit.  If you visit Berkeley, go to the Berkeley Bowl."}
{"input": "Stay away from this dealership.  I have wrote about 3 different reviews on their site and I keep giving them one more chance but wont anymore.  My whole family drives Hyundai but constantly they find ways to screw you over."}
{"input": "This hotel sucks! I gave it 1 star because I can't post my review if I don't give . I would give them damn minus 5 star!!! I was almost robbed by two guys in room 4086! I was screaming , kicked the door hardly, for a few mins, but nobody came to help. I couldn't believe those two guys were so crazy, how dare they!!!!!"}
{"input": "Service, parking and location was great. Pizza and salad had great taste. It came out quick and was timed perfectly as we had to get on the road. Dough was okay - hard to eat with toppings falling off pizza"}
{"input": "Really cute wine bar/patio with a store in the downstairs where you can buy whole bottles of wine and cheese, meats, snacks, etc. Very good live music playing in the outdoor area. Decently priced. Not the best location - but there is street parking around. \n\nIt can be hard to find a table because it is very popular but the wine list was pretty extensive so everyone will find something they like. Each glass is around $8-$12. Good cocktails as well if you're not feeling wine. They have a kitchen as well where you can order food but I didn't eat any so can't speak to it. \n\nVery chill place to hang out and enjoy some good wine and good music. :)"}
{"input": "Ate Here Today the appetizers are good. Had the  fried Calamari was very good! I had the pasta an didnt really like it.But ate it it was really  too much garlic.I\"ll come here for the  appetizers!"}
{"input": "Was not impressed with the store. The employee could care less I walked in and needed some questions answered and it was like I was bothering him that I was there. There are other stores so I will try to utilize the Brandon or valrico one although this one is so close to where I live. It's a shame."}
{"input": "We are staying at the Wyndham and it's just about a 10 minute walk to this little beach bar and grill. We were seated fast, and served delicious food. We had two appetizers, Calamari and Crap dip. They both were awesome! Entrees were Ahi Tuna bowl and Grilled Grouper Tacos... you will not be disappointed!! Fantastic food!!"}
{"input": "Very tasty calzones and salads, food is fresh and reasonably priced.  Small, but nice, tap selection."}
{"input": "I've used kathy's airport service for as long as I can remember, almost 20 years I guess. I have never had a problem with them. They have been on time, reliable, and courteous. I guess there are other companies in our area, but there has never been a reason for me to change."}
{"input": "Expensive but great service & food. The ribeye melted in my mouth. The burger was huge & delicious w/ every bite. The bread pudding is everything it's hyped up to be. Definitely go at least once & share some meals w/ friends."}
{"input": "Let me start by saying that my wife and I are vegetarians, so eating most of their more popular dishes isn't possible. But so far what we've been able to eat we've really enjoyed. Our normal visit consist of overindulgence on appetizers. \n\nThe pretzel bites are amazing. Same thing with the grilled brie, apple and honey sandwich (we ditch the bacon...I know, sacrelidge!). But the star of the show is always the fries. We usually get the Smack fries which are outstanding. Also a fan of the fried pickles. \n\nMisses so far have been the veggie quesadilla (bland and ordinary) and the spinach artichoke dip (pasty and again rather plain). \n\nTheir beer and drink selections are wonderful. \n\nOnly negatives in two visits is the sometimes slow staff (even when not busy) and old ass dilapidated parking lot."}
{"input": "My dogs and i love this place!   Always try to go when they have sales going on.  They have a wide variety of toys and are pretty well stocked.  They even allow your pets to come in with you.  The staff is very caring and friendly.  Whenever I have a question about a certain product, they give me a great answer or find someone who knows more about it.  Even though it's a chain store, I feel like it's a nice neighborhood pet store."}
{"input": "My husband Damon and I like to support local stores and establishments when we travel. Supporting the local economy any way we can helps us feel we are keeping real businesses alive. And being business owners ourselves we want all to prosper. So, when you go into this shop you will be pleased to find that all the goods offered are locally made, designed and or manufactured by locals. Its eclectic, and you can find clothes, artwork, food items and other stuff. The shop owner is friendly and smiles easily. We ended up with a dragonfly wall sculpture made from a chair leg, and pens that are space age and unique and were designed by a local gentleman. Check it out :)"}
{"input": "This place is a scam. They serve drinks where you do not taste the alcohol. The bartenders complain about the tip you leave. I've never been to a bar that is so disrespectful to customers. I will never go there again bunch of young kids with no class. Place will be closed in 6 months."}
{"input": "As far as food, I like this place the most among other Indian places in area. Their desserts are the best. I like their Tanduri chicken and all different flavor of curries. People who work here are not the most friendly, but nothing wrong with them."}
{"input": "Love AJ's! They have the best Strawberry Lemonade around town and all they're baked goods and hot plates are delicious! If I could, I'd go here more often! Great selection store-wide of things you don't often find in other supermarkets."}
{"input": "I used to come here a lot. However I will not be coming here very often in the future because the customer service seems to be lacking. My online order did not go through and this was very disappointing, they made me stand in line again and re-order my food and did not offer me any type of discount or compensation for this disservice. I asked to speak to the manager who also did not offer me any kind of compensation. They don't seem to care about customer satisfaction instead they were fine with the fact that my online order did not go through. So if you're reading this Panera please take into account that you should work to satisfy your customers. We order online because we have small kids"}
{"input": "20 minutes to get French fries, with 3 tables full in the entire upstairs. Just saying. No parking, specials were not explained in full after asking, had to go get the waitress for the fries (tried the Parmesan fries and disappointed to see a pinch of parm, not worth), had to find ketchup ourselves, had to get up and ask for a new beer and the tab. There were only 3 tables. We will not be back."}
{"input": "The wife and I have had 3 or 4 pizza's here. In our opinion, we found the pizza dough to have little or no taste. The pizza sauce tastes like it came right out of a can. We generally get a vegetarian pizza loaded but even with all those veggies, there still isn't much taste.\nWe also generally get a side salad with a dressing (dressings seemed to have come out of a can). But even the salads (lettuce and tomatoes) have no spices on them. This is suppose to be a pizza restaurant. Where are the Italian spices?"}
{"input": "I had been stalking food trucks for some time, when I finally landed somewhere that had five all together. Most were selling sample size items for a small prize. At WCTT, you got three tacos for the same prize. Loved, loved, loved them! Served on corn tortillas with meat perfectly cooked, you couldn't ask for more! And friendly service, to boot. If you see this truck in your area, high tail it over there!"}
{"input": "The best little spot for dinner or lunch in Kenner. The gumbo or turtle soup are great ways to start your meal. I firmly believe the turtle soup at Harbor seafood is better than Commanders Palace. If you don't want soup to start look hard at the frog legs. All the poboys are good, the oyster or half and half seafood are the way to go. The boiled shrimp or crawfish are size able portions and seasoned just right. Always take a look at the daily specials, the cooks are always whipping something up worth considering. Lastly Abita beer is always cold and cheap."}
{"input": "Always love going to Whirled Peace! They have a nice rotation of 10-12 flavors and all the fixins. I go there about once a week and have been doing so for months (even in the cold). Great place to get some reasonably priced frozen yogurt!"}
{"input": "Awesome location, good service is why I have been eating there for the past 15 years off and on. Mostly the excuses about the steak is why I have to write the review. I am happy to pay more for good quality steak but don't blame the poor guy that sold it to you !"}
{"input": "Like many other reviewers I passed by this place a number of times before looking it up on Yelp and realizing that I really did need to give it a shot...\nWow... I was not disappointed!\nWe started out with the crab cake appetizer- it was very well portioned (2 large crab cakes) and the sauce with it had an interesting hint of dill (just lovely and refreshing and a little different).\nWe were feeling like comfort food and had the chicken tenders-  The portions were very generous and the food was just solid.  Not fussy or stuffy or trying hard... just good, wholesome and good to eat.\nThe service was fine- however there is only one waitress for the tables and the bar, so i can imagine that if it is full that would cause some delays.  Overall it was just a lovely meal and the prices were unbelievably reasonable (most places have crabcakes 1/2 that size for twice that price)...\nThe ambiance is nice, nothing crazy but it is just a very nice option with reasonable prices and lovely food!"}
{"input": "Awesome wings!!! We had the braised beef tacos, Chile coconut wings, and the pretzels. Everything was great! The beer variety is great too!"}
{"input": "This is the best taco shop ever! The birria is very flavorful and you must try the homemade horchata! The rice is tasty and beans are very creamy.  Every now and then they also have rice pudding and it is top notch!  I go to this little hidden in the wall place every chance I get!"}
{"input": "This is our ( my husband and I) favorite casual dining place. The food is consistently good. Nothing fancy, just fresh homemade food. The Friday fish fry is amazing- better than any I have ever tasted. There are several fish choices, several chicken and beef choices as well.\nIf you are trying to cut back on calories, there are delicious salads and soups. The prices are very reasonable and the wait people and other workers are pleasant and efficient. Try it, you'll like it!!"}
{"input": "This was a very busy place. Was told I had to try this place while I was in St Louis.  I was not disappointed. I got a peach shake that was amazing. The rest of my group tried a number of different options that they all enjoyed.  The wait was a little long especially on a very hot date. The prices were very reasonable.  The ordering at the window was confusing. Multiple windows with not a lot of direction of which line to get in and where to wait for the food. It's a great place to stop if you are in the area."}
{"input": "I've been trying to eat my way around the world here.  Quesadillas aren't quite enough food for me, a wrap is just right, and \"chos\" aka nachos I typically need a to go box.  Very clean store, consistent food, and friendly service.  I think the Far East dishes are a little plain, My favorites are the Pangea (feeds 2), the buffalo wrap, and Thai Peanut, but I've enjoyed nearly the entire menu at some point."}
{"input": "A must go-to place if you're in University City. This place's chaat and lassi are to die for. It tastes fresh and refreshing, and will fill you up. My recommendation for chaat: go for the mild, even if you like really spicy food. It's not because it's super spicy (it still has a kick though) but because the balance of flavors is better with the mild chaat. The spicy chaat, the spiciness overpowers the rest of the goodies and it gets a bit too saucy for me. As for lassis, I've had the mango, rose, and mint - all I would recommend."}
{"input": "Good golly Miss Molly this was some good eats!  Luke always pleases. Service is personalized and sets a bar well above the standard. The fresh seafood bar is da bomb!!  The meal was well prepared and a true delight, served with flourish and fan fare. \"The Ladies' Man\" awards you five stars!"}
{"input": "Lunch special:\nMy wife had the Sesame Chicken, I had the Cashew Chicken.  They did not have Almond Chicken on the menu.  The Cashew Chicken was good, the soup was good, Their pork fried rice awful.  It tasted days old!  The Sesame Chicken tasted like it was reheated in a micro wave which made it doughy!  The place was clean inside but the food....nada!  I won't be going back!"}
{"input": "This was such a nice change from the other restaurants. Simple fresh organic food.  Full coffee, latte, etc options. Sasquatch brew is delicious. Also, very nice ambiance. Casual, relaxed, and comfortable. The owners are amazing and friendly."}
{"input": "Great place. Had the Louisville Slugger cocktail. Abigail is an amazing bartender!\nWe went here after a long bike ride and walk just looking for a cocktail and quick lunch. We shared the brunch special and had the coconut French Toast which was also amazing."}
{"input": "Fun place to dance and get drinks. Bands are good. The DJ is awesome. Drinks are reasonably priced. Good place to check out on a Friday night."}
{"input": "The place for breakfast while in New Orleans.  Food is fantastic and served hot.\n\nStaff friendly.\n\nMore locals frequent than tourists."}
{"input": "This is the worst Chik-fil-A I have ever been to. On multiple occasions I have waited over 25 minutes to get my food. Their response is \"Sorry, we got backed up.\" It seems they are backed up on every occasion. They even have the sandwiches pre-made waiting to go in the bags but somehow, among all 10 employees behind the counter, they are so backed up that a five minute wait turns to a 25 plus minute wait. Avoid at all cost. Much better options at the Union!"}
{"input": "We stopped in for brunch and we weren't expecting the food to be so delicious.  The 3 meat hash was amazing, as was the turkey sandwich and bagel/salmon.  The employees were very friendly and accommodating.  A little pricey, but well worth.  We will visit again if in the area."}
{"input": "Had a great stay at this hotel right in the french quarter. convenient walking to everything on bourbon street and beyond. their continental breakfast had a large variety of items and was free per your stay. great comfy beds. A huge plus was the non-smoking hotel that doesn't allow smoking throughout. Attentive service and wonderful experience. Great ambiance and decor as i loved the courtyard fountain area at night to just relax after a day in NOLA. Bathrooms were a bit small and the shower could of used a door as water splashed out to the main area but overall it was a comfy room. Free wifi and the staff service was impeccable. We had a fuse blown and the repair was done in 15 min. after we called it in. Another plus is the free bottled water everyday as they gave us 2 bottles on the dresser along with 2 in the fridge. Highly recommended for a stay in the French quarter."}
{"input": "We've driven past this place for years and never stopped until recently.  At any rate, it turns out to be a pretty decent little diner with reasonable prices and large portions.   Good breakfasts & great lunch specials during the week.  If you're expecting something fancy or a young hip crowd, it's not happening here.  But if you want a hot, quick meal in a small family type joint then you should be satisfied.  It's a nice option to the ginormous SJ diners that are the norm."}
{"input": "Stand in the line!!! Look. Our trip to Nashville was two months ago and we still talk about it. First, don't let the line intimidate you. There are a lot of bigger parties that want to be seated. To our suprise, they were halfway down the line when they found a party of two- us!! We felt like our name had just been called on the Price is Right. We were quickly seated and the waiter was so friendly and answered our questions with ease. That cinnamon cream is the thing of perfection. Those folks back in that kitchen are doing it!!! The pancakes were amazing, bacon delicious, coffee, eggs....heaven. Change the name to Pancake Heaven! We want to go back to Nashville, but ONLY for Pancake Pantry!"}
{"input": "The burgers were very good very flavorful. I had the El Mariachi. As with what other reviewers have said the portion is not big. But I believe it makes up in flavor. I also have salted caramel ice cream it was very good homemade style. I do recommend the rooster sauce."}
{"input": "Although I love the coffee, the parking situation makes me drive elsewhere. They have some great unique coffee choices and they bedazzle your frothy milk with hearts.  What's not to love about that? Service is always great and the atmosphere has good vibes.  \n\nDelicious breakfast options and the smell of coffee in the air will put any coffee drinker in a great mood.  Not much seating available since the place is always packed. Hopefully, the Hyde park village location will be a bit better. But again, these places aren't meant for a quick coffee grab.  On most my days I don't have time to park a car, walk minutes away, wait in line, wait for coffee and then truck back to car. Same as if it's rainy outside. If your in a rush you will just have to hit up a drive thru."}
{"input": "Sarah is a great barista! She knees exactly what I meant when I said \"that's apple thing. The hot apple juice!\" (Caramel apple spice) This location is very clean, the staff is super friendly. My room mate who worked at Starbucks for several years says the same thing!"}
{"input": "Wait staff is great, food good, music good sometimes....stage eh...., musicians don't dress laid back , crowd diverse. Not that good for dancing"}
{"input": "Excellent food and big portions! The veggie burrito is by far the best burrito I have ever had! Will definitely be eating here again."}
{"input": "Excellent menu with locally sourced food that constantly changes. A delight for your taste buds. Reservations can be hard to get, so plan in advance."}
{"input": "I had an amazingly positive experience here. Dr. Neel and Robin were friendly, knowledgable and exceptionally helpful. They were patient in answering all my questions, helped me pick out some cool Lucky Brand frames and fitted me for contact lenses. The best optometrist I've seen. I highly recommend them."}
{"input": "Booked a 2 Queen & 1 sofa bed suite on the 5th floor for a short stay w/ my family. \n\nApparent the 5th floor suites are fairly newly renovated. It had new modern ceramic floor tile in the sitting room & bathroom, granite counters & new appliances. The bed area had a nice desk, TV & comfy beds with extra pillows.\n\nThe sitting area was a nice, comfortable size with a table, 2 chairs, sofa, coffee table & TV plus a kitchenette with a microwave, small fridge, dishwasher, coffee maker & a small assortment of dishes.\n\nRoom was very comfortable & clean, hotel was clean and was also very conveniently located. City center, Reading Terminal etc was only a 5-10 min walk and the Liberty Bell area was only a 15-20 min walk (with children in tow).\n\nAll in all, definitely would recommend it for the amenities, price & location."}
{"input": "Would give zero stars if possible. Carries literally zero lefty golf clubs for juniors. Does this corrupt corporation think that it's okay to discriminate against 10% of the world population? I will, most definitely, never be returning to this store again. Also, Jared, the man who helped me, was an absolute asshole. Would not recommend at all. Didn't even have bike parking."}
{"input": "love this place! The owners are 3 brothers right from Sicily. They keep their pizzas as genuine and traditional as possible.\n\nYou can't go wrong with a plain pie, but if you'd like a change I'd recommend the Margherita, Trenton, or buffalo! \n\nAs far as non-pizza items I recommend: the Rambino (spinach salad) or chicken melt panini (also can be made as a wrap with fries.\n\nWorkers are friendly and fast. Other reviews have really put the girls down but they work hard to get the pick-out customers in and out and home to enjoy their food! \n\nFYI, I've learned that the tip jar goes to men, not the girls at the counter. Both deserve tips, just be aware of who you're tipping!\n\nThis place is worth a try- you'll be hooked!\n\nNOTE: other Spatola's (there's about 10) were previously owned by these owners but have been sold. Besides the name, they are no long we affiliated with this location. Their Chalfont location is their only one, and this one has the most genuine taste of Sicily."}
{"input": "Went here for the great food I had experienced before. \nAfter HORRIBLE service, flagging down the waitresses, & being told they were out of all drinks except alcohol & water, my friends and I left leaving cash at the table to cover our tabs but did not tip. The staff proceeded to call my boyfriend a nigger & follow my friend outside threatening to call the cops.  I was disappointed in the wait staff but their intolerance & bigotry will definitely prevent me from ever going back."}
{"input": "This is my go to sushi place. it's cheap and the rolls are AMAZING. if you want a new sushi place to try i highly recommend osaka"}
{"input": "Finally warming up for yogurt!!! They have crepes here too! It's awesome come try them"}
{"input": "101 was delightful! Stopped by after working up an appetite running errands in town and we happened to show up during happy hour - two for one drinks (possibly also applies to alcoholic drinks, but we both got boba teas instead)\n\nThe scallion pancakes were a perfect appetizer. They came out hot, crispy, and a little oily, delicious.\n\nThe tonkatsu chicken and fried tofu bao were both delicious. All the condiments on their bao make for a sort of savory, sort of sweet flavor combo (cilantro, sweet sauce, and a few other things I don't remember off the top of my head)\n\nThe popcorn chicken was also excellent. Tiny, very crispy bits of chicken served with rice and a potato salad. I didn't try the potato salad, but heard it was more of a macaroni salad. \n\nI highly recommend Taiwan 101. Food is cooked quickly, staff are nice, and everything I've tried so far is absolutely delicious."}
{"input": "Decided to come by with my niece and girlfriend for late night milkshakes. Let's say from here on out I'll be going anywhere but stargate. When I called in the hostess was rude and seemed annoyed, I was met with the same feeling when we arrived. The hostess seemed annoyed that we didn't want to sit and just wanted milkshakes to go. We were handed menu anyway which didn't even have milkshakes on them. The workers were rude and dirty. I felt like I was in a drug rehab. Not to mention the milkshakes were plain and watery and overpriced. $5-6 a piece. Springfield diner is leaps and bounds better"}
{"input": "Freddy's has the best fast-food style burgers I've ever had. Great toppings choices and fresh meat. Their fries are delicious with their \"fry\" sauce. Their custard is just as good as their food. It's rich and creamy, and did I mention how delicious it is."}
{"input": "It's no secret that backyard bowls is a favorite in town, and with reason.  Their acai bowls are really good, everything is fresh and tasty!  All of the bowls I have tried are great and they can be very filling.  The large is A LOT.  Minus one star just because it's pretty pricey so it's not something I get on a regular basis."}
{"input": "Big honkin' sandwiches that taste the way sandwiches should - really good. Even the tuna salad is good, and that's normally as standard as you can get. My favorite is the veno - hot roast beef bathed topped with lettuce, tomato, pickle, provel, bacon and onion with a sweet red pepper sauce. All this on a dense and chewy hoagie roll. Perfect!"}
{"input": "My party of 2 was seated very quickly, however the service was extremely slow especially for a Wednesday night. Server brought us guacamole so we thought it was complimentary, however when the bill came we were charged $8 for it even though we never asked for it. When we asked the server, she said sorry but did not take it off the bill. Overall, the meal was just average but pretty pricey. The mango margarita was not very good and was $8 and the enchiladas were average but were $17. Definitely won't be returning."}
{"input": "This is my and my husband's favorite place to get lunch. The fried pork gyoza is absolutely the best I've had around town, and I get it EVERY TIME. The place is always clean and the staff is very friendly and helpful. There's some yummy kid's options too, if you're like us and have picky eaters."}
{"input": "Good breakfast. Pancakes were nice and fluffy. Cinnamon roll was awesome. \n\nDenver omlette was ok. Hashbrowns we're just ok, as well. \n\nStick to the carbs here!"}
{"input": "Service is rarely that great.  Food hits the spot.  They also have a few vegan meals on the menu which are delicious!!!"}
{"input": "Went there yesterday (Oct 25) at about 4:00 PM. Had the nitro and it was delicious, hence earning the two stars.\n\nHowever, like *many* other reviewers here, the service is awful. Not only were we an apparent nuisance to the baristas reviewing Halloween costumes with their (boy)friends, but also were treated with, as one other customer said, much shade.\n\nI brought my own cup in which to have my coffee. However, when I asked if she could put the drink in my cup, I received elevator eyes, a smirk, and a clear, \"No\". Ok, I thought, sometimes sizes are difficult to estimate in a different cup.\n\nThen, as we were sitting down enjoying our coffees, I turned around to look at the counter for WiFi info. I received a stern look from the barista, who then exclaimed \"Can I hep you with something?\", to which I responded, \"oh, I was just looking if you had WiFi.\" The barista responded, \"We have a sign, for you,\" again with a plethora of shade.\n\nWill never return, thanks for trying."}
{"input": "It was hot and humid so we came in here to avoid the heat and grab some lunch.  Chicken salad sandwich was very tasty and Kale and Quinoa Salad was enjoyed by someone in our group.  We were seated promptly and served in a timely fashion. Great place to grab a bite while on your feet all day sight-seeing!"}
{"input": "Decent falafel wrap...but not exactly cheap. And the cave-like sitting area was cold and uninviting. There are better choices in Manayunk."}
{"input": "Amazing food. Was quick service too. Had the po boy shrimp sandwich. The atmosphere was great. Need to come back and try the smoked oysters. Would highly recommend."}
{"input": "If I could give zero stars I would.  Service was slow and it wasn't busy. Order came out missing food. Place was disgustingly filthy. And the food....bland and super greasy."}
{"input": "I love Doan's. It's the kind of place you have a \"usual\" and every time you have it, it's just as good as the last time. They staff is friendly and speedy so if you don't have a long lunch it's a great place to go."}
{"input": "Best BBQ in Nashville!  Food is consistently amazing & all of their locations always a really fun, relaxed atmosphere. I recommend Edley's to all of my family and friends who come to visit."}
{"input": "Fantastic appetizers, average service, average main course.  As a couple we had calamari and steak carpaccio for appetizer.  Some of the best cooked calamari I've ever had.  Had langoustine with pasta and gnocchi.  Pasta didn't seem hand made.  Gnocchi was but was heavy.  Large portions.  Decor ok.  Looked like the back office was in the restaurant which was a little off-putting.  Will likely go back just, if just for the calamari!"}
{"input": "Stopped in here for a business lunch while traveling and was surprised to see how packed it was.  This must be a pretty solid lunch location for those that work downtown.  I ended up choosing the fajita salad and it was fine.  Nice cold bed of lettuce and a big heaping of meat on top.  Also on the side were salsa and sour cream.\n\nWe had a large group of 8 and the service staff did a great job of getting us seated, fed and on our way.\n\nNot sure about parking but I imagine it's a tough location for street parking and you'll need to find a deck or similar."}
{"input": "The service was good and the staff was polite, but the food was bland and lacked flavor. The drinks were ok about what you would expect of a chain restaurant. If you are looking for somewhere to sit Down for a quick lunch this might be your place."}
{"input": "I live down the street from the M.L. Rose's 8th Ave. location, so I haven't had a need to drive over to this location. But I'm glad I did! The vibe -- especially the outdoor seating areas -- are great and fit the surrounding area.\n\nI ordered the Five Alarm burger, my M.L. Rose go to. I ordered the burger medium well, and it was served medium well -- a feat that seems to becoming less common. The spicy jalapeños and habanero jack cheese provided the classic kick that makes this burger so great in my books. The accompanying sweet potato waffle fries were delicious as always.\n\nI'll still default to the 8th Ave. location, but this is a fine substitute if I'm ever in west Nashville."}
{"input": "Of all the restaurants we tried in New Orleans, this was by far our favorite. I had both lunch and dinner on two separate occasions. The service was wonderful, the ambiance is cozy but alive. Make sure to call ahead and get a reservation over the phone if opentable looks booked. Their lunch special spicy fried chicken is a must have! If you are a party of two or three, ask for the corner booth by the window. Best table in the house."}
{"input": "So, I am a repeat offender - and thankfully so.  I decided to share part of my anniversary celebration at EATalia.  Once again, I loved it and so did my spouse!  The service was exceptional, personable and professional.  And the specials were out of this world.  The cost is so fair it's a crime!  I can see this BYOB going pretty far and hope it does.  Frank, you demonstrated why this place is so special.  Thank you!!  And hats off to the Chef and Staff!"}
{"input": "Yes! So good. Whiskey cocktails are infinitely complex and well made. Also, I have a thing for Greek mythology so I dug the muse and persephone's downfall as two very creative cocktails.\n\nWe had an uncomfortable table right by the door and there is no table service but it did not matter; because the music was at just the right volume and tempo, the drinks were mind blowing, and all the food we ordered made us feel deeply happy.\n\nButternut squash ravioli. That is all."}
{"input": "I will get straight to the point..... If you are ever anywhere near Camden NJ, In fact if you are anywhere in the State of NJ, get to Santana's for breakfast and pastries.   Their coffee puts Starbucks, DD, Micky D's and all the rest to shame!!   Their pastries are INCREDIBLE!!  You would have to fly to Boricua ( Puerto Rico) to even come close!!    My business is in neighboring Pennsauken, and we are there every morning!!!"}
{"input": "This is the best deal of any Japanese food joint \".\"  You can order anything you want on the menu all for 10.99 (lunch). Place is packed and service is a bit slow , and our server wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed. If your in a hurry for lunch , I wouldn't recommend this place. However the food is fresh and delicious. This is my new sushi spot !"}
{"input": "Four of us just had hibachi dinners at Megu in Cherry Hill.  Unbelievably disappointing.  For some reason the waitress just ignored the four of us.  She took orders from multiple people around us, who had come in after we sat down and started delivering food to their tables before she ever came to our section of the hibachi table or acknowledged us.  I had to get the manager to get served. \nThe hibachi chef was one of the least skilled that I have ever seen.  One in our party ordered filet mignon.  He cooked all the dinners at our table, then after he served everyone realized that he hadn't cooked the filet, cooked it and gave it to the wrong person.  My friend didn't realize the mistake.  However, my wife pointed it out to me after we left.  Let me also mention that the place looks very worn and unkempt.  needless to say we will not be back.  Do yourself a favor and eat at any number of other Japanese restaurants that know what quality and good service mean."}
{"input": "I have been to this location once before with no issues. Last time I got my soon a bubble tea. The pearls (tapicoa bubbles) seemed to make him sick. I hope this place does a better job at assuring the drinks/food is fresh."}
{"input": "4 weeks ago I answered an add looking for women to enter into a 6 week challenge. I saw it as an opportunity to get back on track and maybe spend some time on myself. I really am absolutely impressed with Becky and her Fox Fitness workouts. Although she makes you work, the workouts (interval &  buddy) are fun and over before you notice it. I look forward to going each week, am getting ME back and am noticing changes already. Her help with nutrition is a bonus! I encourage anyone of any level who is looking for something new, meet new people, improve your strength and improve your nutrition to come check out Fox Fitness!"}

{"input": "Our youth non-profit hosted an 800-person convention at the Grand Hyatt Tampa Bay over July 4th weekend.  From the sales to convention staff, we were treated with respect and dealt a fair hand in terms of pricing.  Everyone from the front desk staff, to banquet staff, and so forth, were welcoming and accommodating to our group's needs.  With hundreds of kids running around, requests can get overwhelming but the staff handled them with grace.  Food that was catered from the Hyatt was tasty and never ran out.  \n\nWe had an excellent experience with Hyatt Hotels in 2010, followed that up with a similarly outstanding experience in 2012, and for our 2014 convention, will look to Hyatt no matter where we decide to host.  Thank you to the Grand Hyatt staff for a wonderful stay."}
{"input": "The pizza is very good so I can't give this place less than 4 stars. The menu is simple. But the price point and the fact that it's cash only is kind of a turnoff when I'm in the mood for a basic pizza, especially with the number of pizza places within a short walking distance from Grace & Pat's front door. \n\nAnd what is with the NYC subway signs? When you say \"Grandma pizza\" I think \"Grandma's house\" which means an absurd amount of dusty trinkets, tons of pictures, and maybe a plastic-covered sofa. Both of my Grandmas are from NYC and never decorated their homes with subway signs. I'm just saying."}
{"input": "Love this place - food is great and the price can't be beat!"}
{"input": "This is a cute lunch spot (that also serves breakfasts and teas/coffees/smoothies) where the focus is on fresh ingredients. The tortilla soup that I ordered was piping hot which is HUGE, as it seems like there is an epidemic going around of lukewarm/underheated food. While I waited for it to cool, I sampled the garden salad that my dining companion ordered. For a side salad, the portion was generous. The balsamic vinaigrette was tasty and an elevated alternative to the usual oil and vinegar dressing. The coffee drinks looked inventive as well. For add ons, I recommend the Billy Goat Chips. One also can't go wrong with one of the chocolate-chip cookies (all of the baked goods and desserts are made in house)."}
{"input": "Tasty selection and very preppy! \n\nOne cannot go wrong with the What's Up Doc omelet. One complaint with the omelets is the actual size, they seem to fluctuate. Clearly a difference in 4-5 extra bits worth of omelet. \n\nIf you have a sweet tooth, any of french toasts are great! Fancy Breakfast Sandwich is great! I substituted the prosciutto with bacon and got great results! Great mimosas!"}
{"input": "If you want to have some shake late in night go for it. I wont recommend it for other food menu if there are other options around place. We ordered meal deal but the server didn't get it complete thinking of saving money by not getting soda ....two of my friends got cold burger and fries and instead of making fresh new ones, they just warmed it up in the small oven....ah this is what you get from such places. Luckily my burger and fries were hot so i  wasn't as mad as them ....veggie options are OK.\nagain go only if there is no other option ..there are many other places around.."}
{"input": "The donair meat was very cheap tasting....like it came out of a can or something gross.   The place looks run down.  We won't be back.  People who think this is the best donair have lived a very sheltered life in the land of donairs!  This is probably one of my worst ones!"}
{"input": "The chicken chow mein is what the kids love. The sesame chicken is light, crispy and good for the whole family. We took 3 kids had sesame chicken, beef with broccoli, chicken chow mein and steamed rice. We left with 2 to go boxes so the portions are good sized. The whole meal with tea and soft drinks was under $40. It was a very early dinner so it was not at all crowded. We will definitely be back."}
{"input": "I would give this place 0 stars if I could. We went during Sunday happy hour and I specifically asked our waitress about specials and she told me brunch was over and there were no other specials. Come to find out there was a whole happy hour menu and 2 of the beers we ordered were on happy hour but we were charged full price. The waitress was not apologetic, just annoyed when I confronted her and said \"I didn't know you wanted happy hour\". I was confused because it is the first thing I asked her whenever she finally decided to greet our table.  She also rarely came to our table to check on us. Go elsewhere, there are plenty of better places in the area to eat and drink."}
{"input": "This place was perfect for kids of all ages. There are so many great things to see and everything was very modern and up to date. I was impressed with all of the exhibits and information available. There were so many things for the kids to play with. Lots of family restrooms, which made it easy for our large family and free parking was definitely a plus.\n\nThe only con was the cafeteria. It is not set up to be very user friendly at all. I think it's needs to have a better lay out with better information to explain where to get all the different kinds of food or just make one area to get the food instead of having to wait in 5 different lines."}
{"input": "This place was awesome! Scenery is beautiful, outside dining is nice, and food was great!"}
{"input": "I have been several times now and they always miss large spots on my bikini and my upper legs. I had bought a prepaid package and when this is done I will find elsewhere to go..I shouldn't have to shave after getting waxed.."}
{"input": "I cannot say enough how much I loved this place!! It has a great old school diner vibe. The workers there were so so nice. I had never had gumbo and they make it to order but they made us 2 little tasters, and I usually don't even like shrimp but I ate every last bite!!! We also had the grits, fried chicken and the split pea soup was the best freaking split pea soup I have ever had in my life and I am not kidding. And the prices are insanely affordable, between the 2 of us we ordered a lot of food and beers for only $25. Great deal!"}
{"input": "Glad to have a location closer to home,  The bbq is consistently good, especially the pork and turkey.  A good option for take-home dinners when you're tired of the same old fast food."}
{"input": "So these wings are perfect for when you get off work and don't feel like cooking. They are always fresh, hot and taste so good. I'm not a fan of the fried rice so that's the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars. They are similar to manchu chicken wings, good!!"}
{"input": "Food was great. Staff was nice, friendly and helpful with menu suggestions. The Happy Hour is a good deal and the house margaritas tasted better than many other restaurants I've visited. I had the chicken poblano which was great. My friend enjoyed his enchiladas and they allowed him to have 3 different types on one plate."}
{"input": "This is the best ewing has to offer. Food is good and prices are reasonable. They need a larger appetizer selection.  Sals is our go to place when we are not sure where to go. Service is good but it is obvious that some of the girls smoke during their shift. That's a bit nasty. Over all a really good restaurant."}
{"input": "I took my family and my daughter today for the very first time. There was a lot of things to do for my daughter and she loved it! I would've given this place 5 stars but I'm only giving it 2 stars because this place is filthy. For the price that we paid for each admission including my 15 month old daughter, management should do a way better job maintaining the cleanliness of this place!!! I did not see any staff wipe down anything the whole entire, there were electrical cords hanging around where kids can touch, and there were dust everywhere!!!! I was pretty disappointed!!! I really hope management will look into this and improve it. I never write any reviews but I feel this was definitely something I need to share."}
{"input": "I can't say enough to good about this place!  Was very surprised to find such a gem that close to Bourbon St. This a craft cocktail bat and these guys know what the are doing. They had a fun 3 piece jazz band playing that gave a great vibe.  The real treat/test was a great Vieux Carre that's was spot on!!!  The gin Bee's Knees was great. If you don't mind paying a little more for a great drink this is the place in New Orleans!"}
{"input": "This is literally the best hotel in the French quarter. It has a fantastic location and there are many restaurants close by the hotel within walking distance. The hotel has the right balance of privacy and services. However there are not cabs readily available.  But if you walk up the street a bit there is a cab stand. The breakfast at the hotel is excellent. I will definitely be back!"}
{"input": "Mailed a poster-specifically asked the guy to tape the c ends of the poster tubes- he said he would -well the package arrived to the recipient empty-went to file claim-the owner seemed disinterested  in helping me-in fact it seemed he had no clue about anything -no urgency  in providing any customer service- it's been a month and I've been back and forth trying to get a resolution -not a one of the people seem to know anything , follows up on the situation -I've  done everything  I've  been asked to do and provide-terrible service-im about to lose my shit - it's maddening -DO YOUR JOB-IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE"}
{"input": "Had a really good sandwich here once, and a damn good burger here another time. I've always been impressed with their tap list, and can always find something new to drink here. Bartenders and servers seem really nice.\n\nIt's dimly lit but doesn't feel like a dive... it's too hip for that. I haven't spent enough time here to give it a real honest assessment, but I like what I've seen so far."}
{"input": "The service was very good and our food came out pretty quickly. The food was just so-so though. My grain salad (Farro?) has crunchy bits like it was undercooked or left out to harden. My husband has the chicken and said it was dry. Honestly not a terrible meal, but at $17 a plate it was not worth the price."}
{"input": "Barry's is awesome!  Instructors are really nice and energetic, Antonio's the best!  I really like the Wednesday Chest & Back class.  Very clean, showers, and great products.  Do not need a lock for the lockers, super easy.  Playlist is great too."}
{"input": "This burger tastes like the one my dad made on the grill growing up. I went back a cpl more times. So good! Ppl were on top of it and the store was clean and fun. I'm sure another visit will be made. Thanks  five guys"}
{"input": "Holiday Inn Express is a good place to stay for a night while on a business trip.  Did I miss having room service, yes.  Overall, I would recommend this location."}
{"input": "All the crepes I've tried are fantastic. The coffee is very good, though I wish they had larger sizes available. Looks tiny from the outside there is comfortable seating in the basement."}
{"input": "I was impressed with this pizza place's selection.  I stopped in for a quick bite and ordered a roast beef sandwich (that was very delicious.)  The sandwich did take about 15 to 20 minutes to get out of the kitchen.  Seating is non-existent in the restaurant, but there is a community patio next to Castrillo's.  I am excited to try their pizza.  I've only heard good things."}
{"input": "We called Sierra Air on February 24th Saturday for them to check our thermostat to furnace was not working.  Sierra Air came within the hour and cleaned the furnace sensors and all was well.  We bought our home a couple years ago and this was the first time we had the furnace serviced, now we know to have it serviced annually, especially for all the Safety Sensors.  The Serviceman was very polite and answered all our questions.  Thank You Sierra Air!"}
{"input": "Ordered for pick up and was told 45 minutes. Arrived 45 minutes after ordering and waited another 45 minutes for cold food. Never again. I'll never pay 40$ for an hour and a half wait for cold food. I'll go to the place on the next corner and get my food faster and hotter."}
{"input": "We live close by so decided to go here. Not up to expectations. The tv's were blasting loud and the place was not that clean especially considering how few people were in there. The food was very average. There are a lot of other better options out there."}
{"input": "I decided to give this place a try though my go to\npizza place is Angelos on Larchmont. Well, the delivery was prompt and everything was hot thus the two stars. I ordered the chicken cutlet sandwich on a seeded roll but asked for sautéed spinach instead of broccoli rabe, which they gave me. Unfortunately, the sautéed spinach had no taste and I didn't taste any sharp provolone cheese either (you would have surely tasted it). I had to add garlic powder, red pepper flakes and grated parm cheese so it had some taste. The seeded roll was the winner. As a result of the good reviews of the rice balls I decided to order them. Gross - right in the trash. To all of the New Yorkers who ate here and said it was as good as New York Italian food doesn't know good food from mediocre food. Back to Angelos. Best food around!"}
{"input": "This is my favorite restaurant in the world. Hands down.  Here's why:\n\n1- Old and nothing has changed\n2- The cheeseburger. It's a fish place, I know -  trust me, get the cheeseburger\n3- The smoked fish spread appetizer\n4- Root beer /draft beer in ice-cold mugs\n5- Touring the fish house\n6- Oh, and the german potato salad\n\nFor real, this place will change your life."}
{"input": "I had a dinner meeting here on Tuesday night. The Cajun Ribeye steak was cooked to perfection. We were having a great dinner get together, until the waiter accidently knock over a glass of red wine and it wound up on an associate of mine. Really do not think a free desert was the best choice of action in this case"}
{"input": "Hands down best breakfast in Philly!  I've only been here for four months, but I have tried nearly every \"Best of\" spot in town.  I'm a breakfast fanatic so I get little over critical.  However, this small cafe has managed to create incredible flavor while keeping their dishes fresh and simplistic.  While the actual space is \"cozy,\" this menu could easily keep a place as big as Parc overflowing with patrons."}
{"input": "Sometimes a sticky floor is all you ever need to know about the quality of a restaurant. I really wanted to like this place because the burger was tasty and I like all the topping options. Though between taking 30 minutes to get a basket of cold onion rings and hot fries, long after the burgers had been delivered, and the sticky tables and duct-taped upholstery, I cannot recommend this place."}
{"input": "At Xochitl, I had both the best of food and the worst of drinks which is why I only gave it 3 stars. I had the best Spicy Brisket Taco. Ever. The Esquites is divine. However, the Shrimp Chile Nogada was just ok (wouldn't order again) and they make the WORST basic margaritas I have ever had. I realize margaritas aren't exactly old world Mexico and authentic to the culture pre mid 1930's or 40's, but if you are going to taut your margs, at least try. The atmosphere is quaint in the historic district and the servers helpful, though not very attentive."}
{"input": "Love this place! Great service, great techs. Can master any design and always have the latest trends for nails. Make sure you schedule your next appt during your current appointment because they are always busy, which is great because they are so well respected! Always attentive and appreciative of their customers."}
{"input": "I've been here quite a few times now and the ambiance and food are great! It is a bit on the pricey side but their salads are worth it! They have a make your own salad list, where you can check any ingredients you want in your salad for a flat price of $15 and the portions are huge! \n\nThe service here is also great! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"input": "This place used to be nice but over the years it has degraded a little. \n\nI actually like sitting in the bar when not to many people are in there smoking. I think you get much better service and heck half price apitizers are pretty awesome.\n\nThe last time we went I was not feeling great as it was and eating endless chips, waiting for drink refils and waiting almost 45 minutes for food was pretty bad. I wouldn't say that the service sucked but it could have been way better.\n\nI took most of my meal home and it never reheats very well in the micro-wave at work. \n\nOver all I think this place is ok but I am loosing interest in it and need a new mexican go to spot. Heck this is more fake mexican anyway.\n\nHope if I go again that we get our food faster."}
{"input": "If you like onion rings order them here. Some of the best I have ever have. I also had a Reuben which was very good also."}
{"input": "I hate places that brag about their local heirloom ingredients and then serve the same crap everyone else does. Since when did grape tomatoes become heirlooms? Local vegetables in January? Hardly likely. Be honest and admit you are a bar with average food with above average prices. Service was snotty and you really felt like they were doing you a favor by coming to your table. Serve cream or at least something white with the coffee, maybe the heirloom heritage cow was off for the day?"}
{"input": "I Recently vacationed in St. Petersburg with my family. Dooners was definitely my favorite meal of the trip. Great food and incredibly helpful and friendly staff. Would definitely recommend to anyone, and wouldn't hesitate to go again."}
{"input": "Ice cream wasn't the best, and definitely not for the price. But it was there when I was passing through Belmawr, and it hit the spot when I needed to satisfy my sweet tooth! \n\nThe service was friendly, albeit a little slow. And the place has a cute, quaint charm about it with the decor. If I lived in the area I'd probably return, but I wouldn't make any special trips to go back here."}
{"input": "Locally owned place on the heart of magazine street. The food is absolutely amazing. Definitely post partying/hangover/guilt free food! Give it a try after a night out in town."}
{"input": "Great frozen custard at a great price. The only potential drawback is if they don't have a flavor you want, but that shouldn't even be a consideration."}
{"input": "Finally went in after walking by so many times. Glad we did. Small place but IR is pleasing to the eye. One wall cover with wood palates and subtle two tone gray walls. Started with the prosciutto fig arugula Parmesan flatbread appetites. Enough for two people and delicious. Nice mix of flavors. Main dishes were a burger grass fed beef with fries coated with truffles dusting. Burger was humongous!  Looked good smelled good and tasted good. I had a seafood soup with fish ( not sure what it was) shrimp and mollusks in a  coconut/ curry broth. Deliciously spicy but not enough to kill your taste buds. Overall I would recommend this place. We went early as we heard it gets crowded and they do not take reservations.  BYW great wine and craft beer selections"}
{"input": "Awful experience, the $10 rolls I got were super little. Also, it took forever for our waitress to get to our table for anything. When we got the check, she gave us the same checks and then we asked to fix it charged the wrong card the wrong amount. Never came back for refills also there was barely anybody in the restaurant on a Saturday night."}
{"input": "This Dunkin' Donuts is on US-13 northbound. However, southbound access is available either via U-turn at the next intersection or via the adjacent Comcast parking lot, from which there's a connecting lane. This Dunkin' Donuts is open 24/7, which is convenient for late-night or late-shift folks. I didn't check the restroom but otherwise, I could see no issue with this establishment. The indoor seating area was clean and service was straightforward and efficient."}
{"input": "In reality this is some of the best food I have ever had.  I have had Mylassian before, and we frequent Penang which is also Great, but this place is way better. Just off of 5th and South. South Street is also making a comeback with many great eclectic restaurants and Shops. I have to give this place to thumbs up.  The best kept secret in Philly."}
{"input": "We have been using Robert since he walked around our neighborhood starting his business about 7 or 8 years ago.  He is always responsive, does a great job and makes my yard something I don't worry about.  He does the spring turn on, sends guys to fix broken sprinklers, does PHENOMENAL clean up when I ask, shuts down and winterizes the yard and truly, truly loves what he does. If you let him do his job you will be thrilled.  I don't ever worry about my dogs being let out and he is familiar with both of them!!!\n\nHe is honest, hard working and his crew is great.  If you are in need of a great service Keeping it Green and Robert are your company.  He also sells Christmas trees and we just love him.  There is no one better!!!!"}
{"input": "Been here twice...once just for drinks and once for lunch. Both times were great. Nice and strong drinks reasonably priced. For lunch, had the tri-tip sandwich. Was excellent choice as tri-tip was so thinly sliced it was more like roast beef and even came with au-jus, which was one of the best seasoned I have ever had...it wasn't just beef broth. Wasn't able to choose between salad and fries for the side and waitress said they could split and do both, which was a plus.\n\nAway from the hustle and bustle of State St. and easier to find parking. Great patio for lunch and great bar inside where the locals hang out."}
{"input": "Only the best Mexican food in Florida!!!!  Since the first day I tried it I love it I keep coming back!!!"}
{"input": "The food was really delicious. I had the Banana Foster pancakes, and Southern Pecan coffee. Both were fantastic.  The pictures don't do them justice.\n\nYou might be able to sit at the bar with a shorter wait. We sat down immediately at the bar, after arriving shortly after they opened for the morning.  Sandra's about a 35 minute wait for a table. It's a little bit of a tight area around the bar, not much space, but it worked out well for us.  \n\nService was friendly and relatively prompt. However, I might imagine if things got busy it would slow down quite a bit.  Perhaps not the most organized restaurant."}
{"input": "Excellent food and service every time! Cornbread and corn pudding are awesome. The sauces are just right! Love this place!"}
{"input": "Love this neighborhood bakery/pizza joint.  The mushroom pizza is awesome. Once they warm it, it is perfect!  \n\nI have not tried all their delicious sweets.  However, their classic birthday cake is so good! It's not too sweet and has jam in the layer which gives it such a nice taste!\n\nThe only compliant I have, I wish there was a sitting area.  I live not too far so it works.... The pizza stays warm :-)"}
{"input": "A po-boy is simple. French bread, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, the stuffings and hot sauce. \n\nDon't expect anything more extravagant than that!\n\nEven though you may be turned off from the combination of ingredients, you have to try it all together. It fits like puzzle pieces!\n\nThe crawfish po-boy here was beautiful. I loved it! It was simple, balanced and best of all, brimming with lightly fried crawfish.\n\nI also recommend the alligator steak pieces. Actually, I'm not really sure what they were called, but it's Alligator something and it was AMAZING. I will probably pine away before I can get my hands on those succulent bites again, since it's not often you find them in MD or VA.\n\nAnyways, I digress.\n\nGood stuff."}
{"input": "We have had a blast to each event we've been to.  We've been to concerts and basketball games and other were a lot of fun.  The food is really good, also.  A lot of local favorites are offered."}
{"input": "Good food but they need to work on their organization. It's busy, we know but the whole mobile order thing, people waiting and ordering food, refills, other customers that just need general assistance etc. It gets chaotic. For instance mobile ordering, I come and pick up my food. Once I click that \"I'm here\" button, my name should be called and my food should handed to me. However if no one ever acknowledges I'm there or if I can't get someone's attention because they just walk right past you, I'm left standing there unsatisfied."}
{"input": "De vacaciones y sin ganas de cocinar, decidimos (x8) pedir pizzas en este lugar para retirar y comer en el lugar en el que nos estábamos hospedando, que quedaba a 500 metros. Así que, un jueves de verano, las fuimos a buscar cerca de las 21.30 horas.\nEntramos y nos pareció muy ameno, limpio y confortable para comer ahí. Nos atendió un hombre muy amable y atento.\nPedimos los siguientes sabores:\n- prosciutto (jamón crudo);\n- ham (jamón cocido);\n- pepperoni;\n- cebolla;\n- hongos;\n- anchoas y\n- albahaca y tomate.\n\nLas pizzas tardaron 25/30 minutos. Todos sus gustos -de los cuales subo foto- estuvieron deliciosos. El estilo de pizza fue a la piedra, con salsa de tomate y queso muzzarela en una cantidad ideal.\nSi bien este comentario parece limitarse únicamente a una estricta relación precio-calidad, no menos verdad es que, en mi opinión, la calidez con la que fuimos recibidos reflejó cómo hubiera sido el trato de haber decidido cenar ahí mismo.\nNo dudo en valorar a este lugar con cinco estrellas."}
{"input": "Ok yeah, the service can be a little high falutin', and the wait is painful but this is THE BEST BURGER EVER.  That's all you need to know.  The BEST."}
{"input": "Amazing. Cheap. Fills me up. Did I mention it's one of the best Mexican restaurants I've had the pleasure to enjoy. Hot and hotter sauces are perfect. Tacos are great. Meats are cooked with he prefect seasoning.  Tender and juicy. Chips are tortilla shells fried. Salsa and guacamole are lovely. I will review again next time with pictures!"}
{"input": "Went the other night for take out got an order of 12 wings and a buffalo chicken cheese steak both were very good no complaints at all.  Wings were tender and tasty and sandwich was spot on better then average quality chicken.  Also, picked up a soup to go last second for only $1.50 chicken escarole was a nice surprise and great price.  Need to check out the dinners and try it a few times to see if they can be consistent with food, but for now was very pleased.  Owner may want to pull back on all the Dallas Cowboys schwag all over the place may not sit well with customers that are Eagles fans and I have no doubt this would turn them off, but maybe he is going for a laugh who knows just would not chance it.  Good spot."}
{"input": "Wow! I never thought my sons phone could be repaired after he dropped it but it is and it took less than a half an hour! Very professional and excellent service! I'm thrilled!"}
{"input": "stayed here two nights.\n\nThe hotels best attribute is the location. Close to historic sites, bars, restaurants.\n\nOther than that, its a mediocre hotel at best. Not much decor, rooms are standard  size. The bed isnt too comfortable.\nSmall bathroom.\n\nWe did hit up the pool which is on the 4th floor. Its a 4 foot pool decent enough to hang out and take a dip.\n\nEssentially you will be paying for the location. Parking is 36 bucks a day so be warned! \nOverall the stay was good. The front desk is helpful but the hotel rooms were definitely forgetable."}
{"input": "Good food, traditional, nice little bar, large portions, and friendly service. Give them a look."}
{"input": "Best popcorn I have ever had. I go up to New Hope a few times a month. I found this gem back in July and have never been disappointed. You won't be either. Staff and owners are pretty awesome too."}
{"input": "I don't care what other people say, I really had a good experience at the Texas Roadhouse.  FYI:  The cheeseburgers are very good!"}
{"input": "Atmosphere is casual. Indoor and outdoor seating. Service was good. I had garlic parmesan wings. They were good but a little greasy."}
{"input": "30th Street Station is a great train station. \n\nIt is a beautiful building, but not quite as nice as Union Station in DC. It is smaller than Penn Station and Grand Central in New York City. So, it is easier to navigate but still gets you where you need to go.\n\nFood options are a bit limited. My go-to restaurant in 30th Street is Cosi.\n\nAll of the bus companies (megabus, bolt bus, etc.) stop right outside of 30th Street Stayion. This is much better than in NYC where the bus stops are random places in the city.\n\nSEPTA runs right by 30th Street Station, so you can easily get from the station to other parts of Philly."}
{"input": "This place is a lot of fun. I like that there is a outdoor patio with hip hop music and indoor dance area with salsa . If you need a change in tunes or scenery , just move !"}
{"input": "Can't believe I haven't tried Chipotle until today!  Me and my girlfriend decided to go for dinner this evening, and from what she told me I was pretty excited.  As you walk in and approach the counter you can see the different protein choices, salsas, rice, etc.  I decided to go with a burrito with white lime-cilantro rice, black beans, steak, pico de gallo, and cheese.  The burrito was massive, and was less than 7 dollars!  Ingredients all tasted fresh, very refreshing.  I honestly can't wait to go again!  My only complaint is that the chips we shared were stale, and horribly over salted.  4 stars."}
{"input": "The location is great for those staying and touring the French Quarter.  Use the valet...parking in the Quarter is a headache."}
{"input": "I eat at Pina's or take-out about once a month. My favorites includes their dinner specials, cheesesteaks, calzones, and seafood dishes. The shrimp scampi appetizer (sans linguini) and steamed clams are excellent  inexpensive. Service is always flawless. For casual dining this place is very good."}
{"input": "This restaurant is absolutely stunning. My fav dish is the lobster mac. I've heard many people say that they do not like the food but I really enjoy it. The atmosphere is awesome. Beautiful views of the city. There is a seperate lounge area that is fun. Service has always been great. I've also attended a private dining event which was beautiful! My 2nd fav restaurant in the city."}
{"input": "Popped in to get gas in the work vehicle today and that was the most confusing fleet card experience I have ever had in my life.  I'm still confused as to why it was so confusing.\n\nAnyhoo, this location has a car wash, fuel, as well as a fairly big snack/drink section for a Hughes.\n\nI'm sure I'll be seeing you again Hughes :-)"}
{"input": "This place was magnificent!!! Great food, if you order the cheese you get ur waitress to flame it right infront of you with a big \"Opa!\". The muscles were great taste and very fresh, the lamb was amazing great variety of cuts and very well cooked!!! I would recommend this place with my eyes close!.  The only reason why I don't give them a 5 star is because they had no parking or coat rooms."}
{"input": "Thank goodness someone said don't worry about the number of reviews! I just walked in today and got a hour massage (half hour chair, half hour feet) for $60. Highly recommend David!"}
{"input": "I walked in saddened by the fact this city has no speakeasies.... right to the bar and said \"I don't like scotch but make me anything!\" And let me tell you the bartenders are true mixologists. They have kept me impressed the whole night. The jazz music playing also adds to the ambiance. I can't wait to come back and bring the significant other to this place"}
{"input": "Over priced medicore bar food. \n\nThey have a new menu. The menu on their website contained some better options. The new slimmed down menu has fewer and much less appealling offerings. It is now just over priceded bar food. Nothing special here. Burgers, wings, salads and mediocre sushi. Blah."}
{"input": "Really like this place..Food isn't always the star of the show, but doesnt mean its not good..It really is. Good selection of beer, wine list is simple and good. But sets a great vibe that you can tell makes it everyones neighborhood joint. Always a fun time."}
{"input": "I've lived in the Philadelphia area for about 15 years and I'm sad to say that I only learned of Ralphs about a year ago. \n\nTo me, Ralphs is the embodiment of Philadelphia. The food is about as traditional Italian as you can get. It's the oldest Italian Restuarant in America that is still operating. The food is great and the service is exactly what you would expect from an old school Italian joint. \n\nIf you are hosting guests from out of town and you want to show them what Philadelphia is all about...take them to Ralphs. They will leave very full and completely satisfied. \n\nTruly one of Philadelphia's most prized venues."}
{"input": "I am a huge fan of P.F. Chang's, so when I found out that they made a fast food-type restaurant, I was excited.\n\nThe atmosphere isn't like P.F. Chang's; it's loud and it does have a more fast food feel to it. I did, however, love the way it was set up; you order your food at the bar, sit down, and they bring it out to you in 5 minutes (if that).\n\nThe food itself was absolutely fantastic compared to about of time it took to make and the price. I was very pleased and surprised with all of the flavors it had. I would recommend going there."}
{"input": "The food here is so great and fresh. I don't shy away from my kids favorite Wonton Soup because i know they take the time to cook it."}
{"input": "As airport grab-and-go restaurants are, Earl does a decent job with a variety of sandwich options including turkey, tuna and even a Hawaiian. But today I could smell the roast beef and so I got that one. Yum. Good portion of sliced beef that was beyond medium cooked with cheddar cheese and a yummy horseradish sauce. Nope, don't get lettuce or tomatoes on it. It's perfect the way it is.\n\nAnd since it's right between the security station and the top of the D gates (right near the Delta SkyClub!), it's easy to get and eat at the gate or on board."}
{"input": "The Terrace Lounge is appropriately opulent for a casino bar.  My friend and I had a couple of tasty libations while we listened to live music.  I had the Peartini, and it was a unique blend of vodka and pear.  The service is excellent and friendly.  This is a nice place to hang out away from the bustle of the casino."}
{"input": "Ate at this restaurant while attending the Sugar Bowl and had a good time. The place definitely is a \"hole in the wall\". It's located on a busy intersection and the exterior looks run down. We arrived around 6pm and there was already a line. We had to wait about 30 mins before we got a table. The interior was no different from the outside. It was small, it had cheap tables and chairs, and was cramped. \n\nAs with most other reviewers, the food and service more than made up for the rundown decor. Our waitress was nice and professional and food was quick to arrive. We got a dozen oysters, blackened alligator, and seafood basket. Oysters were fresh, the alligator was tasty, and the seafood were cooked perfectly. \n\nOverall, this was a nice restaurant outside of downtown NOLA. If you can get over the \"hole in the wall\" atmosphere, then this is a place to visit."}
{"input": "Absolutely love coming to Tires Plus in Lutz . I've been coming back for years because of the wonderful service we always get . John Nietubicz has excellent customer service and he has been the one I've dealt with many times in the past . Today we were helped by a gentleman named Brad ,who I found out recently transferred from the New Port Richey store . He was  on top of every step that was being done to my daughter's car . It's always such a pleasure coming to this location - loyal customer here ! Thanks guys ! Highly recommended. Five stars is not enough to rate this store !"}
{"input": "My wife bought a car here.  I handled the negotiations.  \n\nOur salesman was friendly and helpful.  Once the negotiations began however, our salesman left the picture and we were left to deal with the manager.  This experience was annoying.  I had done my research and shopped around.  The manager must not be accustomed to dealing with informed shoppers because he was obviously lying to me on a number of fronts.  Had my wife not needed the car immediately - and wanted a color that was only available this dealer - I would have moved on to another dealership.  \n\nMy advice would be that if you have to come here be armed with knowledge and info on pricing from other dealers but in general I would probably buy from a different dealer if I had to do it over."}
{"input": "I am new to homebrewing and am so thankful for this place! I've been in once and they answered all my questions. I've even called in when I was having trouble getting my keg tapped and they very pleasantly helped me figure out was was wrong! I love Philly Homebrew Outlet and will be purchasing from them in the future!"}
{"input": "Despite being a staunch meat-eater, I can say without question this place rocks! My brother and a friend (both vegans) also enjoy this place. So, it's safe to say that this is a great spot to get food in general -- whether you're a vegan or otherwise!"}
{"input": "If you are looking for the classic small cramp sushi place, then this is the place for you. The service is lack luster, but the food makes up for the poor table management and not so smart waiters."}
{"input": "Johnny Tucci and his crew are the absolute best videographers, hands down. They are professional, prompt, and extremely talented. They made our wedding footage look like a movie production and brought everyone to tears that watched it. My advice is that if you are going to splurge in one area for your special day, spend it on a videographer. They do not disappoint."}
{"input": "Symphony nails is just amazing! I haven't even finished my manicure or pedicure and I am already writing this review. They are very kind and if your like me and enjoy a good massage, COME HERE!! Whenever I am in town again for work I will be visiting them."}
{"input": "Terrific hotel! I booked on a whim because there was a deal going on, and it was worth every dollar. Fantastic room and great service. No complaints. Breakfast is not included, which is pretty standard for such a hotel, but there is a cafe and restaurant on site for convenience. I would definitely stay here again if I happen to come across another deal."}
{"input": "Went here with a couple co-workers for lunch and they were really good. The place is a bit small inside, so you feel a little cramped inside. However, the service is quick. They were busy when we arrived around 12:30 (so right at lunch) and they still kept everything moving in a very quick pace. Plus the amount of food you get is pretty decent, and they are pretty inexpensive. Will be back for sure."}
{"input": "I went to the pearl for my birthday and every detail of the experience was awesome!  The food, the wine and the service were all impeccable!  We didn't realize the time and were chatting away after closing time and the staff never made us feel rushed."}
{"input": "Worth a try.\n\nTwo of us went there for dinner after 3 hours of driving.  It is across the street from the Westin. \n\nMcLeod is well appointed and inviting.  The staff were friendly, albeit a touch slow.  Not a deal breaker, but still....\n\nWe shared beef sliders as an appetizer.  They were fresh and delicious, and well presented.   We ordered the linguine as a main.  Now, most pub pasta is an adventure, at best.   This was perfectly cooked with a nice taste.  Well done Chef.   \n\nAdd to this both the World Series game and hockey game on big screens, and some adult beverages and it was a good evening.  \n\nI will go back...maybe tomorrow."}
{"input": "Aw, man. I was hoping I'd previously posted a glowing review of RuSan's so I could prove that once upon a time, I liked it here. But, I didn't so just trust me on this one.\n\nIt is with a heavy heart that I relay today's experience over the lunch sushi buffet. Cold, gelatinous, and ~$11/each. It's been a year or three but I remember this being so much better. Don't get me wrong... I love cheap, fast food-ish, ethnic cuisine and I have lovely memories of the Ginger Simmered Beef, Fried Garlic and Bay Shrimp Salad Maki (like I said, once upon a time), but today? Lackluster is an overstatement.\n\nWith each bite, I kept hoping the next would be better. But, alas. It wasn't. \n\nWhy, RuSan's? With all your new neighboring restauranteurs in The Gulch, is this the taste of complacency? I shake my head in disappointment because I know your potential and cherish what we once had. \n\nOn the upside, my water was refreshing and the service was fine."}
{"input": "I guess it is an old habit from when I was still active duty and had the need for a haircut every week, but one of the first things I like to do in a new town is find a good barbershop. So, I went with the reviews on Yelp and tried The Men's Room. This is it, great haircut, cool dudes, clean, a free drink and massage, The Men's Room has made it to the top of the list! There is more than one reason so many people have given them 5 stars."}
{"input": "I went to Sparkle Car Wash last night at 5:52 pm.  As soon as I entered the parking lot I noticed the sign that read they were open until 6pm.  They, however, were not open.  I was very disappointed.  Closing early is poor customer service!  It's no wonder they haven't gotten too many positive reviews."}
{"input": "Blue Sage, an old favorite, is even better in its new location (1/2 block south of original site). It has three times the space, half the noise level, and is a hundred times more attractive. Best of all, the food remains creative and amazing."}
{"input": "both locations deserve 5 stars but my favorite location is in rittenhouse . I love the atmosphere :) \n\nGetting a tria card is well worth the small fee its a great way to keep track of the different wines, beers and cheese.  Sign up for the email lists as well they will keep you in the know of all the happenings going on during the week. \n\nTria has great staff , fantastic cheeses, wines and beers from all over the world."}
{"input": "Waxing services by Wendy are amazing!  As always, a wonderful experience!  The atmosphere is calming and relaxing. I can't say enough about Alston Face and Body!"}
{"input": "Best frozen custard I've ever had. I got the Muni mocha and tried the cookie dough concretes, both were delicious but maybe would have failed the inversion test. Great service and inexpensive."}
{"input": "The portions were so incredibly tiny and service was extremely slow. Would've given one star but they gave us a free appetizer for the long wait which was nice. My boyfriend ordered the lamb and I ordered the steak tartare. The food was pretty good but just don't come here with an empty stomach because the entrees will not fill you up."}
{"input": "been to nearly all the high-end steak houses in Philly, this might just be my favorite.  Right up there with Barclay Prime, though two totally different joints.  This is your classic old school place.  Waiter we had was amazing, and that never hurts your experience.  Everything we ate was great - apps, sides, meats, desserts.\n\n100% I recommend getting the prime rib.  We got a steak and a prime rib and split the two.  they didn't name the place 'the prime rib' for no reason, right?  Probably the best prime rib I've ever had, was way better than their filet, makes it a unique experience from the other steak joints in town."}
{"input": "FINALLY!   A Chipotle that I love.  You have restored my faith in you.  The meat is cooked, they give you enough of a serving and the staff is friendly.  I sat outside and ate and people watched."}
{"input": "Normally this Hardees is quite good and the manager is wonderful. He is always friendly and helpful and hard working.  he food is usually good and fast.These morons they had working yesterday were awful. They must be new or just have no business working in\"fast food\". They took like twenty minutes to help each customer then got the orders wrong,then didnt even apologize to anyone for their mistakes. You could tell they didnt care at all."}
{"input": "Unmotivated employees - During lunch time, they have 2-3 people operating the line. Other times, usually 1 works the line and 1 sits/stands in the rear.\n\nFalse advertising - At the bottom of the receipt, it asks you to take a survey for a free cookie. After completing the survey, I returned with my receipt only to be told that the manager does not allow free items. I can pay full price instead.\n\nCrowded seating - tables are just off the walkways. If you sit against the wall on the left as you enter, claustrophobia is inevitable as the line forms next to you. \n\nAverage food at best - they have no shame in pulling lettuce or turkey directly out of the bag under the counter. No attempt to place it in the bins on the counter.\n\nParking - that's another beast in itself. Potholes, faded lines."}
{"input": "This Chipotle location was great! I wanted to thank Chipotle for recognizing teachers for Teacher Appreciation Week! \nThe line was very small and they served quickly as a pose to another location that had the line wrapped around the store! \nTheir food is always fresh, tasteful and fulfilling! \nMy go to is always the bowl with white cilantro lime rice,black beans, steak and all the toppings! \nMust eat with a bag of fresh tortilla chips!!"}
{"input": "Good price and hive atmosphere. Beignets are way better than cafe du monde, though you still need to go there too so you can say you've been there. Great mocha and brown sugar praline cookie here too. Nice music in the courtyard. Check it out!"}
{"input": "I really like this boba tea place, especially their rose oolong tea. the bobas are soft (but not too soft) and chewy. I stop by every time I crave for boba tea. Also, their egg puff is good too! You can have it with or without ice cream."}
{"input": "This was an outstanding experience. Great customer service great food will come back again try Lane Snapper the whole fry"}
{"input": "A little over crowded, but the drinks were fine. I would recommend a different place, but this one is fine."}
{"input": "Absolutely delicious for lunch and dinner. Charming atmosphere and great service. Food is fresh and flavorful."}
{"input": "First time here and I got the turkey burger bc it was a special. I regret it. Not that it wasn't good but I'm not a big fan of turkey burgers. My own fault. However, the fries were yummy and fresh and like the name of the place is called you build your own burger. I will highly come back here to try their beef burger or salmon burger."}
{"input": "Stopped in here for a quick coffee while running errands one day (love me some Kaldi's!) and we have been back at least once a week since then. It is always super fresh, quick, and tasty! Today I had the crunchy kale salad. First of all...I was presented with a ginormous bowl of yummies! I generally get towards the end of a salad and pick out the good stuff. Problem was this was ALL good stuff. So I ate all of it. And I'm full. But not heavy feeling. Everyone is super nice and everything I've had is awesome."}
{"input": "Bad service, always out of things and rude when you ask them to refill it, pastries aren't great. Even when there are as many employees as there are customers, they simply ignore you and take personal calls!! Ridiculous!!"}
{"input": "The food wasn't anything special but I did like the intimate setting and the comedians were pretty funny. I wouldn't want to sit up front though, or else you may get made fun of lol. There's a 2 item minimum per person also"}
{"input": "The catfish, chicken, gumbo and mac &a cheese are all to die for. We are the lunch buffet and everything was piping hot and fresh. This place was recommended by a local in the neighborhood we are staying in and it was so worth it!"}
{"input": "Food was OK... Not WOW or horrible\nService though... Hmm... We were there during happy hour and it was our first time to the restaurant, so we thought we would try all the small burgers on the happy hour specials. We ordered \"one if each\" and even name each of them individually and they served us 5 of the same... We told them about it, they took it away and served us what we ordered 20mins later. The server who took our order didn't even come and apologize nor come to check in with us when we were eating. \nAnd... At the end... We paid cash thinking we can kill him with kindness... But he come back without the correct change, keeping all the coins..."}
{"input": "Michael is an awesome bartender! So personable and knows his drinks. The atmosphere here is great. It is calm and relaxing while still being enjoyable. I don't come to indianapolis often but I will be sure to come back here. Definitely enjoyable!"}
{"input": "Okay, I think I'm addicted. I'll never go to Chipotle again. Support a good local business with a super friendly staff! If you go enough, they for sure recognize you. I've been going once a week for a month. The burrito is so well-packed with the ingredients. Having tried a few combo's, I recommend the Spanish rice (comes with peas and corn). The chip salsa is awesome. Tough to not leave without a bag for the road. Try it out!"}
{"input": "This place has just gone down hill. It used to be that the Rivergate Ocharley's was the worst, now I feel like this one is on the same playing field. We have eaten at this one many times in hopes that \"maybe it was just a bad night\". Unfortunately, this seems to not be the case. Last night was the last time we will be customers at this location."}
{"input": "I cannot thank this Dobb's enough! Especially Keith. They did not carry the brand of tire on my car (Hankook) so he ordered it via courier as I needed my car fix the same day. When I had my car towed to their location, it was immediately serviced and I was in and out in about 30 minutes. Many thanks to Dobb's & Keith! Lifesavers."}
{"input": "Just tried the food. It was excellent, the best  I have had in the area. Had kung pao beef and basil shrimp with the pork fried rice all very good. Delivery was fast as well"}
{"input": "This is not an authentic sushi place.  If you are going to order spicy tuna and salmon then this the places for you, else wait for dinner and head over to Double Knot"}
{"input": "The pizza was awesome I really liked the dough.. it was so good. I gave it a 4 star because I didn't care for the hot wings. They had some sort of dry rub on them and not a sauce. I was literally burping up all the spices from it. Definitely would go back for the pizza though!!"}
{"input": "One of our favorite Mexican places in the area. It's close by and very reasonably priced. We especially love the guacamole, fajitas, tacos, orchata, and chimichangas. Everything is authentic, fresh, and tastes delicious. Though it's not a fancy dining room, it is clean and spacious. Check it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"input": "I would give them 5 but I was disappointed by their reuben.  \nFor some reason, I have to order reuben if it is a new place and the place has a reuben on their menu. \nbut the reuben's rye bread was disappointing considering that companion is all about the bread.  \n\nHowever, my fiancee's sandwich(forgot the name) with chicken, bacon, avocado on french bread was amazing!\n\nhad their spice chicken soup with their corn bread.  It was great! the soup had tons of vegetables and chicken, just the right amount of heat and the corn bread is pretty big and delicious.  \n\ntheir chi latte was not impressive.. do not get it. lol \n\nlittle pricey but, it's a great place to have a wonderful breakfast/lunch and the workers are nice and friendly. \n\ncheck this place out, let me know what you guys think."}
{"input": "the calm before the storm here at The \"gryph\"\nsoothing music, tasty food and interesting people."}
{"input": "Quack & Cheese is where it is at! We were there for the lunch menu. The duck fries are so delicious. It was my first time there & I ordered the portabello burger. They didn't have the right mushrooms & asked if a substitute was ok. I said sure. But I couldn't eat it. I asked for some kind of sauce & instead they let me order something else. That was so nice. I don't usually complain about anything. I felt like they really catered to our whole party. I would definitely love to come back for a date night."}
{"input": "Fantastic sliders!! Perfect size that you can try more than one!  Fried chicken slider, BLT slider, monte cristo and Cuban were all fantastic!  Now for Donuts to go!!"}
{"input": "Very Informative, took us to haunted places (that we were planning to see anyways) and gave us funfilled stories behind each place. Kept us listening all night!"}
{"input": "I discovered this bakery through yelp, and everyone was on point....the sweet bread from this panaderia is divine!!! The actual bakery is clean, bright, and festive...pi~natas hanging from the ceiling..it is right next to an ethinic market too. It is marveous to find such a cute mexican bakery in Nashville with courteous staff. My friend and I were going bonkers while picking our bread....they had salvadorean quesadillas!!"}
{"input": "We have been to so many different bbq places but this absolutely amazing the place is so colorful and laid back tried the beef brisket and smoked sausage and enjoyed it to the last bite. \nNext time we are in the mood for BBQ we know where we are going !"}
{"input": "Will never shop here again!!!\nMy best friend is getting married and I went in to find a bridesmaid dress. The staff wasn't super helpful and I got ignored until I went up and ask someone for help and told her what color of dress I was looking for. They said they didn't have any in stock but they could order a dress and it would be here in a week. So I sat down went through the style book and picked out the style of dresses I liked. The employ told me to leave my name and number and the manager would text me pictures of dresses with the prices that night. I never received a text or phone call from them. So about a week and a half later I called and asked them what was going on. The lady who answered the phone said she would leave a message and they would again call me back that night and get everything figured out. Let's just say it's been 3 weeks and I still haven't heard a word. The wedding is now in 2 weeks and luckily I was able to find a dress else where."}
{"input": "I love this place. I've started coming here once a week when my craving for bún gets too strong to resist. The staff is sweet, attentive, but also leaves you alone and allows you to really enjoy the food without having to constantly reassure them that, \"Everything's fine, food's great!\" Which is good when you're constantly chowing down on a mouthful of vermicelli noodles.\n\nI am not an expert on Vietnamese food in the slightest, so I don't know about the authenticity of the cuisine; all I know is it's good, fast, and a healthier option for lunch or dinner on Magazine."}
{"input": "We wanted to be impressed, but we just weren't. Seemed stuffy from the start. While checking in the 2 young girls spent an awkward amount of time finding our reservation. No \"We're glad you chose to dine with us\" or even a simple \"Good evening.\" The food was good, not great-we had the lobster Mac appetizer, 2 entrees (it's extra for any veggie sides) and a glass of wine and a beer-$180. It just didn't seem worth it."}
{"input": "Ew. I don't know what upsets me more, the borderline gross food or how much I had to pay for it. We waited forever to get into this place which served me a relatively tasteless burger on an incredibly soggy McDonald's quality bun and the saltiest fries I have ever eaten. Yes, truffle oil is delicious, but pouring it over burned, greasy fries does not a delicious, 16 dollar meal make. We won't be back."}
{"input": "I came to Barbarians on Sunday and Good God was I impressed! I have to say that everything me and my friends got was amazing. The pasta was delicious, the calzones were phenomenal, and the pizza was so good. \nThe prices totally didn't match the quality. Everything was fairly priced and totally had the customers wallet in mind. I was so happy to have a great meal for fairly cheap when me and my friends spent a good while walking down state st trying to find something decent to eat. \n\nI can't wait to come to Santa Barbara just for Barbarians again. \nBest pizza joint in town!"}
{"input": "I love this place. It's awesome for takeout on a weekday, and it's nice to have a Thai place in North County. I love all the noodle stir fry's. I recommend the banana wontons served with honey- They are on the appetizer menu but are great for dessert! I also really enjoy the sweet potato appetizer. The restaurant definitely lacks any ambience, but it has some really great food and is worth stopping by on a regular basis."}
{"input": "Went here for the first time on a double date after hearing good things about it around town. The food was fantastic for all of us, including quite possibly the best porkchop I have ever eaten. Very busy atmosphere, but the ambiance was great. There was a live band with an incredible female vocal who walked around and sang at a table of women celebrating a birthday. Very fun. \n\nI highly recommend this spot and have already made another reservation for our Anniversary!"}
{"input": "Stopped in for breakfast on our way to the French Quarter. I had a Build Your Own Scramble with cheddar cheese, andouille sausage and mushrooms. It came with a biscuit and breakfast potatoes (yum). Boyfriend got the Andouille Eggs Benedict, it looked and tasted wonderful. Bits of crawfish in there as well! Tasted fresh!"}
{"input": "Food was tasteless and bland. Biscuits and gravy were the worst ever. Maybe it was an off day for the cook but a little seasoning goes a long way. Food was fresh and hot but that was the only good thing about it. Average at best."}
{"input": "Frank Lovett was a very efficient and pleasant salesman.  He was able to assist us in\nall of our demands.   We have not yet had to deal with the service department and as far as\nI am concerned the company is only as good as the service it provides when you really need \nit.  So far, Crown Honda rates high."}
{"input": "i enjoyed the experience eating here and will definitely go back.\n\nfirst of all, there are vegetarian options on the menu. we started with the veggie spring rolls which were hot, crisp, and delicious. my husband had the duck and rice vermicelli soup which we both agreed was great in a yummy, savory broth. i had the beef pho which i didn't care for because the meat was a bit grisly and i'm not a fan of tripe. i've not eaten a lot of pho and wasn't sure what to order, though. they offer several different beef cuts and i should have picked a different one. next time. also, the regular serving size was way more than enough. i don't think either of us could have come close to finishing the largest bowls.\n\nthe restaurant was clean and quiet with a sparse, yet very 80s decor. the server was quick and attentive."}
{"input": "Good drinks and food. Had the pulled pork and fried chicken po boy. Mac and cheese was amazing. Very reasonable for the price. Great draft list as well. Serves food till1am."}
{"input": "I haven't stayed at the JW, but I've been twice to benefits at this hotel. The first, for Sheltering Wings, actually was the first event held there. I went to a gala last night for Gleaners, and was equally impressed both times. The staff is wonderful -- guiding you to your location in a way that isn't overbearing -- and the banquet space is lovely. The food is also tasty. I love the view of Victory Field, too, from the third floor. This really is a nice hotel for Indianapolis."}
{"input": "The dinner cruise pros: evening time is better for cooler weather and a great view of the city lights upon return upriver. \nThe dinner cruise cons: the food was nothing to write home about.\nMy suggestions: Eat a hearty meal onshore then opt for the cruise only. If you decide to do dinner, book early and get the first seating (you eat before the boat leaves shore and will be able to enjoy the outer decks for the rest of the time!) \nBe sure to seat yourself on the port (left side of boat), this is where you will see most of the interesting items pointed out by the announcer. \nBring your dancing shoes! The jazz-band is amazing! Also, be sure to walk back and view the paddle, and downstairs to view the engine room; they create a very unique experience! Also, free WiFi! \nMake sure to find a tour guide book- most have a $10 off coupon in then for the dinner cruise!"}
{"input": "Easy, quick and inexpensive way to get to LAX. I recommend their service to any travels as I've never had any problems."}
{"input": "I am not a designer, and honestly know nothing about prices of fabric, but I came here looking for some buttons to use in place of ones that had fallen off jackets. Their button selection is insane! I was completely overwhelmed. Probably whimpering a little, one of the salespeople took pity on me and helped me find the buttons I was looking for.  I'm pretty darn sure if they don't have the button you're looking for, you're probably out of luck"}
{"input": "When I called she put me on hold 3 times. Was very rude. Then when delivery came received wrong order. She wouldn't fix this, and hung up on me 3 times. Very rude and horrible service. Don't go there"}
{"input": "Great new location on Central. Great staff and atmosphere! Looks like they have found a place where they will thrive."}
{"input": "My boyfriend and I went for dinner on a Friday night. We sat at the chef's bar which allows you to see the food being prepared in the open kitchen. It was fun to watch until we noticed that one of the cooks was tasting the food with a spoon then continuing to use the spoon to cook the food. He did this with every dish he cooked, reusing the same dirty spoons to taste, stir, and serve everyone's food. We reluctantly ate our food anyway. It was tasty, but we both got sick the next day. Will never go there again. I would have said something to the head chef, but he was present in and around the kitchen the entire time, so I had to assume he saw this too and did not care."}
{"input": "I took my wedding dress to Suki's and left a very happy customer. Suki is a sweetheart and made my dress look better than I dreamed it could look. Thanks Suki!!"}
{"input": "NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL! After reading the reviews I'm left wondering did I eat at the same place?!?! The ambiance is nice. Very quaint, rustic, cozy...we ate outside since the weather was nice. Service was mediocre and the food was not great! The potatoes were the only thing I enjoyed. Everything else was mediocre. I probably will not be back!"}
{"input": "Wanted to try this place for the first time. We pick up a menu to order later. A few hours later we called for delivery. After placing our order we wanted to pay with a debit card. They told us they only take cards in the store. Delivery is cash only!!  I canceled the order and call gin house."}
{"input": "Drove by this place and decided to stop in while looking for a breakfast place and I'm so glad we did! The food was fantastic as was the coffee. The staff was very friendly and accommodating!"}
{"input": "Went here during vacation and it was amazing! So much so that we went back the next day. We have alligator bites and calamari as appetizer. The alligator bites are amazing with lemon, yum! I had oysters both days. 12 oysters for 9.99, so delicious. We also tried a crab trapper drink, it was ok but I'll I'm a beer kind of gal so I'm a little biased. Misty was our server, ask for me! She is an absolute delight and the sweetest ever."}
{"input": "The most amazing thing happened today.  I walked into Andres Richard Salon on Locust St for my appointment with Stephanie, a junior stylist at Andres.  We talked, I showed her pictures and the magic began.  I came in for a balayage, a fix from my existing washed out, brassy ombre.  Stephanie was so sweet, attentive and definitely catered to my request.  Hours later, my hair is exactly what I wanted!  I spent most of 2015 crying out of Salon after Salon.  This is will be the only person that will ever touch my hair again.\nIf you're looking for technical, creative, and expert hair care, you'll find it at Andres Richard."}
{"input": "The food and service is fantastic.  Everything is fresh and bursting with flavor. I will come back."}
{"input": "AaaaahhhhhMAZING!!!!! If you want the true flavor of New Orleans in a neighborhood diner full of ambiance... this is the place!!!\nThe sweet potato waffle is the best.... no wait, the pecan pancake - or maybe the banana pancake... and crab cakes... and chicken...  okay - it's ALL great!"}
{"input": "Don't go!!!! Walk a couple more feet and go to the Boardwalk Grill! Crowded crazy and definitely not clean.  We left immediately after being seated and walked a few steps to the Boardwalk Grill and had a great Lobsta roll with hand cut french fries."}
{"input": "I find that the food ranges from pretty good to excellent.\n\nThis location has recently been refurbished, and is a bit more refined than before.\n\nService is usually quite capable, but occasionally hits a snag- most often with a member of the waitstaff who seems inexperienced or under-trained."}
{"input": "Great location when the weather is good. Food was great and came out fast. The tacos looked tempting, but i had the pretzel burger and it was really good. They executed well - we will be back."}
{"input": "This was my first time eating at a Ruth Chris steakhouse, and I usually like to try a place more than once before making up my mind, but after the first visit, it is not on my top places to return to. The staff was nice enough but things just seemed off, unnatural, like a young girl trying to wear her mom's high heeled shoes, but maybe it was just this location.\n\nThe steaks were fine, sides were fine, everything tasted ok. Our food came out on sizzling plates that were literally too dangerous to touch. Up until the last bite, we hovered over our plates so we wouldn't be burned. Besides being dangerous to the touch, everything was covered and cooked in sooooo much butter. Some people may like that, but it was just too much for me."}
{"input": "We enjoyed our short stay here, and they DID give us cookies, which was nice.  A small minifridge in the room was helpful and saved us money and time."}
{"input": "I don't know how I lucked out with having this taqueria in our neighborhood, but this is the best Mexican food you'll get in New Orleans.\n\nWe discovered Taqueria Guerrero after finding that burrito joint down the street was packed, had a line wrapping around the buidling (you know which one!).\n\nAfter finding street parking near the mattress store, we plopped down and ordered the 3-taco plate (al pastor, mmmm) with beans and rice on the side and a burrito (barbocoa). I am a creature of habit and order the same tacos, but the bf has ventured out to get other dishes such as the fajita plate or the really spicy shrimp (camarones del diablo?). All very tasty.\n\nThe rest is history. It's embarrassing how often I suggest this place when we want to go out/get take out."}
{"input": "Very good food at a great price. Had the meatloaf and mashed potatoes. I will come back just for the potatoes.  Delicious!"}
{"input": "We have been to this location many times and always have a GREAT experience. Literally every time we are greeted by very friendly staff who will let you taste things before you order. We eat very healthy and appreciate the nice selection of healthy items. I am gluten free and have food intolerances and have always felt completely comfortable eating here. My food always comes out exactly as I ordered it even with all of the adjustments needed. \n\n5 stars for both food and service!!!"}
{"input": "The most friendly mom and pop coffee house ever. \nThe coffee is perfect and strong.\nThe pastries are yummy and moist. Worth the drive for me."}
{"input": "Had my daughter 's birthday party after dinner at the HARBOR! Our waitress was wonderful, all the staff helped pull it off. Even joined in the celebration, was very nice of them. Nothing could have made it better!! I just love to eat at THE HARBOR, family tradition still going strong."}
{"input": "I went to G. Thrapp just to get an estimate on repairing my sterling silver claddagh ring. It's a much lower-end piece of jewelry than they usually deal with, but nonetheless, the service was great, and everyone I talked to was very nice. The estimate for the ring repair was surprisingly high (two times what I had originally paid for the ring!), so I declined. But the store is very pretty and seems to have a nice selection. I'm not sure how the prices compare to other places, but I would come back the next time I'm in the jewelry market."}
{"input": "This is a pretty good pancake place, but it's a little disorganized in the way it's run when it's really busy. The pancakes are pretty good but super sweet, so you have to be in there. Good price point. Serves breakfast all day so that's definitely a plus, but not anything particularly special that you couldn't get anywhere else."}
{"input": "Came here tired of going to buffets and other buffets like locations. This was a few minutes walk from the Peppermill too.\n\nThe place was next to a few auto repair places and most likely are patronized by them. The food is but a low-quality Chinese food. They couldn't get our orders right the 1st time around and the 2nd time ordered a simple dish that tasted completely nasty."}
{"input": "If you're a Latino, you're best staying away from this place.\nThe lady that cut my hair was rude and very unprofessional."}
{"input": "I ordered the shaved zucchini salad- it had a blue cheese yogurt, candied beets, pistachios (I think?) and some greens. Kind of small for $12, but it was good!\n\nAlso had the beausoleil oyster with chopped cucumber and some kind of mignette- delightful and you can buy them individually so you don't have to get a full order like many places!\n\nThe rose sour cocktail was right up my alley- slightly sweet and made with bubbles- how could I not like it?\n\nWe also ordered the sorghum bacon- thick cut like pork belly- sweet sauce! Yummy! \n\nI really LOVE LOVE LOVE the decor and atmosphere here, eclectic industrial and slightly vintage- so super cute!  \n\nThe menu changes quite frequently so be sure to check back often!"}
{"input": "I am soooo happy I found Erzuile's Voudou.  I am honestly not even sure how I came across your website but I believe nothing is by chance.  I want to say how amazed I am at the quick and personal response I get when I ask a question about a product.  I have never experienced this type of service with anyone else before.  Really!!  This just goes to show the commitment and desire Erzulie's has to help their clients with whatever situation brings them to their website or store.   I wasn't sure how to approach two major concerns in my life so I spoke with one of the practitioners and she guided me with what to order.    And let me just tell you about the goats milk soap.  THE BEST soap I have ever used!  I just ordered two more bars!!"}
{"input": "Sierra and her sidekick, India, took impeccable care of my family last weekend during a family reunion.  We came to Santa Barbara from all over the world, and Sierra not only took care of purchasing everything we needed ahead of time, but she also thought of things we didn't think of, and went out multiple times to replenish drinks and food we went through.  They were flexible, fun, thorough and all-around fabulous.  I hope I have another event in Santa Barbara in the future, just so I can use JOTSB!"}
{"input": "Good food friendly folks\nDon't come in full.\nQuick and good portions\nGet the tips seating outside"}
{"input": "There's honestly nothing wrong with Famous Dave's and some people really like it... to me, it's not worth writing home about. (I went to a rehearsal dinner here last weekend) There were those big \"garbage pail lid\" platters all over with brisket, pulled pork, chicken, ribs, corn muffins, baked beans & cole slaw. I found the brisket and pulled pork to be a little dry... but there are lots of sauces at the table so you can slather it up if that's your thing. This may sound strange but my favorite parts of the meal were the cole slaw, baked beans & the bread pudding for dessert. \n\nService: Keep in mind I was there with a BIG group but.. our waiter seemed pretty overwhelmed, poor guy!\n\nTip: Don't waste your time with the margaritas - VERY sweet, not much tequila flavor at all."}
{"input": "This is an updated review. I've been ordering from silver mine's at the same location for the last 4-5 years and they have only gotten progressively worse. Don't ask for anything to be added to your soup or chili; they'll charge you for the additions but will not include them in the order. They'll also most likely to include the free side such as the bread. It literally takes at least an hour to get your food delivered, maybe they should call Jimmy Johns and ask the what their secret is. This business is in major trouble with all of the other options available. The service is worse than if you had a bunch of kindergarteners running the business, at least they would be nice. You guys are right next to Eller Business School, why don't you ask them how you can improve??? Currently, this place is an embarrassment to their industry, and a waste of space on University Blvd. NEVER ORDERING FROM THIS PLACE AGAIN."}
{"input": "Either ate or had drinks here a few times over the summer as my office was just upstairs.  I'm not a vegetarian, but the Goodness wrap is a knockout.  I also greatly enjoyed the chili I had here, though it was a special so I'm not sure how often it comes around.  I'm not really into the hipster vibe of the staff, but I never had any service problems and that's what is most important.  \n\nI definitely don't live or die by The Bricks but it's a place I would suggest if you're ever in Ybor City."}
{"input": "I'm only giving this place a one star for the convenience since it was next to my hotel.  I should have either saved my money or eaten at the gas station down the street!  I ordered the Asparagus soup with crab meat, green beans, and chicken salad wrap.  Well I couldn't even swallow one taste of the soup, yes I had to spit the mystery goo out. Tasted spoiled!!  The chicken salad had no flavor at all and was very dry. As I picked through it I found a lot fat. A total waste of money. The food ruined my appetite!!"}
{"input": "our go-to place for a special coriander sauce. this grocery store is very over-looked, and a good place to go for unique Indian ingredients and food that you can't find anywhere else."}
{"input": "4/5 gem\n\nI love this place. Whenever I'm here, I feel like I'm wrapped up in the heart of New Orleans. It's a quintessential neighborhood bar. I couldn't resist springing for their little blue cup (which looks like \"Cal\" go bears!!) - I love seeing it around the house. The do enforce the noise levels, so keep it all inside. Overall super friendly and one if the favorites."}
{"input": "We arrived when it just opened...about 10 more tables came in.  ALL were served before us even though we were the first to arrive and place our orders.  The pot stickers were BLACK...so burnt the taste transferred to the rest of the food.  When we told the management about it, she replaced only 4 of the order of 6 because we had tasted two of them. (a couple other tables ordered them too....and theirs were burned too)   Our  Mongolian beef was dry and burnt also.  Once again management would not adjust our ticket.  The owner just smiled when we voiced our concerns.  The wait staff is treated terribly by the owner.  She is RUDE.  I don't want to go back because I refuse to pay for burnt food.  Shame as I've been there before and it was excellent.  INCONSISTENT !"}
{"input": "I have been here several times now and I can truly say it's the best $22 pedicure I've ever gotten. You get better service and work here than at places that charge twice as much. They are always very nice, polite and clean....no matter how busy....and that says a lot. I used to go to the expensive day spas because I thought you just got better quality, but now I don't see the point in paying so much. I will definitely be a continued customer at this facility."}
{"input": "Good food, great service.  Hard to beat.  One of the best restaurants in Indianapolis."}
{"input": "Food was nothing special.  Sides were cafeteria style nothing seemed home made.  Fried Chicken was the best thing."}
{"input": "I'm visiting St. Louis for a few days and had a taste for Indian food! I decided to opt out of some of the more expensive restaurants in favor of this restaurant. I am glad I did! This place is a little deceiving (its a small restaurant in a strip mall) but boy, does it deliver. Everyone I went with enjoyed the food, it was fresh and extremely delicious. Not to mention, quite affordable! The owner was friendly to boot. Check this place out for a really good meal!"}
{"input": "This is some good motherfuckin ice cream.\n\nPositive:\n+Tell me you're serving bananas foster today!\n+Freshly made waffle cones\n+Establishment doesn't look like a fucking kindergarden.  I can eat ice cream and still feel like an adult\n+Owner is a Harvard grad, but isn't a stuck up asshole.  Actually seems pretty down to earth and can hold a conversation with the layman.\n\nNegative:\n-I'm reaching, but I kinda wish this place was located by the movie theater.  Would be nice to park once and make this part of an evening out.  The only time I really think about this place is after rolling out of Publix and by then I've already got bags of frozen food thawing out and dont have time for ice cream.  Not even some bad ass ice cream.\n\nHey... even 5 star joints could use some constructive criticism"}
{"input": "Great food, very helpful staff, small menu.  The clam bisque was the best, I also enjoy the fried oyster salad.  These two sides were enough food for me.  Salad had a little to much thick bacon chunks for me."}
{"input": "Once again I tried this place because my wife liked it. Semi good food but very poor service. Where do they get some of these waitresses? Our waitress with a long braided blonde ponytail could only walk by us flirting with another waiter. She never even asked us anything until we were ready to leave. Very disappointed once again!!!"}
{"input": "Italian food is one of my favorite types of food I love to eat.  So of course I am a fan of Olive Garden chan restaurants!! This particular Olive Garden is in a great location and is always busy.  However, even though it is always busy the service, and drinks are always on point.  My girls and I love to go there for their amazing sangrias.  The food is just like all the others... yummy and fast."}
{"input": "This review is for the Louis Vuitton store in Holt Renfrew. I was helped by Onice and Jennifer Ho. The service was excellent and reminded me why I save most of my LV shopping for this store. Thanks again ladies for your help and above-and-beyond service. I really appreciate it.\nPaula."}
{"input": "Had salmon burger that was delicious. Server Emily was great. Saturday morning early without much of a crowd. Truffle fries really good."}
{"input": "Meh. It was ok. The meatloaf is more like medallions, and the tuna ahi salad was more like a steak . The place for was very noisy on a Friday night, and the crowd was very yound (as in 22 tops)"}
{"input": "Best pizza on lower Main Line; great friendly staff"}
{"input": "We had drinks outside at the poolside tiki bar. The bartender was a miserable prick. Come on Safety Harbor Resort...you can hire better help than that curmudgeon."}
{"input": "Very overpriced for literally HALF a panini. Incredibly disappointed. Won't be back. Forty bucks for me and the kids and even the kids were still hungry."}
{"input": "Best meal this vacation. The service by Malik was outstanding!!  We enjoyed a Mediterranean sampler appetizer.  Lamb kebabs, lamb tagine, and lobster pasta for entrees. The food was fabulous. The atmosphere was as good as it gets. Highly recommended this for a special dining experience."}
{"input": "Newfields is one of my favorite attractions in Indianapolis! The art is spectacular and there is a good rotation and variety of exhibits. My favorite part is the garden, which is beautiful year round. The admission is a bit pricey, but you receive pretty good value for what you pay. If you're not looking to pay admission, you can go for free on the first Thursday of every month.\n\nMy boyfriend and I went this past Thursday while the Beer Garden was open. There was a good selection of craft beer and a few delicious charcuterie boards to enjoy. We decided to make a visit to the beer garden every month during the summer. It makes for a fun date night! \n\nIf you're visiting Indy or have family coming into town, definitely head on over to Newfields. Oh, and bring some good walking shoes!"}
{"input": "The worst customer service, the guy that was serving me looked like he was the manager , I asked him if I can have a fresh chicken on my plate , instead of the ones that were sitting there for god knows how long, and he said they all look the same , and didn't even try to please his customer!!! I will never go back to this place , poor quality customer service ...."}
{"input": "After our recent trip to New Orleans, I came back to Reno appreciating this place even more than before! \nThe shrimp po boy is my favorite thing on the menu! And their corn bread is amazing as well!"}
{"input": "This place is a gem.  My favorite spot in the funk zone to hang out, especially on a Sunday afternoon. Sip on a glass of wine or try a beer sampler- whatever you are in the mood for! They have both, unlike most wine tasting spots around there. If it's a chilly day, warm up by the cozy fireplace and relax by the lounge area... or if it's a warm day you can people watch on the wrap-around porch in the front.  Corks and Crowns is a classy, friendly place for locals and visitors alike.  And they are dog friendly. Did I mention they also have cupcake pairings for your sweet tooth? So decadent and tasty... I think I'll head over there now..."}
{"input": "Fantastic Detroit family has joined the revolution of Madeira Way! Incredibly friendly staff with authentic Italian cuisine! The venue is the former Subway location and well move over Fast food subs and dive in to a REAL Italian sub! This place will be very successful!"}
{"input": "I was really disappointed in my experience. The drinks were great, but the food was mediocre, and the service was awful. We never received our appetizers, and we barely saw our waiter. I'd go back for just the cocktails."}
{"input": "I'm so conflicted by this review.  If you go for drinks, I give this place 5 stars.  The ambiance doesn't get any better. The lighting will have you swooning! The drinks are great and often they feature a drink that benefits a different organization in the community. And then there's the truffle popcorn! It's the perfect  pairing for a swanky cocktail and it's complimentary.  \n\nThen there's the food. Honestly, everything I've eaten here has been mediocre. The Devour Downtown was especially disappointing. The value just wasn't there for a tiny fancy grilled cheese or cheese calzone- basically just cheese and bread for $25pp.  I'd skip the food but remember Platt 99 for your next date night drink or happy hour."}
{"input": "We came here as a recommendation from a friend who lived in NOLA. This was by far one of the best places we stopped during our trip. The Iced Vanilla Latte was sooooooo good! Also, the Chicken Salad was by far the best salad I have EVER had! Luckily we stopped here on our way out of New Orleans so I bought an extra one for the trip home-- that's how good it is! My husband got a chocolate donut and breakfast taco and thought they both were super delicious. We also bought a king cake to take home since we heard such good things about theirs. Whenever we come back to NOLA this will be one of our first stops. It's my new favorite coffee joint! Please think about expanding and opening up one in Houston, Tx!"}
{"input": "Absolutely the greatest ice cream that I have ever had! Went on an extremely busy night, but the employees remained friendly and were prompt with the service. We ended up getting the four mini scoops, which was enough to share. We tried the Cookie Monster, Creole Cream Cheese, I Scream Fudge, and the Cafe au Lait. There were all incredible and accurately represented the area. Fair prices and unbelievable flavors. Looking forward to coming back to try different flavors again."}
{"input": "This was my first time dining at Ava and I enjoyed most of it. We ordered the Ricotta cheese & toasted bread and although the flavor was excellent, I thought the bread to cheese ratio was off quite a bit. The ricotta came in a tiny ramekin typically reserved for flavored butters, so I expected more for an appetizer. \n\nThe two pizzas split among a couple of people were the sausage and the potato with rosemary. They were both tasty but I think they forgot the Rosemary on ours. Still yummy, tho! Another entree was the grouper w/Israeli couscous. Scrumptious!\n\nDessert was a must and the zeppoles, or sugared donuts, were amazing. The cherry tart a little less so, but one person at our table loved it, so maybe it was just not my cup of tea. The cherries were a sort of candied cherry-interesting, but sweet with a very dense crust. Again, just not my personal fave. \n\nI will definitely return to try other menu items that looked great-like the pastas made in-house daily...that's next!!"}
{"input": "Real Mexican food - rated highly by Craig LaBan recently in the Indie Chain restaurant category and well deserved. It all about the sauces and meat prep for me and this place deserves 5 stars for both. Try everything according to your ability to handle spice. The chicken mole enchiladas are my fave of faves. Simple tacos with onions and spiced meat are delicious. Simply put, if you have a hankering for Mexican, you will delighted at El Limon!!"}
{"input": "This ballpark is a 5 star experience. Srsly. There is not a seat in the house with a shit view. You know what makes this place even better? The Phillies don't suck anymore. But really, the ballpark is tops. The hotdogs are more like hotdog hoagies, the beer is expensive, but they have good options. You dont have to settle for shit beer as they have a few different microbrews on tap. \n\n\ngo get it."}
{"input": "I had lunch here a few days back and was surprised it wasn't as busy as I thought it would be.  All those in my group order a sandwich for lunch and they all looked good and it was confirmed that they tasted good.  I took the other road and ordered the special of the day.  Tutto Mare with Caesar salad as a sub.  Although it was an upcharge it was nice to know that they didn't.  The dressing was the best I've had in awhile.  The pasta was very good and the sauce seemed to taste as though it was from scratch.  The only downside was the shrimp on the dish was shell on.  Its the first time I've had it with the shell on.  Although it was good it was very messing peeling the shrimp covered with a cream/alfredo sauce.  I'd go back for the sandwich/burgers but not sure about anything trying to be upscale.  The pretzel bites with cheese sauce were very tasty."}
{"input": "The best gelato and very good pizza.\nWe came between brunch and dinner, so ate at bar. Had a bottle of the \"best pizza wine\"'and liked,it. Ordered two pizzas for the three of us. Plenty. And I eat a lot of pizza.\n\nPizza reminds me very much of Vetri, and similarly priced (expensive). Excellent ingredients. The style has a soft middle crust, almost white and underdone (to me) which apparently is authentic. Otherwise I would ask for a little more well done, but that might be an insult. You tuck and fold the middle to eat.  I mean, it's delicious, but I feel I shovel too much in that way and lose the individual taste of the fabulous toppings. The outside crust was  puffy and tender.\n\nNice bartender service and he was really runnng around. I think it was a surprisingly busy day downtown. The gelato is always amazing. I'm in a rut. I always get the Thai coconut and something chocolate or coffee. Some day I will have had my fill of coconut and try other flavors. No I won't!"}
{"input": "Totally non-dog friendly, unlike 95% of Manayunk.   Ashame since it's accross from the dog park.  I'll be giving my $ to the dog friendly Main Street Market from now on."}
{"input": "Came in for a mid-week lunch with a co-worker.\n\nService is casual, on the friendly (but brisk) side, which was not a problem. The presentation isn't fancy, it's definitely simple with light decor.\n\nI ordered a croque-monsieur, which came nicely toasty with a generous helping of sliced tomatoes. The sandwich itself was quite nice, with flavorful ham. Unfortunately, the tomatoes were on the mealy side and didn't add much to the plate.\n\nOverall a very middle-ground experience, perhaps another dish will hit the right spot some other time. Definitely a big plus that they are attached to La Baguette-- treat yourself on the way out."}
{"input": "Definitely top rated Sushi in my book! The fish is incredibly fresh, they do not overwhelm you with rice, and they have awesome specials on week nights. The sushi chefs are very attentive and give you super fast service! The ambiance is tranquil and the restaurant is very clean...if you haven't been to sushi Rose, this is a MUST try!"}
{"input": "This is truly a hidden gem of a place up up in the mountainous windy roads in Santa Barbara.\n\nThe place looks like an old cabin from the outside, and as soon as you enter the door, the first things that you'll notice is the dim lighting and the real fire in the fireplace, crackling away. There is a super old rustic feel to the decor, and the bear hide hanging across the wall really completes this place as an old rustic tavern for weary travellers...but in this case, it was more for locals and tourists. \n\nThe food was interesting as we ordered the rabbit, the elk, and venison meats! To my surprise, nothing was gamey and the meat was actually tender and juicy. \n\nThis was definitely a good experience and as many others have mentioned, it is a good place for a romantic date and/or it is also good for a group of friends to hang out and relax.\n\nCheck it out!"}
{"input": "We stopped in after picking my friend up at the airport. I should have read the reviews before hand as we experienced the SAME ISSUES on undercooked steaks! I should have known it was going to happen as the server asked us to cut into our steak while she waited. Both were supposed to be medium and they came out blue rare!! Now we have cut into them so all the juices exit the meat and upon re-cooking the steaks became dry. During our meal I noticed the table next to us had sent back their steaks as well due to under cooking!\n\nDoes a national chain not have the ability to properly cook a steak??? I think not........"}
{"input": "I recommend Jean Madeline to anyone who is not overly sensitive regarding their hair, and is looking for an affordable cut and color.  The hairdressers are all friendly and eager to please; the advantage of coming here is that they really want you to leave happy, so if you ask for just the slightest trim or any other precise instructions, they definitely listen.  I come here for trims and repair treatments, which all come in under $20. The space is clean attractive and gets the job done."}
{"input": "I am very tall, and like many tall people, have had more than my share of back issues. As such, I've gone to a dozen different chiropractors over the years. Jester is my favorite, and will be yours also.\n\nThe staff are very friendly and welcoming, and they go above and beyond to make sure that your insurance, scheduling and time waiting are comfortable and easy.\n\nThe doctors are top notch with both their ability to help you, their easygoing bedside manner, and the fact that they don't sign you up for an extremely long \"plan\" that requires you to get \"healthy\" for a minimum of 30 visits in the next 4 months... from years of experience with them, you can trust these guys. \n\nSo, a doc that you can trust, that has a great staff, and with an easy manner... all good things, right?"}
{"input": "love the new machines \nnice and air conditioned \nclean \nthe owner is super funny \ndefinitely my new place"}
{"input": "We were told to go here by a friend. They did not disappoint. The food was fresh, fast and delicious. Super huge portions too big for me. Wish they had half portions -- ended up throwing most of mine away and felt wasteful. But if you are a big eater go for it."}
{"input": "Gee, Normands. It would have been nice if you had seen fit to update your website with the fact that you are closed for construction during a good chunk of August. \n\nThat way, my husband and i wouldn't have wasted time trying you this morning. Good thing Craft Beer Market was open. \n\nSeriously. Add a freaking contact page to your website with important stuff like hours and you know, CLOSURES? \n\nOnce my husband has been burned by a place, it is nearly impossible to get him to return, so chances are, you may have lost him (us) for good."}
{"input": "Yummy food and fair prices for the Montecito area! Stopped by after a hike and enjoyed a glass of wine and veggie salad. Good service. Great ambiance."}
{"input": "Great, local breakfast joint. Great diner feel, with tasty breakfast food including classics and classics with a twist! I got the steak and eggs and it did not disappoint. Plus, the shrimp and corn soup (their specialty) was really yummy, even for breakfast. Worth checking out if in the Old Jefferson hood."}
{"input": "It's good diner food. period.\n\nNothing fancy, just simple food made well. Breakfast is a must. Homemade Belgium waffle covered in TONS of fruit....amazing.\n\nSimple Said...it's good diner food at a good price with friendly waitresses. On a Saturday morning...what more could you ask for?!"}
{"input": "After living in Broad Ripple for 10 years we finally tried this little gem of a restaurant for breakfast and woah were we blown away! First of all the service was top notch! Kind, friendly, and fast! Second, the food...holy moly was it good! My husband had the huevos rancheros and I had their signature biscuits skillet and I literally cannot wait to go back!"}
{"input": "I went back here and either I didn't remember the prices  (because someone else had paid last time) or their prices had gone up. It was almost $20 for 2 basic sushi rolls!! While the portions are big, they aren't filling enough to justify such a high price for 2 rolls for lunch. Will not be coming back at those prices."}
{"input": "Cute, quirky, and delicious!  Conveniently located in the Hillsboro area. Great staff, fast and friendly.  The food oh yes! Awesome. Try the East Nasty and get that side of pickles!! The parking is okay for downtown too and will get better once the neighboring construction completes."}
{"input": "Ate lunch here for the first time, and overall it was a good meal at a decent price and it was fast.\n\nI ordered the NY Strip Teriyaki Bento Box which came with the NY Strip in a nice teriyaki sauce on a bed of green peppers and onions, with miso soup, a California roll, white rice and a house salad with ginger dressing.  I asked for the steak to be cooked medium rare, and it was definitely on the rare side.  It was good, the cali roll was good and the ginger dressing was... good.  The service was very good and fast.\n\nEverything was good, but nothing was spectacular.  So... 4 stars."}
{"input": "Stopped for lunch today at the new Kawa on Sproul Road. The simple and spare Japanese décor suggested an interesting meal. The menu offers a wide variety but we settled on the 9.95 lunch specials.\nThe sushi rolls, delicately set out, offered a clean and distinct taste variety. The chicken teriyaki, served with miso soup, two delicate dumplings and rice provided a tasty experience. The service, attentive and prompt, rounded out a reasonably priced and enjoyable lunch on a rainy day. Judging from our dishes I would imagine that dinners would be equally enjoyable."}
{"input": "I had a meeting here on a weekday mid-morning.  Maybe not the best place for a business meeting (or for getting work done), as it was super loud (other patrons and music).  But a great place nonetheless!  A little pricey, but you pay for what you get.  My chai (with almond milk - yay!!) was very good.  And that gluten free peanut butter cookie was out of this world good - wouldn't have known it was GF if it hadn't been labeled as such.  The food looked good and I hope to have a chance to come back and try it!"}
{"input": "Food is great.  I am hooked on the halva puri, which is only available on sat/sun"}
{"input": "Come here for delicious, home style New Orleans cuisine. We went in the afternoon, and although it was full, we were lucky and a table was ready right away. We did the a la carte as opposed to the buffet. It was our favorite meal of the trip!"}
{"input": "Wow this was proof that Texans can't BBQ it was at best a warm attempt at southern BBQ meat only had a slight smokey flavour, pulled pork was dry  the slaw had zero dressing, the bean I spit out sweet garlic unpleasant taste,the potato salad the dressing was good ... the side ribs were whacked off and tossed on top of everything  did I bother the owner by going in to buy food about as personable as getting bunched in the face,last when a person comes into your BBQ joint no take home sauce I give fired up a D-  needs major improvements and to the pony tail goof go buy a personality  there was only one BBQ king and he passed away four yrs.ago Smokey Joe would have told ya take your ass back to Texas"}
{"input": "This place is sub par at best. I've had better pancakes at my local diner. I ordered the blueberry pancakes thinking they would be these fluffy pancakes oozing of warm delicious blueberries. Well, they were about silver dollar size and had like 3 blueberries per pancake- I kid you not! Don't get duped like we did. Go somewhere else! Not even close to worth the wait."}
{"input": "The food was good, that's the only reason they got 2 stars! The hostess was less then enthusiastic and barley greeted us when we were being seated. The waitress only checked on us once after serving our food. The hostess came around with water and saw my husbands glass was empty but he had sprite. Rather than getting one for him or informing the waitress we waited for another 10 minutes and flagged the waitress down for the bill. Also some attention needed to be given to cleaning. All the doors were covered in handprints, the floors had swirl marks from mopping with a less than clean mop and the light fixtures and air vents were dusty. We aren't from the area and had to decide between barbecue and the Chinese place in the plaza. Should have gone with Chinese!"}
{"input": "I want to love this place due to the location and proximity to my house, but there's some things lacking...Positives: the food and service are both excellent. Flavorful dishes and friendly attentive staff. Downsides: the interior is very sterile and uninviting. The owners desperately need to invest in an interior designer or Feng Shui expert. Kitchen was slow seeing as the only cooked item was the steak salad."}
{"input": "After waiting 40 min to get in....\n-Hot breakfast served cold.\n-Food not prepared as requested (requested sausage links burnt, even after sending them back still not as requested. Eggs requested as over-medium, whites were runny).\n-had to ask for refills on coffee.\n-waitress seemed apathetic to deficiencies.\n-once finished, we waited more than 10 minutes to get check, long enough to write , review and post this review.\n-$40 (simple) breakfast for two."}
{"input": "A menu that satisfies everyone's cravings! Clean, trendy, and delicious! I definitely recommend going early (before 9 am) as the wait tends to get longer after 9 am! But honestly, it is soooo worth the wait. You will leave there feeling so incredible satisfied!"}
{"input": "We have been meaning to go here for quite a while, and shame on us. A wonderful dining experience. Great food, wonderfully presented by gracious and knowledgeable servers.  We started with a shrimp corn dog, just because it sounded fun!  The mushroom soup was superb and the sucking pig did not suck!  Desserts are whimsical and wonderfully prepared. Not to much either!  Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"input": "Great coffee! The atmosphere is inviting and playful. They are pet friendly and always full of loyal customers who aren't shy about engaging you in conversation. The Iced Almond mocha latte change my perspective about flavored coffee drinks. \n\nIf you are a iced coffee fan be sure to try their Nitro Coffee!"}
{"input": "ABSOLUTE CRAP!!!! I swiched after one night to the Hotel Intercontinental a REAL hotel!... The rooms are straight from the '70's no renovation. The happy hour was a JOKE and the food was groosssss. UGH"}
{"input": "We arrived at the hotel late Sunday night. (Thanks to the poor drivers who caused an accident near Ocala on I-75!)  The room was comfortable and the wifi was good. No complaints with the bathroom. Breakfast was yummy. This hotel is in the middle of a corporate office park, about a mile from I - 75. We had no issues with a late check-out. The staff was helpful."}
{"input": "Complicated ordering process. Pastries here. Hot line there. Menu items at the cashier (who was making salads and not available for several minutes).  Greasiest bacon I've seen in quite some time. Two people with nothing special, regular coffees, $26. Too much $ for too little service and quality. Used to be much better back in the day."}
{"input": "Awesome little cruise around the Tampa waterways. Food was very good. Our waitress was very kind and the chef even came out to talk to us (in a good way). Would definitely recommend."}
{"input": "Awful - long wait times, slow service, out of ingredients, and orders filled sloppily and incorrectly. Go down the street to the one on York Road near the mall."}
{"input": "This is my husbands and my first time here in Reno. Wow what a great hotel to stay in for your first time. We had a great room with a spa and the shower had a steam room feature. The hotel also offered many places to eat and relax. The casino was very clean and a joy to be in even if you don't gamble like myself. However I did win 41.00 with a 1.00 slot machine :)  we decided to venture out finally to see Reno. However, we weren't impressed with anything else but our great hotel.  Easy checkout right from the room was a time saver. Well now off to explore Reno some more.\nIf your considering a hotel that is nice, clean, up to date this is the one."}
{"input": "Really great service. \n\nAnd yes the onion soup is the best in Orlando."}
{"input": "Definitely a great place to hangout on a hot SUnday afternoon. Plenty of people watching, boats floating, live music and good times to be had. Yes, there are lots of stupid human tricks here but the security guys keep it tight and have an eagle eye for anything dangerous or illegal. \n\nNot something I'd do every week, but for the occassional visit to debauchery land, I'll go here."}
{"input": "We have often eaten at this Chili's and I've had what I thought were excellent ribs - \"fall off the bone good\".  However, yesterday we stopped for dinner there and I had a Custom Combo comprising a half rack of Chili's \"Original\" ribs and grilled salmon with sides of mashed potatoes and broccoli.  The ribs were tough and poorly prepared, clearly not slow cooked -  and just not very flavorful.  The mashed potatoes were rather gummy - the broccoli and salmon were OK.  Service was good - we had an attentive and friendly waiter but he could not make up for a below average meal.  Not sure we will go back again."}
{"input": "Stopped in right after flying in and this will probably now be my first stop coming out of MSY from now on. Fresh bread for the sandwich and quality stuff!"}
{"input": "Great food, great atmosphere, great service. I've been here twice, and neither was a disappointment. The food is always fantastic (if a bit on the pricey side) - maybe it's because I'm a sucker for Nutella, but the Belgian Waffle topped with Nutella is Heaven for your mouth."}
{"input": "My boyfriend and I dined here after buying a \"Summer in the City\" discount card for Tucson. We'd been wanting to try out new restaurants, this one included, so the added discount gave us that extra push. Everything about our experience was great. We were seated immediately and our waiter came by shortly after. He gave great recommendations on the wine and the specials. I ordered the pasta dish of the day, which was so fabulous. He had  the Bouillabaisse which was also delicious. We were too full for dessert but the ones we saw being carried to other tables looked amazing! Our server was very attentive but not overbearing. The atmosphere was lovely--intimate but still had the feeling of being in a public place, which we like. It was a great experience."}
{"input": "While I generally support independent restaurants over chain places,I still don't buy into the overpriced center city Phila hype. The place was actually roomier than the south Philly closets we usually take my mother in law for her birthday,but the prices were jaw dropping...quite different from the online menu. The food and portions were ok,and the dessert was something different than the average places. The bus help was a bit out of sync with the waiter,as they were asking us if we were done with our plates just as the waiter was telling us the desserts,and as the Philly standard the bathroom was a bit small to accomodate the size of the place."}
{"input": "Went on a google/yelp search.  I had been to the Italian Market a few times and did not know that it existed.  All I can say is WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE?????   Ordered a couple of pounds of Broccoli Rabe sausage and 4 aged strips.  My sons were raised on top end places for steak and asked me to go back for their birthday dinners.... well I am on my way today to pick up a few large steaks for the Q.  NOT CHEAP - but as with most things in life you get what you pay for.  I will be standing in the snow cooking tonight!!!!!"}
{"input": "My husband & I went to use a Groupon that I bought for him for Father's Day & it was a great time! The Groupon had expired but they let us use the amount paid for the Groupon as a credit towards anything at the bar. We each had a flight and the beer was good!"}
{"input": "Amazing restaurant near the Jefferson school/Center City. Their dumplings are so good, as well as their cheeseburger buns. My favorite entree to get is the Coconut Curry noodles with the addition of Pork Belly. Oh my god I think I'm going to have to get some now!"}
{"input": "I adore In-N OUt burgers - get them animal style or try them in a lettuce wrap (protein style).  They've got a special menu not listed (http://www.in-n-out.com) and their fries are amazing - you can actually taste the potato in them.  Their menu is very basic but it's all you need - burgers, fries, and shakes."}
{"input": "You will have to stand in line, you will have to squeeze onto a wooden bench with a lot of strangers, you will not have heat or a/c and .... it is worth it.  This is such a fun jazz show and such a cool space - you have to try it at least once and I am betting that if you go once, you will go again.  This place is legendary!"}
{"input": "Yummy food,  they will veganize things for you as well. The servers are friendly and the restaurant is spacious and has a bar and a stage area. We have had our work Holiday party here for the past couple years, both parties turned out great. The guacamole is awesome!"}
{"input": "Ichicoro Ane gets lots of things right and the best part about it is the combination of the ambiance with the food choices and whiskey selection. I'm very happy with this location and the servers I have encountered so far have been helpful and pleasant.\n\nThe katsu is great and I highly recommend it to people looking for a more filling dish on the menu. The bao buns were also good for a lighter fish. I haven't had anything I really regretted trying, but definitely ask your server about the portion sizes of each dish since they vary across the menu.\n\nThe cocktail selection is excellent. I even had a special Japanese Old Fashioned last time which was a little expensive, but well worth it for some quality Japanese whiskey. \n\nI'm looking forward to exploring the menu little by little. The best way to experience this is in a group setting so you can try more things and it really reminds me of Izakayas or Japanese pubs I visited in Japan and Korea."}
{"input": "I Love it here. The pizza is fantastic,  and the staff is very friendly. It's a great place to hang out with friends and family."}
{"input": "In the heart of my hood; I adore crescent park. Out of towners should check it out for the views alone. Clean, well-maintained, and fresh flowers keep me coming back for more. I love the \"softer\" running paths that give the knees a Lil' break! A great compliment to an wonderful corner of our city. The dog run is also a plus (water fountain and all!)."}
{"input": "This is a must get when you come to Reno is Yellow Subs. Ask for the sprouts on your sub and you won't regret it. It is way better then  anywhere I've ever been. The people are totally down to earth and always are nice and Stack your sub with only the best. Only the best and I recommend this to anyone who loves subs and loves food. Oh and there Tank Tops and T-shirts, priceless, I have a tank myself and represent it anywhere I go. Will be going there again in the future. 5 stars because the service was fast, people were nice, food was amazing, seating made you feel closer to your peers with more conversation movement back and forth and a great environment."}
{"input": "Let me start by first saying there are many better dinning options in the area. I have visited this place 5 times and only ate there twice.  It's best to have reservations due to almost an hour wait times from 5-8\nEven if they have many open tables open and clean they will not seat you without at least a 30minute wait and It's best to have a party of more than 2 so as to avoid getting stuck in the extremely crowded and loud area of the bar or by the kitchen in a cramped booth and so that the waitresses will pay enough attention to you and get your order in within an hour.  Despite them having almost the worst service of almost any place Ive been to the food is very good but overpriced and small portioned for some dishes."}
{"input": "Amazing gluten free Acai bowl. I just got almonds instead of the granola. What an amazing concept for a restaurant. I highly recommend going here - very healthy, very fresh and you can tell they are proud of what they serve. Very unique and worth a trip.\n\nwww.glutenfreechickie.com"}
{"input": "Just a quick update to note that Yelp's hours for this restaurant are incorrect. CL closes between brunch/lunch and dinner. The correct hours are on the restaurant website. Yelp, please fix this!"}
{"input": "Quaint and inviting.  This is a beer lover's tasting room.  A wide variety  of delicious beers to drink and enjoy.  This is a happy addition to this amazing neighborhood."}
{"input": "This review is to commend John at the Oregon Avenue store who is amazing. I went to the store looking for a food my very finicky recently adopted dog with diarrhea would eat. I tried 4 foods already (most expensive available) and she hated everything. After I told John my dilemma specifics and showed him a picture of my girl he immediately recommended Bil Jac. He mentioned shepherds are known for stomach sensitivities and feeds it to his shepherd. Addie Pray loves this food plus it's less than half the price of the other food I was giving her. It's too soon to see if the diarrhea has resolved but just finding a decent quality (not the best) food she will eat is half the battle. THANKS JOHN!! \n\nI would give 5 stars but they sell live animals which I am totally against!!!"}
{"input": "Good B&B style hotel, reasonably priced. Great location, close to beach, State Street, and Urban wine trail. A little noisy, but not a big problem. Would stay there again."}
{"input": "Fast and friendly service! Yes, it's a bit expensive, but great when you don't have time to wait around. They did try to upsell me on a few things, but I appreciated that they did not lean on me."}
{"input": "The food, the service, the price, the ambiance, all are perfect.  Every item on the menu we tried was delicious and it's healthy besides. The owners say lots of love goes into their food and it sure tastes like it. Highly recommended."}
{"input": "Quick service at prime time on a Saturday afternoon. Most of the service and food were good. Apps and main courses came out all together. I would not recommend the fried ravioli, it tasted frozen and the meat inside was not appetizing. Lasagna was a good balance of sauce, meat and noodles."}
{"input": "was on a mission to go to a hookah bar after coming home from the navy, after calling countless places ended up at fez great service friendy people. came here on two occasions to smoke hookah. first night great service super friendly and everything loved the waiter. helped me with everything me and my friends needed. second time on the other hand was horrible. I called ahead of time and asked them what time they were closing they replied 1130 but they kicked me and friends out at 11. we also asked if they mind if we bring in alcohol (byob) they said its fine even if they have a bar. after we brought some in they told us to take it out or we have to leave. that was my experience ."}
{"input": "Very good sushi.  I would give this place more stars if the dining experience on a peak night was better.  It's a small restaurant so it's tight in there.  What bothers me is that the waitresses don't seem to have a problem bumping into you, or rubbing their asses on your chair consistently throughout the night just to walk by.  I gave the startled look many times and they didn't give a crap.  Happened many times.  Just unacceptable. The place is good though."}
{"input": "Not as good as I expected. The chefs were Mexican??? We ended up spending over $40 for two ppl for lunch. The \"lunch deals\" don't fill you up! Waitress was nice."}
{"input": "This place sucks! The one up on oracle and wetmore is where I usually go, however, I moved and the university location is closer. Sorry Silver mine you have lost my business forever.\n\nFirst, I ordered two sandwiches a large homesteak  with no green onions. I accidentally typed onions instead of peppers that come on the sandwich. These bozos still proceed to put the greens on it and the manager laughs it off like no big deal. \nSecond, my hot homesteak sandwich was as cold as if had been sitting out for an hour. You guessed right it took an hour to get my food and then the hot sandwich was not wrapped in the proper wrapping to keep it warm.\nLastly, the employee got rude with me when I was checking to see what time my order would be done. He proceeded to scold me about how he only got it two minutes ago and it will be done when its done. Not how you talk to a customer buddy!\n\nGoodbye Silver mine!"}
{"input": "It was ok. Like another reviewer commented, you have to mention the happy hour menu and Taco Tuesday. Wasn't overly impressed. Everything that my friend and I had needed some seasoning...it was all very bland. Probably won't be back. I have to say that we like Mad Mex better."}
{"input": "When you walk in you go up to the counter to order, you are given a buzzer to let you know when you order is ready to go back up and get your food. After ordering you grab your cups and go get your drinks. Now your adventure begins, stroll out to the back of the property and you're greeted with an awesome ocean view. As others have said there is a great big sandbox with toys for kids to play but the best part is the great ocean view and atmosphere for the adults. We had the grilled fish & shrimp tacos. They were good - everything was very fresh.  Tacos come with a large side of fresh made tortilla chips & pico de gallo. Will definitely come back and try other items."}
{"input": "Excellent standard Mexican restaurant fare at reasonable prices. We had two entrees, an appetizer and a huge mug of beer each and the bill was just over $30. Nicely remodeled seating area, especially compared to the run-down look of the previous occupant, Hacienda."}
{"input": "Good food, great milkshakes!! Loved it! I will definitely be back next time I am in town!!"}
{"input": "Worst pizza ever- I am originally from NYC so I am aware that I have high standards when it comes to a good slice but I legit thought I was eating cardboard when I ordered a pizza from here. The only thing this place has going for them is their beer garden."}
{"input": "We came here on the holiday, July 4.  This place was great.  All the staff were so friendly and helpful.  My daughter had ear pain and the nurse we saw was very compassionate and patient with my daughter.  He tried to do his best to get the wax loose and out of her ear, but was unsuccessful after multiple attempts.  The doctor then came in to assist and immediately was able to remove a huge chunk of wax.  We were given prescriptions for antibiotics and went over to Target (in same shopping center) to get those filled.  The medication was cheaper at Target than what Med Express quoted us.   It was a great place for going to get immediate care while on vacation at the beach!  Thanks so much!"}
{"input": "Everybody loves Randy and he a man's sculptor with his vision.  Be prepared to wait when you walk in but he's worth it."}
{"input": "Seriously Ants Pants?  It's time to step up your game.  I've loved you for a long time but recently the quality and consistency seems to have slid downhill.  Today's chicken/red pepper/avocado sammy was an embarrassment. Smearing a rotten avocado all over my baguette?  Did you think I wouldn't notice?  Wilted lettuce for the salad?  FOR 9$?  \n\nAlso,when I order a bagel sandwich to-go, if you could do more than throw the thing in a paper bag (wrap it in foil?)  that would be great.  \n\nThe details count.  Don't make me break up with you for good!"}
{"input": "Great fish tacos and horchata! I'd recommend the combo 1. I've gone here many times throughout my time in Tucson, and this was definitely my favorite fish taco spot in Tucson (and possibly all of the USA I've visited so far). Shrimp tacos would be my second pick."}
{"input": "Poor lighting very dark can't even see your food all the food was average. Sorry I really wanted to like it more."}
{"input": "My crew and I come here on Wednesdays to Play Quizzo. The questions are somewhat easy and you aren't leaving like you are an idiot. I'm down for that.\n\nAs for the food and the service. Not a huge fan of the items on the menu, but I didn't come here nor expect to have a five course meal.  It is a bit overpriced, but its fine. I am not upset.\n\nThey do have happy hour drink and food specials.\n\nHuge fan of Smiths as a Sports Bar to watch a game or Happy Hour after work. Especially if you are a lawyer -- get on board, all your peers are here. Serious networking if you ask me.\n\nMinus a few stars because the food is not my favorite, but plus a few for their quizzo and kind staff."}
{"input": "Not as cool as the one in 12th South but it's hard to create something hip in the middle of not hip suburbia. Burger Up. Gets high marks for getting it close. Go sit at the bar. It's less hectic. Great cocktails ( bartenders are  amazing!). Fried pickles and the quinoa burger. Yum. Get there early. Remember it's Cool Springs. They roll up the carpets at 8:30. Or is it that everyone heads to Drakes?"}
{"input": "Don't let the building fool you. We stopped in for breakfast. The food is delicious and the waitresses are efficient and delightful."}
{"input": "Ok sometimes the hype  doesnt meet what is delivered, but I think Fed Donuts needs more hype.  Finally had  the chicken after several of their amazing donuts and all I can is wow. I had the buttermilk ranch it was amazing. Unlike any fried chicken that I have prior. I will make it a weekly spot from now on. \n\nGet there early things tend to sell out before 2pm."}
{"input": "I had been wanting to try this place for a while as it was really close to my internship. It's a cute, tiny spot that seems good for getting a few hours of work done or even just chilling. The crowd when I walked in was mixed, it included a man busy at his computer as well as a mom & her child enjoying breakfast. A couple others came in and out while I was ordering as well. \n\nI was really impressed with the beautifully crafted \"Lucky Goat\" latte I ordered...Dark chocolate, hazelnut, sea salt! It was delicious The barista was also patient and nice as I looked over what to order. I would definitely be back to try the other special drinks which all sounded amazing or try some of the fresh baked pastries. I'm also curious about the iced coffee.\n\nOne suggestion I'd have is for them to update their website! The website still lists fall specials and I know they have a couple of new drink specials every season! I'll be back soon to try more items off the menu!"}
{"input": "Kimpton Hotels are among my favorite hotels.\n\nThey are trendy and modern. The decor is beautiful. I love that they are pet friendly and don't charge extra fees. They have peanut butter flavored treats for your pet at check-in . They can also provide you with a loaner pet bed, water bowl, mat and even food if you forget. \n\nThe rooms are clean and airy. Each room comes with a free yoga mat and umbrella. You can also borrow a bike to ride around the city. \n\nThe staff are friendly and make sure you feel welcomed. A complimentary happy hour is hosted everyday from 5-6pm and free coffee and tea in the morning. \n\nLocated in Old City across from Independence Hall. \n\nThere are a lot of homeless in that area so definitely use caution. When we were walking a homeless man came charging towards us which was scary. He was definitely high and when we told him to stop and leave us alone he cursed at us and called us dirty B's. Luckily we were ok and we were able to continue walking."}
{"input": "Great food and great atmosphere!  I had the karee curry (sp?) - Tuesday special, and my colleague had the pad woonsen (glassy noodles).  Both were excellent!  So glad I tried a new Thai place over some of the other places I had been to regularly, in the past.  This place is quite small, so you probably want to get there relatively early or plan to wait.  We arrived about 1140a, or so.  The server also said the pad thai and the cashew chicken were the most popular dishes."}
{"input": "Holy Snicker-doodles I could spend a whole day in this place and not even be remotely finished looking around. I came in the other day to look for a costume for my niece and was pleasantly surprised at the selection of baby costumes in stock. Not only do they have costumes they have props out the wazoo, but anything you fancy to decorate your abode,car,body, etc."}
{"input": "This Mcdonalds has poor management. Went there once and they informed us they were out of straws. Another time The shake machine for st pattys shakes was down and they didn't know when it would be up. Went there 2 weeks later and it was still down. Went there once for take home and when we got home there was no hamburger in the buns. Just a bun with pickles, tomatoes, and lettuce. Finally I got the message that these people did not care about their customers and stop going there."}
{"input": "Truly a perfect arch. I love both Sol and his wife. They are perfectionists! We are working together to grow in a few hairs and I trust them completely that they let that process happen instead of making it thinner and thinner. They are awesome."}
{"input": "So I had a overall good meal but service was not very good and I ordered a New York strip with no mushrooms cause I'm allergic to mushrooms but they gave me them anyway I got mashed potatoes with gravy on the side but it came on top last but not least I ordered green beans and got broccoli but overall besides that it was a pretty good meal"}
{"input": "I go once a month for a women's haircut with Keri and, because Andre Richard is in my neighborhood, I usually schedule my appointments for weekday evenings. There is a nice sense of community at this salon. The atmosphere is always fun and inviting, with coffee or tea at the ready and many of the stylists singing along to the latest pop songs on the stereo. The salon is queer-friendly, and Keri does a wonderful job giving volume and style to short, thin hair. She is especially generous with tips on how to style my hair at home, offering blow-drying techniques and suggestions of inexpensive styling products available at CVS or Walgreens. My girlfriend received a great haircut there as well, and she has long, thick hair that falls in loose curls. I always feel welcome at Andre Richard and I leave feeling like my hair has been treated with care and attention. Plus, the salon sometimes offers specials on certain nights of the week (Thursday appointments are currently 20% during the month of February!)."}
{"input": "Totally worth the wait despite the heat!  I had the Vegan grits with a biscuit on the side. OMG!  So good. My 3 sisters each enjoyed their choices as well. Caution, the bloody Mary's are spicy!  The service was excellent. Really considering the wait was 45 mins, the line moved fast and then there was no long wait for our food. They have their process perfected!  Thanks Biscuit Love for a Delish breakfast!!!"}
{"input": "I made an appointment ahead of time for a gel manicure and basic pedicure. I assumed that a Sunday afternoon would be fairly crowded so when I arrived half an hour early I was surprised they were slow enough to take me ahead of my appointment. \n\nWhy they were slow, I do not understand because they did an absolutely phenomenal job! The technicians were friendly, the salon was clean and affordable. This place is the best I've been to in St. Louis and I can't believe if wasn't packed to capacity. \n\nHighly recommend!!"}
{"input": "Went for a casual happy hour and thoroughly enjoyed my $8 (normally $12) cocktail.\n$3.25 for a club soda.  Ouch.\n\nAlso loved the seared tuna appetizer with - get this - portabello \"fries\" - so tasty.\n\nExcellent food, service and one-of-a-kind atmosphere.\n\nPerfect for a date or romantic dinner for two.\nGreat for a proposal or special occaision.\nExpense-account-worthy.\n\nBoy can they throw down!\n\nN.B. - I can't get any cell phone service up here.  Oh well - with that view, who cares."}
{"input": "WOW!! What A burger, terrific flavor. Well cooked very well seasoned and a healthy portion of sides with it as well. We had homemade potato chips and waffle fries sweet potatoes.  \nThe outside patio was great, just wish there was a law against smoking ANYWHERE people could eat! \nOut waiter Jesse was jam up and took good care of us! \nThis place came on a recommendation from a friend and is off the beaten path just a bit but worth every single moment and delicious place and will return"}
{"input": "Tried the pizza this evening and was impressed, good sauce, toppings and nice crust. Good choice for pizza in Chalfont area, will definitely be back."}
{"input": "Good food. Non dependable delivery service which sucks in a town with scarce parking. For that reason I go elsewhere."}
{"input": "the employees were all nice and respectful to their customers. I rented out a two-people kayak for $30, and we were allowed to ride it for 3 hours, which is a pretty decent deal. I paddled the kayak around the port. it's a great place to kayak because there are areas where the waves are calm, and if you want, you can go out into the ocean and ride along the shores. I also saw seals just relaxing on a deck, which was a cool experience (wished i brought my phone to take pictures). Overall, it was a fun activity to do, especially during a warm sunny day :D"}
{"input": "Okay, first review, and I don't even live in Philly anymore. But now in Houston, I'm feeling the loss. \n\nI'd say there are two categories of doctorliness which make this a 5-star review. First, the impersonal stuff. Modern office, computerized charting, accurate scheduling (I was never kept waiting), the ability to make an appointment at short notice to get something looked at, convenient location. Can't think of anything that's lacking. She shares her office with another doctor who I haven't met.\n\nThe second category is the personal aspect. When I showed up the first time as a new patient, she spent a good deal of time with me and I got the feeling she cared about me as a person. Sweet. In all subsequent visits, that never changed. Without going into medical details, she herself called me when the results came in for some minor (and false) tests. \n\nAll in all, I can't imagine a better doctor. Why is it I found a badass doctor and a badass dentist in the one place I didn't live for any length of time?"}
{"input": "Everything you want to eat and drink is here.  The wine section is extensive.  A trip to the cheese room is heavenly.  The prepared foods are delicious.  The marinara sauce is to die for.  They have hoagies and paninis made to order. \n\nVisit the coffee bar for some serious brews.  The gelato looks and tastes very close to the real deal in Italy.  \n\nThey have a covered outside seating area that is cozy yet spacious.  You can even go grocery shopping here.  \n\nWhat is not to like about this place?  If you like Italian food you owe it to yourself to check this place out."}
{"input": "Today's experience has made me a lifelong valvoline customer if all employees operate the way these amazing mechanics do. Efficient. Fast. Friendly. Communicative. Oil changes aren't supposed to be awesome...just don't tell these workers that."}
{"input": "I have not been to PF Changs in about five years. But last time I was there it was great. This experience the other day was not so good. Food has gone downhill and the service was terrible. We had pad Thai and beef Szechuan and both were subpar. There are a lot better restaurants out there than this. I will not be going back."}
{"input": "The shrimp tacos and margaritas are reason enough to come.  I have a Local Taco next to my house (on Fatherland), but drive to this location because the cook is top notch.  The bartender explained that he tweaks some of the recipes, and it works!! Haven't had anything bad here.  The margarita mix is made in-house, and you can tell.  It is super fresh.  Don't even bother getting a top shelf margarita, the house is that good."}
{"input": "The Hollister of fast casual restaurants.  Plan on which burger joint you're going to afterwards because you're going to leave hungry.  For $5.99 I was assuming my juice would be more than 16 oz.  But the employees are very nice and visually nice to look at."}
{"input": "On a scale of one to things that are awesome, this place is the bomb. \n\nI was drawn in by the promise of the duckfat frenchfries. Took the boy for his birthday and put our name in, had a drink around the corner while we waited and were given seats at the bar after about 45 minutes. \n\nWe were waited on by Keith, the bartender, who was congenial, knowledgeable about his whiskeys and an all-around cool guy. We started with 3 cape may salts (two for me, one for the boy) and tater tots, both of which made me happy.\n\nFor dinner, I got Kentucky Fried Quail (stellar, though the succotash was not as exciting as I wanted it to be) and the boy got the 24$ Fois Gras burger, which was incredible. Worth every penny. The duckfat fries were pretty yummy, but not even the best part of the meal. I could've done without the cheese sauce, but as it was on the side I wasn't deterred.\n\nI look forward to coming back here, with everyone I know."}
{"input": "I was torn between 2 & 3 stars. First, based on my experience tonight, do not believe the photos. The amount of \"toppings\" , like beef, chicken , shrimp, etc. are overrated. My dinner, a combo of beef(2 small pieces, shrimp (3 small) and a very thin chicken fried spring roll) over vermicelli and lettuce was mostly lettuce and vermicelli. My appetizer of 2 shrimp and beef summer rolls were large but again, mostly filler material. I guess the Vietnamese diet is mostly vegetarian and if true, need to understand that before going. Should be priced accordingly though. You do get free hot tea but disappointing to find they had no ice tea on menu."}
{"input": "This is as close to Japanese cuisine I get! I'm not a big fan of sushi, sashimi or maki, but I really enjoy their rice bowls and tempura. This location is not terribly busy so you won't have to wait in line for too long. \n\nThey also provide catering options so you can have sushi and maki platters at your functions.\n\nThe service has always been good, for fast food. And I know I can keep somewhat on my eating plan when I go here. It's a fast lunch or dinner if you're in a hurry to."}
{"input": "You know what they say about sex or pizza; even when it's bad, it's good. 312 is not bad by any means! It just appears to be example of the growing trend of new restaurants in Nashville; price point does not match quality. This is based only on 2 experiences and is open to interpretation. \nWhat it does do well is provide great service. The staff were friendly, accommodating & seemed genuinely interested in \"serving\" you well. And this goes a long way in my book."}
{"input": "Basic donuts with strange names. Save your self the time and money and just to Snhuncks or better yet Worlds Fair donuts."}
{"input": "What a fun experience. Great tacos. Outdoor dining and no liquor license but the market next door has plenty of ice cold Modelo to go. They close at 5:00 so dinner may be a problem but for a delicious lunch you cannot ho wrong."}
{"input": "Emerald is a fantastic dive bar with a long history. It's the neighborhood St. Pete bar and all demographics venture into this place."}
{"input": "Was taken here today by a Colombian friend who needed to satisfy a craving for something cheap and delicious. This place reminds me of Nanzhou, a Yelp favorite, because of the heaping helpings you get for next to nothing. \n\nI got the oxtail soup (Sancocho) with extra rice and plantains to see how it would differ from the Korean-style stuff I was used to at home. Aside from a thicker, stew-like broth and beefier potatoes, it was just as delicious. My friend got a flat steak (Carne Asada) that I think he ate in just under 10 seconds. \n\nRemember Yelp, you're missing out on a lot if you don't visit NE philly once in a while, especially this place."}
{"input": "Food was delish and tasty, but more importantly - service was superb! We asked if the restaurant served wine, and they told us it was BYOB. So a few minutes after sitting down, hubby and I got dressed to go out and get smthg in nearby bar - that's when owner told us he found a bottle of wine and gave it to us on the house! That was so nice, genuine and thoughtful! Excellent, cozy, yummy place for lunch, with warm hospitality -highly recommend!"}
{"input": "Awesome hotel! This place is 2 easy blocks from Bourbon st. It's in an old early 1900's building which gives the room a cool look with brick seen from the outside walls. The room was very clean and sleek. With the nasty of Bourbon st each night it was a great escape! Will stay here if I ever come visit again!"}
{"input": "These guys are awesome! Best burger restaurant in New Orleans. Service was on point, they made sure we had our food in a timely manner and food is fresh. We flew in from Atlanta, And this is the first place we went to. And we will definitely be back before we leave. \n\nMy friends ordered the Gator burger and the deer burger. I personally ordered the buffalo wings, which was very good. We left super happy! Btw they're drinks are very good too!"}
{"input": "The pizza was the best we've had in the Fairmount/Art Museum/Brewerytown area and we've probably tried 5 or so.  The pepperoni was a little crispy (good thing) and the wings were, too.  That last one is really surprising since there are so many soggy wings out there.  Lazos does it right.  They gave me Sprite instead of Coke but otherwise this was a very good pizza+wing combo.  Will order again!"}
{"input": "This is just some seriously authentic Mexican food.\n\nI found out about this place from my boss who was raving about the horchata. They make it fresh. It's the kind of horchata that you have to keep stirring to keep it together. Definitely the best I've ever had.\n\nThe tacos are so well made. The meat is very tender and all the pickled veggies with fresh corn tortillas make for a wonderful, tasty combination.\n\nYou basically feel as though you are in Mexico here. From the outside to the inside it is very authentic. I didn't try the pico but it seems very unique."}
{"input": "Not bad. Came here with a larger group of people for dinner and the service was good and the food fairly tasty. \n\nThe margaritas for happy hour aren't super strong, but they're cheap.\n\nI had a steak burrito and thought it was a bit pricy for its size and quality. That said, it wasn't bad. I'd come back again, but I'd try and get the daily special."}
{"input": "Awesome food and service!!!  Authentic Chicago Vienna beef hot dog...all the way down to that bright green relish. I will definitely be back!"}
{"input": "From the moment you step into the cake bake shop you can tells its unlike any other bakery in Indy. Its decorations are very frilly and ornate in the most adorable sense! The cases are lined with treats that are as wonderful to look at as they are to eat. I got two eclairs and two cookies; after the friendly cashier rang up my total I was a bit taken back. This is definitely a special occasion/bad day kind of bakery. The treats are obviously made with a large amount of attention to detail but this place is definitely not pocketbook friendly!\n\n\n\nWent to the Cake Bake Shop again today for a piece of coconut cream pie. Paid $9.80 for one piece of pie. I think the owner should reevaluate the amount of embellishments (gift bags, fancy napkins,pink forks) and the amount of staff members standing around to lower the costs. The pie was just ok.\n\n\nEverything is covered in glitter now...not sure how I feel about this."}
{"input": "This is an awesome addition to the dessert options in Nashville! I love ice cream in a cone, but this absolutely knocks that out of the park (pun intended being next to Centennial Park)\n\nService: The person working was a sweet older lady that was very patient, and even let us try several flavors which was nice. \n\nFood: I had the Monster (blue dough with M&Ms and peanut butter chips) and the Red Velvet in a French vanilla cone with caramel. Talk about treating yourself....so rich, delicious, and heavy if im honest. Next time I will have to split two scoops in a cone as the portions are outrageously large (not a bad thing)\n\nOverall, this place is a huge treat for your significant other or your kids. I highly recommend trying NoBaked at least once!"}
{"input": "Just a fantastic dining experience. The food was so good. I had the shrimp and grits, my mother had the salmon. Both were excellent. The one thing that was truly amazing was the Tanked fish tank. Its an entire wall filled with gulf fish. I will def be coming back here."}
{"input": "By far superseded all of my expectations I would pass by this place all the time thinking it was just your typical run of the mill PIZZA SHOP until I tried the food and boy was I sadly mistaken I was actually pissed off at my self for not going there sooner! The food is incredible made fresh to order there are NO microwaves in this hip joint ! The pizza is off the wall the Italians wouldn't believe what these guys can do with a little dough I highly recommend the buffalo chicken pizza it will blow your socks right off ! The atmosphere is perfect.  A bunch of hungry college kids looking for some good food and the prices are just right. Oh one more thing the chicken soup is a real winner I still haven't been able to reproduce it , this soups is prepared fresh daily with super chunks of breasts of chicken so don't be shy use the scoop it straight  from the bottom and serve it up hot!"}
{"input": "This place was so chill and relaxing. When I come back it'll definitely be in my list if stops. Not to mention the artist performing was fun and eclectic  (I mean really, a country version of \"Let It Go\", what's not to love?)"}
{"input": "My go to place for fried seafood here in Nashville!  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the fried oysters and clam strips basket!  The seafood is always fresh and tasty!  On days when I'm \"trying\" to be good, I flip the menu over to their sushi offerings...the Green Goddess and the Shrimp Pad Thai are my faves!"}
{"input": "best place ever! ice cream and ambience were hands down, way fun! go on saturday night to hear band!"}
{"input": "There never seems to be a crowd at this Marsh store...getting in and out is always easy.  I agree with the other reviewer on the state of red baskets...ick.  Fix please!\n\nI like that they opened up aisles so you don't have to walk all the way to one end to go to the next (prob happened a long time ago but I just noticed today).  And always seems like they are one cashier short here.\n\nVery good selection of products (as always) from Marsh."}
{"input": "Great restaurant, and creative menu. We also love La Mulita next door, which shares the same kitchen. The only downside is that they do not take reservations, so it can be a bit of a gamble on a weekend. You also need your whole party to sit, so if you have a late friend, you could be stuck for a bit."}
{"input": "Fantastic Mexican truck. \n\nThe guys there are very kind and polite.\n\nThe tacos are superb.  Tostado was delicious.  Veggies seem very fresh and clean.  \n\nOnly outdoor seating.  Ice cold can/bottle drinks and shade."}
{"input": "So I've been craving BBQ and I never knew this place really existed so we tried it, for my overall experience the service was quick, I had the brisket & my family had the pulled pork which was all good, I had potato casserole which was awesome but I did have green beans & they were not good at all. Other than that, everything is great!"}
{"input": "This salon was lovely! Very nice staff, clean environment though it definitely smelled like a nail salon, and really reasonable prices.\n\nI get terrible migraines and I was worried that I would get one because it does smell like other mail salons, but it must have been more well ventilated than I thought, because I didn't even get a headache.\n\nI went with the deluxe pedi, which was 100% worth it."}
{"input": "Great food and service. The antipasto was by far the best that I have ever had.  The pasta is all fresh and full of flavor. The Fisherman's stew was loaded with great tender fish in a saffron sauce."}
{"input": "This is one of the best affordable and yummy brunch places in University City. If you want a very traditional American brunch, this is the place to go! It has a warm and comfortable atmosphere that reminds you of home or of the family diners you might find back in your suburban hometown. Number 10 or 9 is my go to for this place."}
{"input": "Free sake mon-thurs, good value. Go here all the time for birthdays, quick service and friendly staff. They also have a stamp card deal for a free meal."}
{"input": "Great luxury institution of Nashville. The wait can be long, but the atmosphere and vibe of the place is worth it. We got the potato pancakes and eggs, which were good as well as omelette. Apple sauce also came with it. Cooking here isn't fancy and reminds me of more of home cooking but great nonetheless."}
{"input": "Haven't tried the restaurant but the bakery I can assure you is as As Greek as Greek can be. From traditional pastries to pastries with a twist you will not be disappointed. Always fresh always good.  Service with a smile. \n\nLively Greek music encourages you to not only   sing along but dance too."}
{"input": "Had lunch at Ulele this afternoon and decided to take advantage of the Coast Bike Share located right outside to cruise down the Riverwalk. The weather was perfect today so we figured it was a good time to enjoy a cruise along the river! The bikes were plentiful at the location that we picked them up from but we later found none to be retrieved near Sail Pavilion later in the day! You need to download the app and make sure to press the buttons very hard on the keypad, otherwise they won't register your account number. Another warning: these bikes are very heavy so if you plan to go up any stairs, you'd better be strong (learned the hard way!). While the charge is $8 per hour, it is prorated so you will only be charged for the time that your bike is used. I'm glad we have this resource available in Tampa and I will definitely use again!"}

{"input": "Open-lands along the Mississippi River with wonderful city views. The park itself is a bit meandering with its odd stop-and-start spongy walkways and doesn't offer an abundance of things to do but a riverfront park what more can you ask for. Nice place to run, stroll or relax. Much less traveled than the nearby riverwalk ...a nice riverfront retreat. To enter the park you can use an elevator or one of the rusty rainbow bridges within the Marigny or flat access on the Bywater entrance (if biking easier way to enter). The Bywater entrance has parking and next to a small dog park. The park also includes a few port-a-pottys mixed in various areas and permanent bathrooms at the start of the Marigny entrance. Escape the crowds and experience the local view of the city."}
{"input": "For the time and effort I put into ordering online 30 minutes before my pickup, I was pretty disappointed to skip the long line only to be told they 'didn't have anything' in their system. Thanks for nothing."}
{"input": "I had a 3 hour lay over and growing up in Philly made me excited to see a restaurant with cheesesteaks.  Every addition  (onions) was an upcharge the sandwich was decent size...fair taste. Definitely not the hype the video board showed but it was the airport! A better option than subway but if you spend any time in my hometown there are far better sandwiches out there."}
{"input": "This place doesn't want your business!! Try to call in a take-out order and they'll ignore the phone, direct you to their app (they've actually refused to take my order over the phone) or require a credit card to place an order. Going there is no picnic either. Your clothes will smell like you worked the kitchen. Bring headphones if you do go because there's no music and the noise is deafening. Constant noise from the fry cutting machine and sirens going off when fries are done. The burgers taste OK but the fries are greasy and undercooked. Expect diarrhea. I tried to give zero stars but Yelp doesn't allow that!"}
{"input": "This place ROCKS! The people were nice, the food great. Lots of food for the price also. I will be back.... Soon."}
{"input": "I had just moved to Nashville and one of my friends told me I HAD to come here. We're not both from here originally so technically we were still tourists at this point. Anyways, I went around 9:15 and the line wasn't too bad - I'd say a 5-10 minute wait. The food was awesome. I had the chocolate chip pancakes which were to die for. The sausage side I had didn't rock my world then again it's not the Side Dish Pantry. You don't pay at the table - they ring you up by the door to try and get people in and out fast which seems to work because the line is always moving fairly fast. \n\n\nRip : I drive by it almost every morning - if you want to avoid the line go either RIGHT when they open to around 7:15"}
{"input": "So glad to find this place! The food is simply delicious! Apple salad is the bomb! Honestly, I tried almost everything on the menu and was not disappointed once. Except for the one time when I tried to order lunch and, they could not place my order because they were extremely busy. Which is NOT a bad thing - the food is just this good!"}
{"input": "As expected, the donuts were AMAZING. My husband LOVED them. The options were plentiful. Check this place out! Yummy!"}
{"input": "Found there to be a good variety of food for a late night dinner with young kids. Wish we had one this good near us in upper PA. Person that rang us in was friendly and helpful. Two things  made our experience top notch. First was out waiter Eric, who was friendly, observant, went out of his way to get odd requests, and quick to getting back to us.  Eric is the type of waiter you would find a quality sit down restaurant.  The other were the 2 people at the grill house station. When I asked to have shrimp not basted due to a pepper allergy that offered to get different tings to remove them from the grill. I appreciated their thoughtfulness."}
{"input": "A great lunch or dinner stop in Reno, NV.  \n\nWe've had some fine meals in this establishment......Tyler (manager) does a great job with his staff, and it shows in the overall results.\n\nThey are also a pub, so its got a great selection of beers and wines too!"}
{"input": "Fantastic grilled oysters to start. Muffeletta was good. White chocolate bread pudding was amazing.  Service was very good.  I disliked my blackberry basil margarita, it was not good at all. I told the staff, but they didn't take it away or off the tab :("}
{"input": "I do want to update readers to say I was personally contacted by the parts/service manager at Toyota of SB  same day I wrote my review. The manager agreed to look at the disparity in costs compared to other dealerships for Key replacement service and was willing to match costs.  In the interest of full disclosure, I wanted Yelp readers to be aware of their willingness to address my complaint. Am I happy to pay $300 instead of $590 for a $10 key .. eh.. no... but they did pick up the phone and called me."}
{"input": "Try the 007 roll... It's amazing! All of the House Specialty Rolls are good. Quaint, quiet and delicious! Temaki is talicious!"}
{"input": "My dad and I just happened upon this place one Saturday night and decided to give it a go. \n\nYou have to knock on the door to be let in, and the inside is gorgeous. Dimly lit, the walls are lined with tapestries. You sit on cushions, and eat an entire seven course meal with your hands (after they have been washed in rose water). Great food and the house wine is really good (and inexpensive). You almost feel as if you were invited into someone's home. A belly dancer even came out in the middle of our meal! \n\nWe went pretty early on a Saturday night, so the fact that we didn't have a reservation wasn't a problem. We went about 5-5:30 and it was completely empty, but it started to really fill up around 7, so if you are going later make a reservation.\n\nThe only problem we ran into is that they don't take credit cards. Luckily they do take checks. This place has it all - atmosphere, great food, and good service! Big points for overall experience!"}
{"input": "This was our first experience eating lunch at Cheddar's. Our server was Joey.  We really appreciated that our food was made after we ordered it, rather than being prepared hours before.  Joey brought us coffee and--my test of an attentive server--keep our coffee and water filled up.  When we were low on coffee, instead of warming up our coffee, he brought new cups.  This was typical of the excellent service.\n     The food was superb.  I had a medium-rare steak; it was actually cooked medium-rare, which does not always happen.  The flavor of all our entrees and side orders was very tasty.\n     We plan to go back frequently.  Heartily recommended.  The wait is noted in other reviews, and it's because of the quality of food.  If you want to avoid a line, go to a fast food place."}
{"input": "For me it was easy and fast to order on my way to go.. delicious and best lamb biryani I ever had"}
{"input": "Nice boutique yoga space.  Fairly clean.  The class had a nice flow however as a first timer and being new to the studio I find it bothersome that the teacher didn't correct me, adjust me, or assist me with any of my poses.  She didn't make any type of contact or connection with me the whole time.  She payed more attention to the experienced yogis.  Most likely not the studio for you if you are either a beginner or simply want assistance every now and then."}
{"input": "Close to where I live. It's very loud place and the cashier couldn't hear my order properly had to make another transaction. When we sat down it it was hard to hear ourselves. Overall the ginger beef was great. I gotta go another day to try other items in the menu."}
{"input": "Our favorite little taco place! We always get the steak, chicken, and fish tacos. We looove the queso! Highly recommend."}
{"input": "I didn't find the prices here that inexpensive.  I waited in line for a long time to get a key copied.  It was the same line as the returns, so you can imagine how long the wait was.  Only to find out that they don't copy auto keys.  \n\nBought two pairs of shoes.  Looked very closely at the sale signs.  Seemed very clear that it was a buy one, get one at half off.  Got to the cash register and the register rang up the shoes as one was for sale at $5 off and no get one half off.  No way.  Absolutely no signage to that effect.  \n\nWhat a mess.  At least the dude at the cash register was cool."}
{"input": "Love this shop - Zeagle loves it too.   Great selection and the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.  Always answers all our questions!"}
{"input": "Gene from Chim Chimney is the man! Great customer service, excellent dustless process and an unmatched care for the customer. Gene noticed some separation in the sealer and mortar on the second story of my house while he was climbing up to inspect the chimney topper, in a place I could never have seen, but he took a picture and brought it to me so to assure that I did not experience a leak. Wow! Above and beyond the call. \n\nOh yes...Chim Chimney is the cheapest price in town too."}
{"input": "The ramen is okay, nothing spectacular. Service is okay. Good place for a quick stop but wouldn't go if there were other choices. Been here twice, will continue to go."}
{"input": "I love this place. Been coming here for almost 20 years. If you want good boiled or fried seafood in an extremely casual no frills atmosphere, this place is a safe bet. The raw oysters here are always very fresh and reasonably priced. The service is good if a bit rushed at times (the place is small and gets VERY busy). Not the place to go to impress a first date or before a night at the theatre, but perfect before enjoying a night out at Mardi Gras or after a long day of Jazzfest."}
{"input": "Easily my favorite hotel in Philadelphia.  Well located in Center City and the rooms are exquisitely designed.  Several times while staying here with my girlfriend, we've had the pleasure of dealing with a housekeeper named Sam.  His service has been absolutely outstanding every time and he has helped make our visits here even more enjoyable.  Already looking forward to the next weekend at Hotel Monaco."}
{"input": "3.5 stars total. \n\nIf you're used to Philly brunch this is not going to be entirely comparable.  However,  other than diners this is a great breakfast choice in the area. \n\nYou may need to wait 10-15 minutes for a table on Saturday and Sunday.  There is outdoor seating available for when the weather is nice. \n\nThe coffee menu is amazing.  This is the only restaurant that I know of (other than coffee houses) that brings a French press to your table.  Variety of beans including Costa Rican,  Hawaiian,  and Jamaican.  Gourmet iced coffee with coffee iced cubes- hell yes! Plus refills free to go. \n\nThe menu is simple focusing on eggs, hot cakes,  and sandwiches.  Nothing has totally blown me away but the food is good and fresh. Random sidenote obsessed with the red pepper soup.\n\nDefinitely one of my to go to breakfast spots in south Jersey - recommend."}
{"input": "Absolutely fantastic food! The chicken tikka masala, chicken 65, and the garlic chicken are all absolutely incredible, as well as the saar and garlic naan. Nice place. Very well-lit and clean. This is officially our new favorite place to eat in Mt. Juliet!"}
{"input": "Love the yum yum club and macaroni salad is awesome too!! Sometimes service could be a little more friendly but besides that I continue to go back because price is right and good tastes great"}
{"input": "Everything was exceptional from the time I arrived. I was greeted with a friendly smile, and the quality of the service provided by technician Rickie McCoy was phenomenal. He paid attention to every detail and when he was done, I was 100% satisfied. He even cleaned all of my car windows, even though he was only fixing a small chip in the windshield. He went over all the aspects of the repair and let me know all of the do's and don'ts for care in the first few hours to preserve the quality of the repair."}
{"input": "I love just going and walking around the store. It's got to be my favorite store ever! And the prices are not inflated like you would expect a big store like this to be. I feel comfortable with every purchase I make that I am not getting ripped off...\nStaff is always friendly and helpful. This past winter I was looking for a tree stand and one employee explained all his experience and gave me his best opinion on which one I should get, and I'm glad I got it. Without him Explaining it all to me I was lost and I would've purchased the wrong thing."}
{"input": "Excellent food! We can be picky about Indian food but this place is a favorite. Generous portions(except for the Naan) but enough food for leftovers.  The rice is great and the curry spices can be ordered to suit your palate.  We get delivery and we are never disappointed."}
{"input": "First off. let me say I have not eaten at this restaurant.  I went in to simply pick up a menu so that I could order from home and go pick up my meal.  \n\nUpon walking into the restaurant, I stood by the counter/register and waited for someone to come to the front.  A woman walked up from the back of the place and said, \"ya\".  I asked for a to-go menu, received one and left.  I perused the menu in the car and noticed they seen to be priced higher than many other Indian places in the Nashville area.  \n\nSorry, but \"ya\" is not how I prefer to be greeted.  Like I said, I have not eaten at this restaurant.  After this brief encounter, I will not do so.\n\nAlso, I find it very interesting that the most recent positive reviews of this restaurant are from folks with Indian names who live in other states."}
{"input": "Located right at the Union Station Metro stop (walking distance to all of downtown but metro-able too), this place was a good deal on the weekend.  Prices spike during the week when business-peeps fly in and their companies are paying the bill.  The room was clean, the bed was super comfy with TONS of pillows (one sure way to my heart).  The bathroom was large with a tub and too many white towels for two people.  Subtracted one star cause the coffee machine in our room sucked and the door was thin so you could hear people/children in the hall at WAY too early in the morning.  The main lobby is really a cool place tho.  Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"input": "I came here the other day and the person that guides you into the car wash was rushing me. It's not like there was fifty cars behind me. Free vacuum cool."}
{"input": "I am surprised the average rating is 3.5 stars. For what it is, a soccer bar, I think this place is great and I actually prefer this location to the Mass Ave one.\n\nThe decor makes you feel like you're at an English pub. There are TVs everywhere so it's a great place to watch a game.\n\nThe beer selection is great, the service is great and the food is good. I've had their chicken salad sandwich, wings and fish and chips and all three are good. Better than your typical bar food."}
{"input": "Good place for home cooked meal. Great prices. Can get breakfast any time. Better choice than fast food. Sometimes the wait is long but not on this visit. \n\nThe only consistent disappointment is the corn bread & biscuits. I've heard others rave about them but I think they are tasteless. Cracker Barrel has done a good job of adding lower calorie choices that are quite delicious and satisfying. \n\nThey should spend time improving the cornbread and biscuits. \n\nThis visit I ordered the BBQ chicken topped with diced apples. Yum! My son got buttermilk oven fried chicken and said it was as good as deep fried. My daughter, grilled chicken tenders, her favorite. My hubby ordered grilled chicken salad and said it was wonderful. \n\nWe ended our visit with a walk through the gift shop. Always great fun! Filled with a unique selection of items that you just can't find anywhere else. Bonus: contemporary Christian mixed with country music playing throughout."}
{"input": "Tried this place out after many suggestions from friends.  We went in one night about an hour or so before closing just to find that they were only serving a partial menu - we're not talking that late, it was like, 9:30 on a weekend.  There was no mention of going down to a bar menu on the website so I was a bit annoyed by that.  Something about 'surprise disappointments that could be totally avoided' really bother me.  So, the dish I had picked out online wasn't available and I ordered a burger instead.  The server seemed to have a very hard time understanding my burger and suggested that modifications couldn't be made?  I told him I'm sure removing a single topping wouldn't cause the kitchen staff any issues...  The rest of the meal we were generally ignored and the service wasn't great.  I found the food to be overpriced for the quality.  Unless there is a special reason to attend, I don't think we'll be going back."}
{"input": "This place is a true gem. I had a carrot and ginger soup with the turkey and cranberry sandwich. Both were delicious (my husband won't stop talking about it)! Plus we got to meet Sabrina herself who made us feel like old friends. Highly recommend."}

{"input": "I purchased the yelp deal for $155.  What a great deal.  I called and scheduled a time for the much needed help.  My very first phone interaction was with Cory.  He asked a few general questions then asked me what day I needed help on.  He then followed up with a confirmation call the day before my move and again a hour before he was scheduled to begin.  He arrived at the scheduled time with a partner \"Deron\".  They treated my items as if they were they're own.  They were professional, friendly, and FAST.  I will use this company again."}
{"input": "Food and service were great. Ask for Jaclyn Smith. She's a new server and is incredible.  So very attentive and polite.  I promise, it's worth getting Ms. Smith (soon to be Smith, she's engaged i don't know her current last name). The coffee tenderloin is absolutely the best steak I've had and I travel and eat out a lot, it's incredible."}
{"input": "I am from New York, Alfredo has a spectacular cheesesteak he is very nice I added hot peppers and tomatoes and grilled onions delicious and great price! Extremely friendly and delicious the pizza is also very good. My go to place"}
{"input": "The food is very good but the ability to turnover the tables is a huge problem on busy days. Waited over an hour to be seated today and about an hour to get food. I just do not have 2 hours available to get breakfast. They do not have the proper staffing to quickly get the food out and clear tables in a timely fashion. There were many upset people there due to the time to wait. While we were eating there were 2 empty tables for at least 15 minutes that they did not seat anyone at yet when we left there was a longer line than when I arrived which we waited an hour to be seated. The workers were trying but were simply overwhelmed. Management needs to do a better job handling the staffing schedules. I will not be coming back due to this experience."}
{"input": "Had a panini and a chocolate chip cookie from this place for a quick lunch on a trip to nashville. Was very impressed with the quality of the bread and the cookie. The sandwich overall was just a fine, standard panini but I did enjoy the seeds present in the bread and I'd like to go back and try something else next time."}
{"input": "It's okay. There are definitely better sushi places in the area so better than going here. They always have the Groupon going on maybe some other specials but the quality is not where I prefer"}
{"input": "Someone is \"salting\" this place ... what I mean is, if you are giving this joint even the sightest positive nod you are either a family member of the owner or you have been living in the Sudan for the last ten years (no offense to the Sudanese but if you have been there.. ) This restaurant was good years ago .. NOW = Old food that does not get replentished unless you beg (where the F is the board of health?) My wife goes for the Crab Legs (ALL YOU CAN EAT MY EYE) .. they actually have the nerve to post a hand written sign taped over the very small cab leg pan that reads \"please take only 3 or 4 legs ..be considerate to others\" What it should read is  \"Please take only 3 or 4 crab legs because we want to capture more of your money by not having to repentish the crab legs\" .... the propieters are very nice, but their actions are not appropriate .. Perhaps they should just close down and do something else .. or do something right."}
{"input": "Easy to get to when you get you luggage, but it is a bit of a challenge if  you have not been there before when  you return your car.  If you show up later at night there are very few options for vehicles.  If you are an Emerald Club member then getting your car is easy and if you use their app it is even easier at the checkout."}
{"input": "Huge portions at a great price.. Huge menu so everyone can order. Wonderful place. We love Polly's."}
{"input": "Mary Brown's tries to be KFC but lets face it.. no chicken place can compare toe greatness of the chicken, gravy, fries or burgers at KFC.\n\nI found their chicken to be dry and a bit tasteless. The gravy wasn't great either. In all honesty, this place didn't really have a chance because from the moment I stepped in I was comparing it to KFC in every aspect and I love KFC when it comes to things chicken related. \n\nOverall everything here is just sub par. Nothing to write home about and nothing to even recommend."}
{"input": "The service was great and the restaurant was clean, but the food was just okay. We had the linguine with marinara and the rotini primavera. The linguine was fine. The primavera, however, is not something anyone should order!!! The sauce had a great flavor, but the vegetables were actually from frozen. I mean, literally from FROZEN. Go to your local grocery store, look at the bag of Bird's Eye mixed vegetables and you will see what they use... right down to the ruffle cut carrots. There is so much wonderful fresh produce in Tucson, there is absolutely no reason to ever use gross frozen vegetables."}
{"input": "This Starbucks always makes drinks correctly and the drive thru is fast... Even on busy mornings."}
{"input": "Excellent place to get a tattoo. I have had two done at B13 and am really pleased with both. One was with a group of people and the owner was able to fit all 4 of us in with a great sketch on really short notice. If you aren't sure who to go to, I've seen especially awesome work by Amanda, though everyone is great I'm sure."}
{"input": "Delicious! Best place around for ice cream . Everything is made fresh from cows without hormones and antibiotics . It's cash only, but it's worth the trip to the ATM."}
{"input": "I love zaxbys but this location needs a lot of work. I saw an employee struggling to get in due to being late, and once I pulled up to the drive thru, I waited more than 5 minutes to be answered. And I waited another 5-7 minutes for my food. It was a little bit ridiculous and not at all worth it."}
{"input": "This place was unreal. The chips and queso were so warm and delicious. The burrito I got with fried shrimp and cauliflower in it sounds weird but it was incredible. The food was so flavorful and such a good mix of tastes. The churros were to die for. The staff were all super friendly and nice. If you are looking for some amazing Mexican food go here!!"}
{"input": "Food was generally pretty good but not my preference.\n\nSea Bass Ceviche - was well done but did not blow my socks off.  \nPlatter - pork was really moist and tasty.  Chicken was on the dry side, obviously slightly overcooked.  But for a rotisserie restaurant, you should be on point with any meat that goes on.\nTamales - very tasty, more classic Mexican, more towards the type of Mexican food I prefer\nMeatballs - they were ok.  Tasted like a meatball from a different country.  Not overly dry but not melt in your mouth either.\n\nAtmosphere - casual\nFood - not my type of Mexican.  For me average\nWine - mostly South American which makes great wines.\n\nAnything rated ( fro my rating ) 4 stars and up, I would make an effort to be back.  Read it how you may."}
{"input": "The bar in this place is amazing! Very cool location with an outstanding wait staff.. the food is amazing. We have been here several times and have always left full. We are constantly impressed with their wine selection as well, it stays current with many great vineyards on their list.\n\nHowever good, our feedback is that they are limits on space and are not set up well for parties larger than 8. We were able to squeeze 10 into their largest table, but were challenged for space throughout the dinner.\n\nOverall a great experience, will return, just with a smaller group."}
{"input": "That horrible angst - you want sushi, but you're not SO hungry that you can do AYCE or want to spend $25 for lunch. So we popped in on a weekend for a late lunch and decided to order a la carte.  I ordered a long roll and a hand roll, a drink and a chocolate mochi (OMG, I am officially in love with these things) and the total cost came to just under $20 with tip.  It filled my belly enough so that I was satisfied.  Had I gone for just one more roll, I probably would have broke even with the AYCE, but I probably would've been so stuffed to the point where I wouldn't have needed to eat anything else all day - not the plan for this particular day.\n\nThe rolls tasted fresh and delicious, but the surprise was definitely the mochi - so creamy and tasty."}
{"input": "The staff is really friendly and the facility is mostly clean but all the equipment is extremely outdated. I like a hardcore gym, I love a hardcore gym, but this one was too archaic for me to enjoy or to get a good workout. The staff was really nice and really friendly.. so I don't like to say anything bad about the gym, but I have to be honest about the facility."}
{"input": "I was fortunate to come across this lovely place! As a sushi lover, I've always been apprehensive about sushi burritos because it sounds like too much rice and not enough variety. I was very wrong. The sushi burrito is perfection. It is the perfect lunch because it's fresh and light. The serving size is plentiful and the ingredients are very fresh. \n\nIt is set up like a chipotle and you pick what ingredients you would like. I would recommend adding a topping with some crunch like wonton crisps because it really adds to the overall texture. The tuna is definitely my favorite! Overall, it's an awesome lunch spot. Highly recommend."}
{"input": "The best chocolate croissant (petit pain au chocolat) I had in USA!  I like the atmosphere, very industrial look. The place is shared with a wine bar, so you can have an excellent sandwich made with a French baguette and a glass of wine. It was too early for me. I would recommend this place."}
{"input": "I like donuts. Hot,fresh,now at Krispy Kreme used to be my Mecca of donuts. Now that I have tried Federal's donuts, I have vowed that no other donut is worthy of the calories.  A plus is that the folks are nice and the location makes it feel \"real.\""}
{"input": "was visiting Media & went with my besties for pedis.  they do a great job-- salt scrub & hot stone leg/foot massage is included in the $25 pedi.  good selection of colors, they have those big crazy massage chairs & a bright, clean space.  all the ladies that worked there were friendly."}
{"input": "We tried this place while we were in town and really liked all the food. We ordered the burger and wings. You can't go wrong eating here! The staff was very nice and helpful with the menu!"}
{"input": "I went here with five friends after dinner on my birthday.  Initially, there were no tables or seats available, but after looking at the extensive cocktail menu, we decided to stay for at least a drink even if we had to stand.  While we were choosing drinks, two separate servers came by to tell us there would be a table available soon and that they'd get it cleared right away.  \n\nThe pumpkin pie martini was on special.  One of my friends ordered it and several others tried it and they all agreed that it was delicious. First, I had the ultimate chocolate martini, which was superb.  The rim was chocolate--almost like magic shell before it hardens.  I followed it up with an Almond Joy martini.  It was also fantastic.  It had a perfect coconut/chocolate balance, and a whipped cream rim.  I'm guessing they were about 400 calories each, but so worth it. \n\nThe staff were super nice, and the drinks were scrumptious.  I would definitely go here again for fancy cocktails."}
{"input": "It's just a place to get my mail. \nIt's about $250.00 per year for a little box.  it makes sense for us because we travel so much.  I don't want any important mail being delivered to my house.  \nI have a door key to the store so I can access my letter box after hours.\nMy larger parcels are kept in the back.  I get a phone call every time I receive one.  \nI would rather ship out my parcels using Fed-ex because they are cheaper and more reliable.   \nMy husband has used their printing services and is happy with them. \nI see packaging materials and other stationary goods for sale, but I prefer to use Canada Post for that.\nNo problem with the staff.  They are cheerful and helpful.  They know me well.\nThe strip mall location can be a little sketchy.  Some druggies and homeless people like to hang out at the neighbouring store fronts."}

{"input": "We love Holiday house! My four legged fur baby has been to at least 4 or 5 boarding places due to us moving several times over the last few years. We can always tell when she's comfortable at the facility because she will go right back without a problem which is definitely what she does at Holiday house! She always comes home tired and freshly clean with a beautiful coat. In addition, which tops off this review, is the fact that I had to board my sweet girl in a rush due to being in early labor with my daughter. I called Holiday House that after noon, they not only had a room for her but they offered to have someone come pick her up for me at my home so that I didn't have to drive her. That, to me, is quality service! I only wish they had cameras so that I could see her while we are away."}
{"input": "We tried Izumi last night after reading the great reviews from here. It was a great eating experience. The place was small but had a comfotable feel and the waiter was great. He explained everything in an upbeat fashion and his recommendations were stellar. \n\nWe got various sushi dishes such as the Rainbow Roll, Passyunk Roll, Spicy Tuna and California Roll. Which was the best Sushi I had in the city to this point. We will be returning soon to try different offerings."}

{"input": "Ordered the Korean tacos made from naa bread and meat was very cheap. More than half the meat was fat. Also very little meat overall. Unfortunately did not like my experience."}
{"input": "Great food with affordable price. Homemade feeling. Had the seafood basket and it was great."}

She is highly organized, efficient, and\ncaring, making your bagel just the way you like it.   Move over, NYC - best bagels on the East Coast are now right here in Royersford.  Go, Shiela! Bravo, Barrister's!"}
{"input": "I recently had dinner here with my wife over the weekend and could not have been more pleased! \n\nOur meal was excellent! My wife and I were astounded by how quickly our food came out! Everything tasted fresh and homemade which we both appreciated. \n\nThe only problem was trying to pick something from the menu as there were too many delicious sounding items to choose from. We will definitely be returning to try more items! Can't wait to see what the next chef specials will be!"}
{"input": "New owners turned it into a double threat: Bad food AND bad service. Shame. I loved this place."}
{"input": "I enjoyed my lunch at Luke's. The service was superb and the food was delicious. We could taste the love and thought process that the chef created to inspire our palate of the quality of food that Luke's is awarded in New Orleans and in the USA."}
{"input": "food is ok, felt rushed, too many tables and not enough space.  its very crowded and frequently had other servers and customers bumping into our chairs."}
{"input": "Kinda a dive bar but could have been cool.  We found the girl bartender to be pretentious and rude.  All she seemed to care about is rushing through our order so she could go back and talk to her friends and giving smart ass answers every time you asked her a question."}
{"input": "So... ima make this very short and simple just got a haircut from this place, thought I would check it out because of the great reviews of yelp.. worst haircut of my life.. it seemed like the hair stylist had no idea what she was doing. My hair is completely uneven. So bad I actually felt like crying and I am a 20 year old guy. I went to a different barber shop later that day so they could shave my head. Maybe they cut women's hair really nice but guys do not come here unless you want people laughing at your haircut."}
{"input": "We knew we had to wait in line, but the wait inside for food and drinks was ridiculous.  The waiter took a long time to come, she never checked on us and we had to get up 3 times to ask her for coffee and milk refills.  The pancakes are just OK, honestly IHOP has better pancakes.  Not impressed at all."}
{"input": "My friends and I went on Voodoo Bone Lady's Infamous City Of The Dead Cemetery Tour with Bri as our guide.  We loved Bri and we loved the tour!  She was so bubbly and knowledgeable, and the time went by so fast.  We were thoroughly impressed.  Even with the larger size of the group we were still able to hear Bri and enjoy ourselves.  I would definitely go on a tour with this company and this guide again.\nSide note to Bri:  We did a taste test between Willie Mays and Popeye's and it was no contest!  Wille Mays won all the way!  Dooky Chase was right up there with Willie Mays.  Thank you again for a great tour."}
{"input": "The food was pretty tasty. Nothing outstanding though. It reminds me of any Mediterranean food truck that I've been to. It's a nice late night spot. Definitely hits the spot at the end of the night. To me, the amount of food you get for the price could be improved but I would not say that I feel ripped off. The amount of food you get is fair but I think it'd be easier to justify if you got a little more. \n\nThere's plenty of seating. Despite being near a whole bunch of bar/club scenes, once you're inside it's easy to take a break and have a nice conversation. It is all very clean and well kept. The servers are quick and friendly. When I went there were only two guys working but they weren't busy so it didn't take too long. The entire restaurant is very dimly lit and the atmosphere is a bit of a hodgepodge of things. On one wall there is a mural of outer space and the music that plays seems to have no rhyme or reason to it. \n\nIt's a bit of a strange place but I would definitely go back."}
{"input": "This place's posted hours include a 10PM closing time. \n\nI walked in at 8:30 and, as soon as I got to the counter, the guy said to me \"kitchen's closed.\" The grill, fryers, etc were all being covered up. \n\nFirst of all, if your kitchen is closed, why is the door to your restaurant unlocked? \n\nSecondly, I could see this being the case if I walked in at, say, 9:55PM. But 8:30? That's ridiculous."}
{"input": "I am a Houston resident and stopped here driving through.  It was late at night and some other places nearby were closed.  The owner was happy to see us and served us immediately.  I have to say, my daughter and I agreed, it was the BEST Chinese we have ever had.  I grew up in NY, went to Chinatown regularly, and have a lot of restaurants here given the large Asian population on the Gulf Coast.  Let's just say we had dinner and then ordered take out for the next day!  Get the crab puffs.  Only time I have had them with real crab meat, not crab flavored cream cheese.  We will go out of our way to go back again..."}

{"input": "Whoa, I feel I must come to their defense. My daughter is 23 and they were her first and only dentists. I feel their dentistry is fine. I do remember that 18 years ago the receptionist told me I should change my name to match my daughter's name. (so they would know where to apply the check I sent in for payment - which they cashed anyway). Other than that, the care and service has always been good."}
{"input": "My mother booked this hotel for a 1 night stay so we could take my 5 nieces and nephews to Nashville shores and this location was literally 5 minutes away. We had some issues with the owners who ran the place. They weren't the best or friendliest. And the morning of check out, they were impatiently looking through windows and knocking on doors to see who was still in there. It was 8am and they were knocking on doors trying to see when we were checking out when check out was at 11. The hotel was basic but clean. Room was actually a decent size and TV was satellite with several channels. There was also an outdoor pool that the kids got in and enjoyed. Rooms have a a fridge and microwave. They have a simple continental breakfast. All in all, hotel was fine for a one night stay."}
{"input": "Grabbed 2lbs of wings for the family on the way home.  They were a hit!  Next time though, I'll get 3lbs for 2 adults and 2 young boys."}

{"input": "The entire team at this company knows what they are doing! Great service backed-up by a thorough paint job at our office. They even agreed to paint over the weekend to minimize disruptions to our staff during the work week. I would hire them again with complete confidence."}
{"input": "Couldn't say it better than the below poster. Excellent food, service and prices.\n\nLocated where Mugshots used to be (RIP), one of my coworkers had been raving about this place, in particular the falafel and of course the very kind owner.\n\nWent with my pre-wife and we shared beef gyro (carved) pita, falafel pita and hummus plate. Everything was extremely fresh (I concur on the crisp lettuce) well seasoned and just plain delicious.  A lot of food as well and complimentary baklava. We took our leftovers home (I wrapped the two remaining bites of my gyro - it's that good)\n\nI highly recommend this place and you'll definitely walk out with a smile. I think this spot is still relatively unknown and I very rarely post reviews. This is a unique spot to Manayunk and I will be referring all of my friends as I really want the restaurant to succeed - because the owner deserves it and of course for my selfish appetite!"}
{"input": "Fried chicken paradise in the Treme. This place smells like home-cooked fried chicken before you even open the door and it just gets more heavenly when you walk inside. Briny, meaty, crispy and all of the qualities you look for in a good piece of fried chicken. \nLike many of NOLA's best restaurants, the interior is nothing special and the exterior is unassuming, but don't be put off. Yummy delicousness awaits."}
{"input": "Staff makes this place. I am here now. I REALLY love this place. Great pizza great atmosphere. GREAT staff. This place is the best. Haven't tried it, need to!"}
{"input": "The best soon-dubu in the city!  This place is tucked away and once you walk in, it's like you've stepped into a Korean home.  Very welcoming, warm and inviting.\n\nIt's very vegetarian friendly!  The soft tofu is stewed and put into the dol sot pots which each and every stew feels like it's custom made for you. \n\nYou can select from beef, seafood or mixed meats (seafood & beef), mushroom, and just plain.  They can adjust the spice as needed too.  I always get the extra hot with the hot temperature, can't beat it.  The rice also comes in a dol-sot which is great if you leave it in for a while, it burns the rice into a nice crispy shell.  DROOL.\n\nJust thinking about this place makes my mouth salivate!  \n\nIf you're not into tofu, they also offer korean bbq meats (cooked in the back), with other soup/stew items.\n\nLove this place!!!"}
{"input": "Love this spot! I've been here twice now, trying different dishes each time, and the food is consistently very good. \n\nFood: get the fried chicken. Also, get the Mac and cheese. You can feel guilty about it later. \n\nAtmosphere: cute and cozy with I've music. Just be warned that sitting near the musician means you won't be able to hear much of anything else. \n\nService: always prompt and courteous!"}
{"input": "I went to Brio for the first time on Wednesday for dinner with my friend since a friend of us recommended it. Our first impression was \"Wow, this is a very nice restaurant.\" The restaurant is absolutely beautiful. The servers are professional and very attentive. I treated myself an order of single Tuscan Grilled Porkchop with Roasted Garden Vegetables while my friend went straight for the Shrimp Mediterranean. My porkchop was incredibly moist and tender. There was a thin layer of crunchy fat wrapping about the piece of meat, which actually gave it more flavor and texture. The portion was reasonable so that I did not feel like I was stuffing myself but actually celebrated the food. We, however, did not have the chance to try out their dessert collection. I personally do not think this was a bad thing since it would give us an excuse to come back here for another time and enjoy the food."}

Excellent texture and flavour  my sandwich was filled with tender beef cheese and their homemade candied beets  large portions rustic decor. Open kitchen.   Vegans stay home although their roasted veg side dish was great!!!!\nI need to go back and try brunch! real meat. Real cooking. Oh and dark rye.  Yum"}
{"input": "This Walgreens is in a great location off Veteran's and is very clean. The downside is that they're always understsffed. No one mans the Photo area so you normally have to wait for someone to finish with a line of customers or wait for someone to come from the back. Pharmacy is not as bad but expect to wait in line to check out."}
{"input": "Hidden gem in olde city. Fun bar that has some really good sweet potato fries! The fries are on steroids and come with some honey horseradish sauce that are a dream come true. I devoured those bad boys like they were my last meal. Believe the hype!\n\nOur party sat by the jukebox right by the bathrooms, but the music was way too loud for a casual Sunday evening. I have to work tomorrow, and I need my voice! I don't need to shout over to a friend right across for me. If they can fix that, then I'll be a happy woman. I just won't share my fries."}
{"input": "Not good! Maybe a bad cook or off night and most things are worth giving a second chance but not sure id try again unless i was in the area. Chicken/broccoli was flavorless, kung pao shrimp weak and the boneless spareribs where bland. 0-3, is not good!"}
{"input": "This place is absolutely fantastic. I honesty really don't even like sweets and am not all that into donuts but this place will make you a believer. The apple fritter is amazingly delicious and you can't go wrong with a chocolate long john. Don't even bother with any other donut shops in stl."}
{"input": "Ive eaten there twice and both times it was terrible. Steak was salty, fish dry, my salad was frozen , service awful. . Im really not sure how this place gets any good reviews."}
{"input": "Dont let the buildings past keep you away. The interior and food have undergone a complete remodel. The menu is a great version of modern American fare.\nService was pleasant as well as the flavors in the food. Be sure to order pepper jack cheese sticks with sriracha dipping sauce for a nice departure from the old mozzarella sticks.\nWe plan to return for dinner soon. You should plan to stop in and try a new Reno spot that's worth the gamble!"}
{"input": "Nice coffee and a pleasant escape if you have had enough of Reno's rundown casino charm."}
{"input": "Love this Rouses! The store is always immaculately clean (which is a huge plus for me), and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  The prices can be a bit high sometimes, so I don't go there for my 'big' grocery trips, but I do stop in a few times a week for things I run out of or forget.  Additionally, the hot bar, salad bar, and ready made meals are a go to for a quick but tasty lunch.  One thing that stands out is if the store doesn't have something,  they can order it and call you when it's in. One of the employees in the frozen foods section named Alton was extremely helpful in getting a hard to find item ordered for me and personally called me when it was in. Amazing customer service!"}
{"input": "I was starving and was looking for something to eat on eat24. I can't really drive and go to places to dine in because I just had a newborn and its not easy getting around sometimes so I was looking for something via delivery. \n\nSo since I haven't had tacos in a long time I decided to give this place a try with all the good reviews I'd see. Sorry to say it wasn't the best tacos I've had in Philly. I'd ordered the tacos al pastor. It tasted sweet with little to no flavor and I had asked for the red spicy sauce but why was there green spicy sauce on my tacos? Although I like how you can choose your own toppings but it wasn't my kind of tacos. I love trying new places and once I found the place that fits my expectations I just stick to that one place but this one wasn't for me . I've ordered burrito for my boyfriend's daughter and the portion was huge but I took a bite and it was just okay. I'm not really a fan of burrito anyway. \n\nDelivery was quick but I don't think I'll be return."}
{"input": "The crappy Indiana roads blew one of my tires on my CTS on I465N. I was able to drive to them and they changd my tire at 11 pm at night in no time!! Thanks Guys!!"}
{"input": "We called ahead and picked up at the drive through window after leaving the kids ballgame. We ordered 3 kids meals and a poboy. The kids meals came with fries, yogurt, a rice krispy treat and a drink for $5 each. The kids were full, the food was good and it was all for 26 dollars. The shrimp and burgers are both really good. We will be back."}
{"input": "Yum! We go on Sundays when kids eat free. Family of 5 eats dinner for under $25. Bar-b-q is yummy, nice portions, and free ice cream. I like pulled pork and the beef brisket, if you go late they may be sold out of some meats. \n\nMy only complaint is the dining room is small and during dinner time there is a long wait for food and sometimes a seat. Despite this it's a family favorite."}
{"input": "Finally, a place in New Hope with unique, high quality food. I expected everything to be spicy as is my experience with Cuban food previously.  Rich flavor characterized our meals best.  I can't wait to go back and try something else."}
{"input": "We didn't stay here, but spent a lot of time here between the casino, arcade, spa, and Island Buffet. It is very clean and fun inside. I especially liked the selfie screen, where you can change the screen to any location in the world. If you are here- check out the Island buffet for dinner! The spa is great, and the Arcade is filled with 80s and today's games. Good for people of any age!!"}
{"input": "If the line is out the door don't be turned off! The line goes very quickly and the food is well worth the wait. Every staff member is extremely friendly and helpful."}
{"input": "Little puzzled by some of the negative reviews. I ordered the BBQ sub this afternoon and it was pretty epic. Would definitely order again!"}
{"input": "Just finished a State Street Kitchen, Grilled Chicken, Spinach, Swiss and Honey Mustard Sub.  To kick it up a notch I stuffed in Jalapeno Chips for a spicy crunch. \nIt was great on an afternoon when autumn is starting to assert itself with bluster.  \n\nThis excellent local establishment continues to turn out first rate creative dishes thanks to the ever-present Micha, and her friendly staff.  It has become my most constant breakfast companion, and often my lunch date, as well.  \n\nIf you have not been in for a taste of home cooking with a Korean flare, you don't know what you are missing. \n\nFind a way to get there.  Sit down and become part of the family."}
{"input": "Pad Kra Pao is the most exceptional dish that I have experienced in Nashville's Thai offerings! Fresh ground spicy pork with the right amount of freshly grown (in house) basil with a few fresh vegetables served with rice and a very tasty fried egg. \n\nI am addicted and when I am entertaining guests, I feel compelled to bring them to this wonderful treasure of a place. \n\nThe service is prompt encouraging a diner to enjoy a meal, but to make way for other guests standing at the door. It's not a rushed experience...but let's keep it moving so that others can enjoy this fresh and tasty spot!"}
{"input": "Con artists work here. I ordered chicken and rice, which they advertise 1 entree and one side for $4.99. I go to pay and they charge me $6 and change. Very slight difference but somehow I noticed it and questioned it. The woman said I didn't say I wanted the $4.99 then said she gave me double meat. If that was double meat I would hate to see a regular order. I know it's only a dollar but it's the principle. I get that chick fil a is taking their business and that's why I wanted to help them out, next time I'm going to chick fil a. \n\nBummer because the food was pretty good."}
{"input": "The service was Ahmazing! The Meat burrito was delicious and served with great sauce!! The ambiance is real chill! I recommended this place to anyone visiting New Orleans or who lives in the city!"}
{"input": "Why this place is so awesome I have no idea. Chili cheese etoufee with extra bread is the way to do it. Wanna mix it up? Get a half a half with chili cheese etoufee and something else. No idea why the one in Bloomington is called Dats now."}
{"input": "You can't go wrong with the brunch at Luke!  I always get the fried chicken and waffles.  It comes with cane syrup and gravy on the side.  Ummm!  On a weekday, it is good for lunch or dinner with friends or the hubby.  I recommend the Luke burger (even though I believe it is sacrilegious to order a burger at an establishment such as this, however this is THE exception!) The flamenkutche is really good, too.  It is like a German pizza.  I also enjoy the cochondelait poboy, shrimp & grits, and croque madame , which are excellent.  We are never disappointed and always enjoy the ambiance of the old style New Orleans  restaurant."}
{"input": "Food was actually quite good, and the place has definite New Orleans style and character that I like.  The service was quite poor, though.  I usually read reviews complaining about service with a huge grain of salt and tend to ignore them as coming from whiners who find fault everywhere.  But when I took my family to Jack Dempsey's this weekend, it was the worst service I have had in years.  Inattention, getting the order wrong, very long delays while the waitress was clowning around with old friends at another table (which was not even her table).  I won't be going back, which is a shame because I liked the place and the fried seafood was well above average."}
{"input": "The chicken sandwich was phenomenal. Great food for a very industrial area."}
{"input": "Sierra Air Conditioning and Heating has been great for us. If you are interested in the best in HVAC services or just need a stand alone ductless air conditioning unit from Mitsubishi they've got you. They do duct work cleaning, furnace repair - heating installation and air conditioning sales and service with installation. I am a committed customer to Sierra Air Conditioning and Heating!"}
{"input": "Great flavored food and good service! The spring rolls were awesome! I had seen reviews stating the food was greasy, but ours was all cooked perfectly and fresh tasting!"}
{"input": "So disappointing on so many levels. Have been coming here for years - and the quality of food has fallen off a cliff. Strike one - we shared an artichoke to start - and clearly it had been prepared beforehand (eg, cold on the inside - but the flesh was cooked through)  Strike two - my wife had a Greek salad - and it clearly all came from a bag and was extremely overdressed with tasteless dressing.  Strike three - I had grilled yellowtail which was basically execrable - could not even finish it (overcooked and an inferior-frozen piece of fish - unacceptable for SB). \n\nIn short - great setting, good service - but with such horrible food - not worth the visit. This place really needs to up the quality of food - or it's going to end up just another lower State dive for the tourists."}
{"input": "Another gem on Frenchmen.  We made it in just in time to grab the corner tall table and enjoyed the piano player playing some nice tunes.\n\nOrder at the bar and they'll bring you the food.  What we had:\npork pot stickers - pretty good - $4 HH price\nsmoked hanger steak w/ chimichurri sauce on toastones - tasted much better than it looked - $4 HH price\nlobster eggrolls w/ sweet chile lime sauce - $8 - didn't look promising but it was tasty\nHopitoulas - $4.5\nUFO - $4.5\n\nOne of the owners/chefs is Korean, thus the Asian food.\n\nHH everyday from 4-6:30pm, $4 tapas, $5 wines, $3 beers.\n\nWe will definitely return."}
{"input": "Amazing place for good fun. Got engaged last night and brought my now fiance with me to the n crowd. Asked if they could do a little shout out for her. Not only did they do a shout out they did a skit renacting her entire day. Was hilarious and really made the night extra special. Highly recommend the N Crowd to anyone who likes to laugh and have fun. A++++++"}
{"input": "We started with a basic house margaritas and free chips and salsa.  The drinks were good and the salsa was great.  It was nice and chunky and filled with cilantro.  Next up were the steak fajitas.  They had a nice taste and the spice they used was just right.  The onions were heaped on the platter but there were so few poblano peppers as to be almost nonexistent.  And what happened to the nice red, white, and green Mexican flag presentation you normally see with fajitas?  No tomatoes!  To complete the \"flag\" I put a little salsa on top and that did the trick.\n\nAll in all the place was better than average.  Good, in fact.  We will certainly return to try more items on the menu."}
{"input": "Should give them 1 star for the quality of the work but I will give them 2 because they were able to take me as a walk-in. I wanted to get acrylics and since they did plain ole acrylics (unlike the 2 other salons I previously went to), I sat down and let the lady go to work. Halfway through she informed me that they would be $60 plus $5 for a french tip, so I might as well just get the gel for $70. For $70, these acrylic nails should be able to give me magical powers. Instead, they are uneven, transparent enough that my nail bed shines through, and cracking 2 days later. It took an hour and a half, they switched girls in the middle of the process and the quality is appalling. I highly suggest going to another nail salon in the area."}
{"input": "Based on previous experience, I chose Workshop for a meal with friends.  We reserved a table and since it was one of the last reservations of the night, the place was fairly empty.  \n\nSadly the kitchen was slow.  We were the last table of the night and our mains took an hour to get to our table.  I ordered the pirogies (which have changed from a month or two back).  They were fairly cold, the side vegetables weren't cooked well and it was rather ho hum.\n\nTo drink I ordered a drink I had before, the Gin Gin Mule...I think they used tonic water instead of the ginger beer.\n\nI'll try it again but this was definitely an off night."}
{"input": "This is a place we stop into every time we visit NOLA. Its become a great staple in all of our trips. The food is filled with love and flavor. You can tell the staff love what they do and really put their heart and soul into the food. They have the best gumbo I've ever tasted!"}
{"input": "This place is terrible. Terrible service, terrible food, and the place is dirty beyond reason.  Really hope I don't have food poisoning after eating here, but I wouldn't bet on it."}
{"input": "If you're looking for a restaurant with ample options, Hollywood Grill has got you covered. From all day breakfast options to sandwiches, burgers, pasta, seafood, meat entrees and dessert, there's something for everyone on the menu. However, with a large selection quantity comes limited quality. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and had to pull out almost all of my chicken because it looked and tasted suspicious. My sister ordered the French dip and found the meat to be really dry. One item I did like was the chili. The bowl portion is served in a ceramic platter and is almost large enough to be a full meal. The price range for sandwiches is around $9-$13 while the entrees are closer to $15 and seafood is over $20. I can't imagine their seafood being fresh though so the price seems a bit high. The restaurant opens at 6 am each day so I feel as if it's better as a casual breakfast spot than one I would go to for lunch or dinner."}
{"input": "The right place for the best authentic-tasting NY bagels. The wrong place if you're looking for a smile."}
{"input": "This is my go-to neighborhood bar. The ambiance is awesome (I love all the cool retro lighting they have) the staff is friendly, and the food is solid. We typically like to go on the later side of the evening, around 10 or 11. At that hour, I don't see how you could have any issues with servers or food. What I really like about his place is that the menu is really seasonal. They always have something new and interesting to try. I particularly remember a really great  Arugula and Watermelon salad I had over the summer. Go and enjoy!"}
{"input": "Delicious! Had starters of prawns in a spicy sauce and cauliflower florets in a tangy  glaze. Entrees were chicken korama, vindaloo, and xacuti. Also had garlic naan. \n\nAll delicious!!!"}
{"input": "Crazy good food. Not the fastest service but totally worth the wait. I had the savory spinach and mushroom bread pudding and it was ridiculously good. Probably the best coffee that I have had while in New Orleans. On top of that the prices are very inexpensive. A definite \"must do\" while in New Orleans."}
{"input": "ROB IS THE BEST! A lot of regulars hangout here! Mostly older crew, but depending on the night there's young folks too! It is a VERY comfortable bar, friendly family atmosphere! \nOne of the three bars in Carmel you can actually smoke in! It's a plus if your a smoker-if not don't bother going. You will leave smelling like smoke! They also have pool leagues, and they are very competitive! Come play!\nThere is also darts and pull tabs!!!\nIf you like to sing come on a Saturday night, they do karaoke and have about every song you can think of! Come sing!\nIt's all around one of my favorite bars in Carmel, if you haven't been come in and check it out! \nAsk for Rob at the bar, he will take care of you with fast and friendly service! And if your lucky he will entertain you with his corny jokes!"}
{"input": "Good selection of donuts. A lot of very sweet donuts. Sliders are good. Donuts are average. Service excellent. Cinnamon roll tasted just like Cinnabon with less frosting. It needed more cinnamon."}
{"input": "Love the interiors. Makes the whole place really interesting! The room was very clean and service was great."}
{"input": "i love sun tan city! the girls are always so nice. especially the manager. they're helpful, great saleswomen, and know what they're talking about. they don't just want your money but want to get to know you & help you as much as possible as you tan. i've been to several STC and this by far is my favorite just because of the cleanliness and customer service! if you're in nashville and need a tan - go here:)"}
{"input": "I loved it.... Food was good and I love the atmosphere drinks were great!!! It's really a upscale version of the Cheesecake Factory."}
{"input": "Nice dinner on recent Monday night.  Had a nice business dinner on a recent Monday evening.  Love the grilled octopus salad appetizer.  Salmon was also excellent.  Service was professional.  Heavily Italian wine list could use some helpful explanations for those not so expert in wines from this country."}
{"input": "Pretty sure that in a previous life I was Daisy Buchanan. It's the only explanation for my unreasonable passions for Art Deco and gin. Every time I go to the Fountain on Locust, I'm transported back into that previous life. I mean - a former Stutz showroom, the booths, the deco light fixtures, the murals on the walls, the tile floor and the cocktails!  This place could be a gimmicky, tourist-trap-y kind of place. But it's not. The food,  desserts and cocktails would hold their own in plainer setting. And the servers are friendly and efficient. I love this place."}
{"input": "Man, it has been a long time. My first encounter with this pub was back in 1991 in my Navy days. Some friends of mine and I were cramming nachos and margaritas at Los Amigos (which I am not sure exists still), and being silly sailors at the bar. He sits next to us and he invites our rowdy foursome for a drink on him at his place down the way, Brownies. He had us squids at \"drink on him\".\n\nDecor was comfy and easygoing, and I see it hasn't changed. Service was friendly and fun. Drinks we paid for were good and not too pricey. We came back several times and always left pretty happy. Maybe someday soon I will darken Brownie's door and relive them good times."}
{"input": "Some cool stuff... mostly from large kitsch companies (Kikkerland, Fred...). But some different stuff too, and a local jewelry section (which was probably the best part). Everything seemed a little overpriced, but that is common with stores like this.\n\nI think they're trying, I'm just sick of seeing the same stuff in every store in every town. It's called Indy... you'd think there would be more independent stuff going on."}
{"input": "Around the street from our hotel this place was great for morning coffee and a pastry.\n\nJust had hot tea and a blueberry muffin.  Looks like there's a local crowd that adds to the atmosphere.  Very nice place."}
{"input": "Salads are delish, although a bit pricey at $7.75 a pop. I felt the healthful salad eating justified a cookie though, and damn was that money well spent. They do baked goods and coffeehouse drinks, as well as bread-y and salad-y treats very well. \nGreat lunch spot, eat outside on a sunny day!"}
{"input": "Pretty good food, service could've been better but I'm not one to complain especially if the food is good."}
{"input": "Ordered the Veg sandwich from here and pasta salad, and they were decent.  The veg sandwich had a lot of good flavor, but after eating half of it it started to feel a little too vinegar-y.  It would've been better had there been more vegetables (it's just a thin layer of grilled zucchini) and if it were warm.  But they're very generous with the goat cheese! The pasta salad is decent, but not worth $2.75 for such a small portion."}
{"input": "Incredible. Everything was perfect. The right portion size, the right flavor balances, good cocktails, and awesome beer. We're not from New Orleans but we will drive the three hours from where we live just to come again!!!"}
{"input": "One of my favorites in downtown Franklin! Tried a bunch of stuff on the menu but the rusty bucket is always my favorite.  Everything I've ordered has tasted great and been of high quality. I've also always had good service and usually recommend it to folks from out of town! Neat atmosphere, especially when the weather is nice and you can sit outside by the wine bar area!"}
{"input": "This is hands down my favorite coffee spot. I don't understand why the Starbucks on Broad Ripple Ave gets so much business because Monon blows them out of the water. Delicious drinks, a wide variety of coffees and tasty pastries make this a must see if you're in the neighborhood. The honor bar is great for those times you just want some coffee and need to get in and out in a hurry."}
{"input": "Ate on a Saturday around 2 PM - since it was a later lunch there were tons of available tables, which was nice. \n\nApple Tree Goat Cheese with Basil Pesto Bruschetta - SO good. This one was my favorite of the two we tried.\n\nPistachio Herbed Ricotta with Lavender Honey Bruschetta - this was my husbands favorite bruschetta - it was also very good!\n\nRoasted Beet Salad - loved it. There was A LOT of goat cheese, so if you don't care for it as much, then ask for them to go light on it. I love goat cheese myself, so it worked out well. It was light, but there was enough to make lunch filling.\n\nClaudio Mozzarella Sandwich - 4/5 stars - really tasty. He thinks it would have been better if the prosciutto weren't crispy since he felt it lost some of its flavor. \n\nFlourless Chocolate Torta - a good end to the meal. Not TOO much - just enough for two people! \n\nThis was probably our favorite meal we had in Philadelphia and would definitely recommend!"}
{"input": "Took the Grapes N Hops tour with Shawn.  My wife and I had a fantastic time!  There were three wineries and a stop at Figueroa Brewing to end the tour.  Sogno del Fiori was our favorite stop.  The owner is very cordial and has a true depth of knowledge reagarding all aspects of wine.  We had a great time on the tour and I would highly recommend this company."}
{"input": "They have combination deals that make rolls and sushi super cheap! The rolls are definitely on the smaller side, so you'll need to order up on the combination deal if you want to get full. Sashimi was actually more fresh than I thought it would be, considering the price! \n\nAlso, the joint is sort of small, and the service is slow, but the place is BYO, so you can just head downstairs and bring up some beers while you're waiting."}
{"input": "I've been to five other juice bars in the Tampa Bay Area. This is the only one that has my business! Great quality. Ironically the prices at other juice bars are higher. This place is legit."}
{"input": "Went for a bachelorette party on a Saturday night in April. Definitely try to arrive on the earlier side! We got there at 8 and there was no line (by the time we left at around 11 there was a line down the street). The cover band is awesome. There were at least 10 other bachelorette groups there and a few 50th birthday parties too. Their signature cocktails are great but overpriced in my opinion. I would go back though for another bachelorette party or birthday. Probably wouldn't try if it was any regular night out. Gets very crowded."}
{"input": "I really liked the place however they need a bus boy at the pool people left their dirty plates and no one came to pick them up there were dirty dishes everywhere when we got to the pool it was gross!"}
{"input": "Service is awful. I've been here several times and no matter how slow or how busy the restaurant is, it takes at least 2 hours to eat here. The waitstaff is generally friendly and the food is decent. Just don't get bottle caps. You get a ton of mushy okra and almost no pickles."}
{"input": "Was not impressed at all. We were going to eat st IHOP but since the wait time was way too long for three kids we walked over to 5 guys. First off the prices are nuts ...a burger was like 6.99 and comes with no fries so I thought well maybe it's a big burger. Nope a regular Mcdonalds size burger. The fries were loaded down with salt...it felt like I was eating a pound of salt. Then I ordered the veggie sandwich. I'm thinking I'm getting a veggie burger nope it's just onions peppers mushroom on a bun. Super disgusting! It was almost $50 for us to eat at a fast food joint and the food was gross!  I could have went to Mcdonalds and had dessert lunch and breakfast for that price and had a better meal. My husband used to work at a 5 guys in SC and as I remember the fries came with the burger as a meal fresh in a bag and the burgers were huge! We had to take half of it home. \nI would not recommend this place at all especially if your on a budget."}
{"input": "Tucked on 76 Ave is a small cozy cafe, usually filled with local students because there aren't too many parking spots. The prices at this cafe are a bit higher than that of Remedy, and the seating arrangements are tight. There are large comfy seats and more table seating. It is convenient and quite accessible to the neighborhood, although higher prices will incur. Ambient noise would be higher due to the smaller space.\n\nMosaic cafe is very similar, however space and table seating are also an issue."}
{"input": "I am visiting from Chicago and stopped for dinner.  Food is VERY salty which any Thai cook will tell you is a big no no.  It is more Chinese style on stir fry's and they burned the fried rice.  Service very slow also."}
{"input": "Came here with a group of 15 people on a Tuesday night. We had reserved a space in advance. \nWhile the food was good, what was lacking was good service and cleanliness. We sat down at our table and it was sticky, and there was a dirty and also sticky fork still on it...so the assumption was that the table simply hadn't been wiped down all the way. Yuck. \nWe ordered and the food took a fair amount of time, understandable because of such a large party. Problem was, when the food came out, no server knew what we'd individually ordered, so it became a huge mix up with people eating others' food. \nI ordered the pork belly tacos which had a great caramelization on the outside and tender inside. I also ordered the spicy beef pho, which was perfectly balanced with flavor after adding the accompanying bean sprouts and limes. \nThe wait for the check and processing payment was long and arduous, a problem again because we had a Lyft driver waiting outside for us. \nAll in all, go for the food, not for the service."}
{"input": "I love Simone and her French boutique themed bakery. My mom's birthday cake last year was wonderful. I drop in often for croissants, macaroons and other sweet treats at least once a week. Weekend tea parties are amazing but reservations are needed. They also have additional all age events that occur monthly. It's such a fun, posh, family oriented business. Once you get s cake from here you'll never go to Sam's, Costco or Schnucks ever again."}
{"input": "I have a hard time imagining a better breakfast than the Chicken biscuits. We were seated with no wait and had great service. Perfect brunch."}
{"input": "Offers \"All you can eat to go\" but follows and tells you what food you can and cannot have without charging extra after paying full price. \n\nWould give No stars if I could."}
{"input": "I agree with some of the previous reviews, which are less than satisfactory.  The drive-through was defectively designed and constructed -  it is too narrow and too winding. It shouldn't be too hard to re-construct it to make it easier to get through. More importantly, the customer service needs to be improved.  I went there recently and ordered coffee, and clearly stated that I wanted it with no sugar.  The girl at the window handed me the coffee, which was loaded with sugar.  I went through again, and asked for what I ordered.  Another employee gave me another coffee, made as I originally ordered, but she made no apology, and seemed annoyed. This is at least the second time that I received an incorrect order at this location. The other three McDonald's locations I go to, in less prestigious neighborhoods, have much better customer service."}
{"input": "I have walked by this restaurant countless times, so sweetheart and I finally ventured in.  First observation was that only 2 small tables were full when we arrived, yet I needed a haircut by the time our food arrived.  Second, I ordered a mild chicken dish (which was down-right bland), and sweetheart ordered a spicy seafood dish, which was absolutely ridiculously hot.  I do not exaggerate when I say that 1/3 red hot chili peppers.  Virtually inedible!  This restaurant is clearly a horror, living off of the tourists.  No Philly dweller would frequent this place."}
{"input": "If you have the chance, eat here! Food is fresh and so tasty. Amazing service. I have never done a review on yelp before. May not again but loved this place so much I felt compelled to share."}
{"input": "We went to Carisma Restaurante again tonight. It has become our \"go to\" spot. The food is excellent and the service was great. The owner Jose is very friendly and tries to visit every table to make sure everyone is satisfied.  Tonight we had 2 Paellas, salmon and a filet mignon. Everything was made to order, cooked to perfection and came out hot.  \n\nThe family also opened a cafe in front of the restaurant. Jose gave us a tour and introduced us to his daughter that runs the cafe. The baked goods and coffees at the cafe are just as good as the meals at Carisma. Good, fresh food prepared and served by nice people. Try Carisma, it's so much more than just the normal tacos and burritos. You wont be disappointed!"}
{"input": "Any breakfast place that I can remember six months after I've been there is...pretty much every breakfast place. What do you think I am? Some guy who can't remember breakfast places? How often do you think I eat breakfast somewhere other than my house? So often that I can't even recall where it was?\n\nCome on. Moon's? Yes, I remember Moon's. They had a gluten-free something and I ordered it.\n\nSee? Nailed it."}
{"input": "I got this deal on hotwire great price, great location, and would definitely stay again."}
{"input": "Whisk is my favorite bakery in St. Louis. Their brownie in particular is fantastic, and I also dig their scones. Besides the great eats, the shop itself is also very charming and inviting."}
{"input": "Good luck finding anyone to help you.  Poor poor customer service."}
{"input": "I took an 8 year old and a 14 year old for the lunch special pizza.  We have done this on several occasions, and the kids love that they each get their own personal pizza, made the way they like.   They both ordered their pizza with 2 items and wanted BBQ sauce as the base instead of tomato sauce.  (this is the only way they enjoy pizza).   I was told that they could only get tomato sauce, not BBQ sauce.   I explained that we have gotten it this way several times before.   We were told that they don't offer it this way any more.   I see that some of the pizzas offer BBQ sauce and pointed it out, but again was told that it couldn't be made this way for them.   I asked if I could pay additional to have it made with BBQ sauce, but once again told it was not possible.   Sadly, we left the restaurant and chose a different nearby restaurant for lunch.  I'm sorry to say I won't be able to take the kids here anymore."}
{"input": "We had an amazing meal and experience! \n\nThe service is wonderful - attentive and knowledgable and the ingredients and the preparation. \n\nEvery bite was delicious as is the $55 price for the 4 course tasting menu. The gruyere popover was hot and savory and the perfect popover. I could eat a large bowl of the foie gras soup with the flavors of thai chilies and lemon grass. Both pastas were divine - the rigatoni with carrot top pesto with rabbit (prob the best dish of the night) and the saffron bucatini with blue crab with a little spice from fresno chillies. We had the fried game hen and the tile fish for mains. The tile fish was fine but couldn't compete with the flavor explosion of the game hen although the shrimp dumplings were tasty - wish there were more.  Desserts were a luscious semifreddo and carrot cake.\n\nDrinks were well made but overpriced compared to the price point of the tasting menu (obvi to make some $$$).\n\nCan't wait to go back. Wish we had more $55 tasting menus in NYC."}
{"input": "I used college hunks to move in June of 2016 and I just LOVE them. Harry and John were so helpful and professional, I still remember them 2 years later. The prices were competitive but what helped me was that they gave me a quote over the phone after giving them an estimate of how much I had to move rather than coming out to see it, that worked much better for my lifestyle. My apartment was a little tough to maneuver with my stairs and they were able to get every piece of furniture in no problem. I was so nervous but Harry and John really put me at ease! They were finished unloading my truck in 45 minutes, they put everything where I asked them to."}
{"input": "Decent place to get a drink and usual diner/bar food. It's always really crowded, and I'm not really sure why- maybe because most diners don't have liquor licenses.\n\nLarge portions of usual diner fare."}
{"input": "Three things that are good about Jackson's:\n1. Patio\n2. Happy Hour\n3. Good location for after work drinks\n\nThe food really isn't worth the calories or the money. Last time I visited I ordered the Rio Roll which my waitress told me was the most popular torrad. What it was: flavorless grilled chicken, bland probably pre-prepared guacamole, and watery flavorless diced tomatoes, wrapped in a crispy on the outside, gummy on the inside spinach tortilla. Delicious? Not really. The side salad was good with the champagne vinaigrette which was heavy on the vinegar. I've had the nachos and I wouldn't order them again. \n\nWhy only three stars? It's not stellar. It's \"A-OK\". The 2 for 1 happy hour is nice and the location is a great starting point. I would just recommend whipping out your Yelp App if you start to get hungry."}
{"input": "This place is super unprofessional. The manager who says his name is \"Johnson\" is extremely unprofessional. He doesn't understand that when working in a place of business where people are accompanied by their children you cannot curse out loud. He also doesn't understand that of a customer comes in close to closing time you don't tell them to hurry up. I don't care how good the food is. I wouldn't know because I lost my appetite and left. This guy is trash. And the management should realize that he's a reflection of them and their business. Definitely stay away. If you're starving, eat air. This place is terrible"}
{"input": "Reasons to go here:\n1) Good location; within other nearby stores\n2) Descent food compared to other inexpensive fast food restaurants in the area\n3) Staff seems friendly enough\n4) Seems clean\n\n*I have only been here once, this experience may be an anomaly  \n\nReasons to avoid:\n1) T-888's love to eat here; j/k terminators don't eat.  That would be stupid."}
{"input": "Very underwhelmed by this location. I am a huge fan of the Lexington location and was very excited to try out the Nashville location. The food items were not flavorful and pretty bland for the prices. They did run out of key menu items and the service was pretty slow. I did enjoy they're outdoor seating area. I was expecting more since I LOVE the one in Lexington..."}
{"input": "My fiance and I had the best time at Red Piano. Both pianist were very talented. They sang/played music from 70s 80s 90s and today, they also take requests (great singing voices fyi). My favorite though was Billy Joel songs. Both entertainers had the crowd going and dancing. Tips are appreciated, but not required. You don't have to dance if you don't want to, the music is just as entertaining. The service was also very good, we got our drinks in an appropriate amount of time. The drinks were very delicious. Get there before 8, it's highly recommended!! You'll have a better chance in getting a seat. We'll be back next time."}
{"input": "Long wait but definitely worth it. Biscuits are on point!\n\nIf you're looking for good chicken, biscuits and honey look no further!\n\nBonus, they are everywhere."}
{"input": "We are very pleased with Penn Fertility.  We interviewed several fertility clinics and ultimately chose Penn and could not be happier that we did.  We are a same-sex couple that needed an egg donor and surrogate.  The third-party coordinator was amazing at helping us coordinate all of the moving pieces for our surrogacy journey, even when there were some kinks thrown in unexpectedly.  Dr. G was also a gem when helping us work through some less than typical situations that arose.  She made herself very available throughout the processes as we needed her.  That was incredibly appreciated during what is a very emotional process.  We ultimately had a successful pregnancy on the first try and had a baby within a year of our first visit to the clinic.  We cannot be happier and are over the moon with our little bundle of joy.  We plan on using Penn again to make him a big brother soon."}
{"input": "We wandered into this eatery quite by accident (we saw it on yelp after a morning of sightseeing) We were warmly greeted and served promptly. One had the meatloaf sandwich and one the shrimp scampi with linguine. Both entrees were fresh and wonderful. Tucson, you are fortunate to have this new restaurant/sports bar."}
{"input": "We were vacationing in the French Quarter for a few days and stumbled into Flanagan's Pub.  Our first stop was about 11am and there were just a few people, probably regulars by how the bartender greeted them.  We loved the place so much that we ended back in there 3 times in one day!\n\nWe talked with the bartenders, locals and tourists all just hanging out having a nice drink and listening to some punk rock music.  It was a nice change from the over-the-top bars on Bourbon St."}
{"input": "I was cleaning out my father's house.  The basement was a mess of junk collected over 50 years.  The 1-800-Got-Junk phone rep said, \"you just sit back and relax and let our people do everything.  You can leave your items where they are and we'll take care of it all.  She then explained the pricing.  The two young guys arrived the next day on time (at the beginning of the 2-hr window).   They surveyed the work, explained the pricing again, and gave me the option to cancel.  They then went about their work quickly and efficiently - and even cleaned and swept when they were done.  It was a bit pricey - but it saved me hours of work and the hassle of dump runs and/or renting a dumpster.  They also told me that they recycle and donate as much as they can.  I highly recommend this company, and would use them again."}
{"input": "Slow service with an attitude, filthy dining and restrooms. Figured the first time they were having a bad day. Because I was craving Taco Bell thought I would give this location a second shot. There were two customers in line ahead of me and after waiting ten minutes to order and looking around at the state of the place I should have walked out. Guess I'm a sucker for punishment. Take notice and get this place shaped up !"}
{"input": "My medical office had our Christmas party in 2016 at The Depot Craft Brewery Distillery.  Food was EXCELLENT.  Employees were courteous and professional.  We were in the upstairs large group gathering room, which was awesome. We had a bartender and servers all to ourselves.  Did I mention the food was EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nOnly con? Parking for us arriving at 5 pm was waaaaaaaay in the back behind the building and it was raining that night.  :("}
{"input": "Cincinnati's finest!  Skyline 3-Way chili, what could be better?  \nThey now have a hot and spicy cheese option that's was great."}
{"input": "Great breakfast place - got the Benedict and substituted out the bacon for avocado. Flavor was on point. Will Probably swapped out toast for English muffin."}
{"input": "Put this review on south street on accident, but here is my review. I took my big puppy Vader to doggie styles on Pine St. He was a smelly mess, but when he was finished with his \"spa\" treatment he looked amazing!!! A big shout out to the grooming and staff. Erin did an amazing job and you could see her true love for animals. Lily was very helpful and set me up with an account. The store was so cute. I'll be coming back!"}
{"input": "Ok beer. Ok food. We like breweries because we have a kid and like beer. So we go to a lot of breweries. The service was excellent. Food, beer, good"}
{"input": "Always love coming here with my kids.  Friendly staff that are very accommodating and friendly.  The food is amazing.  Friday and Saturday nights there is buffet as well as every day at lunch.  We haven't eaten anything here that isn't good.  It is our pick amongst the St. Louis area Indian restaurants.  Even though we live in Ballwin near a few other restaurants,  this one is worth the drive!"}
{"input": "This place was a great! It was first time in Philly and I was starving. The guy that took my order was super nice. I got the buffalo bello and a chocolate & vanilla milk shake ! My meat eating friend got the chick'n fajita wrap and he devoured it. Even the water was delicious with orange & lemon slices in it. I'm definitely going back next time I'm in Philly !!!"}
{"input": "Went to Luke during a bachelor party weekend which, on this night was 12 guys.\nWe made a reservation, but unfortunately they were not ready for us.  \n\nBut they had a bar area and we sat there and had some drinks, clams and oysters.\nThe service was very good as well.  \n\nOnce we were seated everyone ordered and seemed to enjoy their food.  But what I can say is, that we were mostly drunk already and just wanted to eat.\n\nThis place was had lots of New Orleans type dishes.  I went with a steak, not really sure why, but maybe because I was so hungry, I just wanted to be full.\n\nOther than that, I can't say anything really stuck out, but the service was good, my food was good and the staff was good."}
{"input": "Great spot for big groups! Order at least $400 dollars worth of food in the large 3rd floor karaoke room and get the room for free (for 3 hours). The karaoke machine is fairly up to date, plus they have the actual music videos. Food is good as well! \n\nWent on a Friday from 8-11 for a friend's birthday. We had probably 40 people in the room and we fit pretty comfortably. You have to order for the whole group (and they'll bring out the same dishes to each table) but so much food comes out and it's all pretty good so there shouldn't be an issue where someone has nothing they want to/can eat. The food is pretty standard for Chinatown in terms of taste and options, but if you're not sure what to get some popular dishes are: walnut shrimp, salt baked squid, steamed pot fish, and any veggie dish. Just get whatever you want, it'll all be good.\n\n*They're also really nice in dealing with drunken/rowdy groups, so this is where large groups go to get smashed."}
{"input": "Delicious ice cream!! Some other food to choose from. Service a bit slow but ice cream out of this world!!!"}
{"input": "Drinks are good view is nice. Had the cheese tray and some other apps. I was rudely told to not move seats in the lounge area because it would mess up orders for the kitchen, well we moved our seats to accommodate a large party next to us, to ensure another guests satisfaction, as a previous server I felt that was a very unprofessional comment. Also ordered the burger sliders and when I bit into it the grease slid down my wrist burning me and ruining my brand new top. Have been here a few times prob will not return"}
{"input": "We had lunch here on 12/20. Maui burger was flavorful, juicy and thick. Choc. shakes very good and thick. Calamari had good flavor, really good with lemon squeezed on. Fish & chips was great, very tender and flavorful. All & all, we really enjoyed our stop here!"}
{"input": "Can't get any better than real ice cream on a rainy day! The seasonal coconut almond joy ice cream was AMAZING! 'Bearcat' had all my favorite flavors: butter pecan, bananas, chocolate fudge, vanilla... super sweet, just my style! However, extremely big portions, but an ice cream lovers' paradise."}
{"input": "AWESOME experience at this funky joint. \n\nServer was super friendly and had the bartender make us off-menu drinks.\n\nMixologist was on point.\n\nFood? HELL YES. Black bean burger (hold the bun) with chips and salsa-- divine!"}
{"input": "My wife and I LOVE this place. The management is always very attentive and the service is excellent! Things to try: Tiger Roll, Pink Lady Roll, Tornado Roll. Ask for Billy he's our favorite. I highly recommend this place of others in the same area. Enjoy!"}
{"input": "I went here with a friend of mine for a delightful mid-morning / afternoon treat.  We browsed the farmers market and found some amazing honey, salsa, meats, and more!  Then, we ended up eating in the kitchen and it was delicious!  Followed by lunch we went to the store and bought some macaroons - which was my first time to have these delicacies and they were out of this world!  Overall, we had a lovely time!"}
{"input": "i had the seafood combo-catfish (and im talkin like 5 pounds of it), red beans and rice and coleslaw.  the food was pretty damn good.  well, the real reason we walked in to this place was due to the big sign out front: \"happy hour, mon-sat, 4pm-7pm, 2 for 1\"  Now THAT is what im talkin about.  i ordered a margarita...and being that i'm from California, i have extremely high standards for marg's.  wasn't bad, but really wasn't great... but food made up for it!"}
{"input": "I have new dental insurance and had to find a dentist in network and came across Music City Dental. Dr. Spurlin and her staff are great! They are very gentle and make sure the patient is comfortable at all times. I had to get a filling and am terrified of shots. I didn't even feel when Dr. Spurlin gave me my shot. I was offered a pillow, blanket and choice of watching a movie or listening to music. I had a pleasant experience and am definitely a permanent patient!"}
{"input": "I absolutely love this Market! I live in Southwest Philly, and I do not mind traveling to get what I love from this Market. The ground beef and babyback ribs are the freshest ever!!! Yes, it maybe a little pricy, but it's worth it! If I lived in Center City, I would shop there everyday! Literally! I highly recommend this for your grocery shopping!"}
{"input": "This store is TERRIBLE.  I will only run in for one or two things if I absolutely have to.  I love WalMart but this one - no matter when you go (I've even been at 5am) you will wait FOREVER and 9 out of 10 times the clerk won't talk to you... at all.  I've gotten a significant amount of items that were out dated, however they do have good prices overall and there is good parking. Oh -the ATM NEVER works too."}
{"input": "Just came through here this past weekend for some carryout. Again - Great food and service.\n\nMy favorite local Chinese restaurant."}
{"input": "My wife and I have been coming to Paradise for many, many years and always have an enjoyable experience. We even had a night cap there on our first date! The staff is friendly and attentive, the food is always consistent, and I believe they have the coldest Anchor Steam on tap in town! My only suggestion would be to add some new items to the menu, which they seem to not do very often if ever."}
{"input": "Folks may disagree with me, but I have to be the first to not give this restaurant the five stars that it is used to getting. I will first state the positives. The flavors of the curries and other stews are simply delicious; they are doing everything right with what seemed like very authentic tastes and aromas. Now here is my particular issue: this restaurant chooses to curry salmon. It is my fault, really, as I should have asked what fish was to be used in the curry fish dish. Had I known it was salmon I would have passed. Salmon is not a fish for curry, in my opinion. With that said, please note that this is a rather personal opinion and is based completely on the one issue. The restaurant is clean and the service provided is that from good people, no qualms on those points."}
{"input": "The best Thai we have ever eaten. We are foodies and travelers and by far were blown away by the flavor and freshness of the ingredients. Great service and atmosphere too. The place is a must."}
{"input": "This place is really, really good.\n\nThis is the only restaurant my Mexican boyfriend will eat at on Cherokee. Coming from San Antonio, I just refused to eat Mexican for a year after I got here. But Tarahumara is as real as it gets. As others have said, the menu is small but delicious. The salsa is awesome and the chips are hot. Everything is good and very home-style, the horchata is tasty, the gorditas are great. Ask for the sopaipillas, I'm not sure if they're on the menu but they ARE AMAZING - hot and crunchy and drizzled with dulce de leche."}
{"input": "After having been here, I would say that the food had great flavors for the taste buds and it was a unique experience.  Our server, Brian was no doubt a foodie... I've never seen anyone get so excited about food and discuss the ingredients in such detail with so much passion.  The food really was different and had unbelievable flavor.  Anyone who calls themselves a foodie should try this place.  I'm thinking they would be pleased with this place.  But, the portions were small.  And I really didn't like the interior of the restaurant.  I'm more of a booths girl.  Booths can be classy, you know?  All in all, I would say this was an interesting place and I would come back, but the dishes were too complicated for me to want to come back beyond once a year.  Speaking of timing, the chefs change the menu every year.  And these guys really are good at what they do.  The owners actually own the Red Pony and two other restaurants all on the same street!  And they're all doing well."}
{"input": "This place is so amazing! Love the food, the staff is incredibly friendly and the atmosphere is unbeatable. I love sitting by their wood burning fire place to enjoy a late dinner. I personally think Cyrano's is the most well managed and appealing restaurant in Webster Groves. This place is top tier."}
{"input": "Hiring I Like to Move It was the best choice I could have made. They took the stress out of my move by loading the truck extremely fast while still taking care of my belongings and making sure nothing got damaged. The unloading process was very fast as well and they had a friendly and professional attitude at all times. They also had the lowest rate out of all the movers I contacted through Yelp. I definitely recommend hiring them!"}
{"input": "This nail salon has competitive pricing when compared to other salons in the area.  I loved the fact that their \"deluxe\" pedicure includes extra massage time and they use hot stones!!!!! Definitely one of my new go to spots."}
{"input": "I mean, it's a chain, so it's not particularly exciting to write about. But I was in need of a new battery, and they showed me my options and were honest about what was a good deal. Then, they installed it quickly and disposed of the old one. It was quick and hassle-free which I appreciated. Also, the cashier and the guy who put in the battery were very friendly."}
{"input": "Friendly service, received our food quickly, came by our table several times to check on drinks and our satisfaction with our meals. We will come back here again! Very tasty!"}
{"input": "Visiting from out of town I was excited to visit Chef Milly's newly opened restaurant.  It was a sore DISAPPOINTMENT. Waited even w/a reservation and tried to be patient since they had just recently opened.  Chef Milly does not even offer a smile to his visitors.  The food was just OK and definitely not worth the wait.  I will commend my server (I think his name was Ty) on his professionalism even amongst the multiple jobs he was tasked.  Chef Ramsey would be highly disappointed - I surely was."}
{"input": "I was so excited about this meal, I came home to review it immediately. The service was outstanding and the food I'd say was some of the best in New Orleans. Even the freshly made bread was piping hot and delicious. We started with the oysters good enough, which were four fried oysters with bearnaise sauce and Benton's bacon- a must get. Then we both got scallops and swine with a butternut squash purée and balsamic vinegar. All of the entrees sounded phenomenal, but we both couldn't resist getting that dish. The best part I have to say was the dessert. We got cafe au lait panna cotta with mini glazed donuts, which reminded us of beignets at cafe du monde. Finally, I sampled their house made 'cellos, including ginger and limecellos, and they were unique and delicious. An amazing experience!"}
{"input": "Was in town on business so why not.\n\nThe burger itself was cooked to med-rare perfection the whole patty through, which makes me wonder if they sous-vide it and then give it a quick sear.   The meat itself, while quality, lacked proper seasoning. \n\nFoie gras has absolutely no business adorning a burger that also contains such overwhelming flavors as bleu cheese and bacon.  Or even a burger at all for that matter.  Its ALMOST as dumb as the concept of a kobe burger.  In any event, it's a gimmick thats worked well for this restaurant, to be sure.  I took mine off and ate it separately. It was delicious and i recommend you do the same if you want to taste the extra $12 or so you are spending. \n\nThe deviled eggs were a pass. Nothing you couldn't replicate with google search and an ability to properly boil eggs."}
{"input": "Super friendly staff. General tso pizza is very interesting! Very authentic Taiwanese food! I will stop by very time when I visit Tampa!"}
{"input": "It's great m and my girl just left amc and we were hungry so we were right there close first time trying it we love it spending money there is great we came at the last minute they still served us"}
{"input": "Eh. \n\nVisited Carmine's on a weekend trip to Missouri after reading the its reviews on Yelp. Can't say I had the same experience as other yelpers this time around...\n\nWhile the service was spot-on (I don't think my water glass was ever less than 3/4 full), the quality of food just didn't meet my \"steakhouse\" expectations. My brother had the porterhouse. I tried the seafood special - prawns stuffed with crab and grilled. There really wasn't anything \"special\" about my meal or the risotto it was served with. Both were bland. My bad I suppose for ordering seafood in a restaurant known for steaks, although my brother's medium steak came out practically bleeding and was sent back for a second round on the grill. \n\nOne positive... the toasted ravioli. Yummm! Wish I had just ordered a second plate for dinner."}
{"input": "Great service. Waiter was very knowledgeable. Food was very good had something from all three courses. Cocktails were very good as well."}
{"input": "Please do not go to this place. The food is just horrible. I thought of giving this place a second chance, and I was disappointed again.\nNot that Sitar and New Delhi are great, but they are much much better than Tandoor.\nPlease do not torture your taste buds by going to this place."}
{"input": "Got the cheesecake at the Coffee X change on Tangue Verde.  It was really good.  I heard others talk about the muffins and canolis.  Will def put that on the list for next time."}
{"input": "Drexel/Penn student joint. Good for a quick swing in for take-out or a buffet plate. Nothing to write home about. Reasonable prices and quality."}
{"input": "Just the BEST sandwiches in Tucson. A good variety. Great menu... and it is exciting to see the place is getting a makeover to make getting sandwiches faster and better! A nice neighborhood place. And they deliver! On-line ordering available, but I prefer to call."}
{"input": "Quality of food was terrible. I have had better biriyani from legal sea food! Not authentic in the least. I mean who gives you a side of rice when you order biriyani! Enough said."}
{"input": "Came here on Friday night for happy hour...great prices on drinks but the food was subpar this time. The fried green tomato Blt was very tasty...I will come back for brunch. \n\nDuring winter months sit in the room on the opposite side of the door... Be prepared to wear your coat most of the time."}
{"input": "First time eating here today, was fantastic! The food was great but the REAL REASON to go is view and ambience. Sitting outside right on the beach, enjoying your meal while listening to the soothing sound of waves crashing is simply sublime. Another plus, they sell beer! Lol. A must if you're in the area, even if you're not it's worth the drive. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"input": "I had the fresh red fish and it was amazing.  The atmosphere was great and our server was awesome.  Make sure you get a window seat."}
{"input": "The service was warm and friendly, but not overly cloying. Food wasn't spectacular,  but it was good, a step up from typical pub food. It was satisfying. The atmosphere is very nice, upscale, comfortable and yet stylish."}
{"input": "Stopped in on Monday morning and to my surprise you can order everything except for dinner anytime. I had the beef burger and parm fries that were delicious. The downsides include the very small tables, weird seating arrangements and rock hard seats. I would have given 4 stars if not for the seating situation."}
{"input": "Best meal in New Orleans!!! I was in a group of 4 and we were served by Travis, Susan & Caroline. I had the set price menu: strawberry salad appetiser, chicken entrée & chocolate cake dessert. The salad was fresh and a great start. The chicken is the best chicken I have ever eaten anywhere. It had crispy skin, but was the meat was extremely moist and the corn bread stuffing was superb. The cake was yummy, but very rich. One of our party is vegetarian and she LOVED her vegetable selection plate. The other 2 members had the pork with sweet potato mash and said it was excellent. The staff were wonderful and very attentive. Excellent location and definitely the best meal we had in New Orleans."}
{"input": "Super yummy place!  Easy to miss if you aren't from the area.  We had waffles, scrambled eggs, and a breakfast burrito at our table, and everything was superb.  My son and I had something called the wildflower triple that had scrambled eggs, bacon, and a waffle.  The waffles were very yummy were tender with the perfect golden crisp to them.  The bacon was a great balance of crispy without being over cooked.  \n\nPrices seemed reasonable to me, most items in the $5-8 range if I remember correctly.  Mine was $7.75 I think.\n\nOne last note is that they had good portion sizes.  The portion sizes are filling, without being super sized.  I was afraid when I order something called a triple it would be WAY too much food (even though the price was inline with other items on the menu).  It was two eggs, two pieces of bacon, and a deep pocket waffle the size of a coaster.  If you like huge portions of food look elsewhere."}
{"input": "Leslie and one of her colleagues have cleaned my home twice and I could not be happier.  I live in a 100+ year old home, which creates its own cleaning challenges.  Add to that a recent renovation that has left dust and debris deeply embedded in baseboards, window sills, etc.  These ladies have done two \"deep\" cleans of my home and managed to get rid of all of he built up dust and debris.  I have already hired Leslie to come back every 2 weeks.\n\nI searched for home cleaning services on Yelp and reached to several for quotes.  Leslie was prompt, reasonable and willing to do an initial walk through of my home on a Sunday.\n\nGive Leslie a call, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"input": "Came for the first time today with family and Bailey was excellent, she was friendly and attentive and THE FOOD was incredible. We had the hummus plate (which was very generous portion), the pretzels, mozzarella sticks and caprese salad. Everything was fresh and I was impressed with the food as I had never been here before. We will be back!!"}
{"input": "The flavors continue to surprise me. I had Bananas Foster, Pear Champagne Sorbet, Blueberry Fig Sorbet, and Cassis sorbet. All flavors were good but the Cassis started off quite subtly and then the flavor gradually made itself known; the more I ate of it the better it tasted. It was well worth coming back with another group of friends to sample some frozen happiness."}
{"input": "Brunch was solid. I got the Stack, friends got French Toast w/ Brie cheese. Coffee was good, wait time was minimal and service was great. Highly recommended."}
{"input": "Decent beer selection... that's all I was looking for.  Other than that I try to avoid Mobil's.  QT is more my style."}
{"input": "The good is that these were seriously good burgers--the meat was fresh and the buns were soft and tasty\n\nThe only issues were that I called the order in and it took more than 30 minutes for it to be done--when I got it home, the bacon cheeseburger that I ordered \"plain\" as \"only meat, bread and cheese--no condiments or veggies\" had the mustard spread in the bread.\n\nSo next time I will give them more time to cook and double check the order before I leave--it was really good other than that."}
{"input": "Such a great place to meet and catch-up with friends and colleagues.  Steven is an amazing bartender!  Such great company!"}
{"input": "Came here with a group of girls, so we were able to order a bunch of different things to try.  I gotta say they made the best squid steak I ever had.  Flavor was amazing.  \n\nThe only downside, was that the service was really slow, and everything is extremely over priced.  The food took forever to come out, and we had to wave the waitress down for drinks.\n\nIf we had gotten better service, and the prices not so high, I would have given them 4 stars."}
{"input": "Where to start. The coleslaw was amazing and fresh good fresh crunch. Fries seasoned just right, tartar sauce and the FISH the  fresh, clean, battered perfect and meaty."}
{"input": "Cheu is awesome. The brisket matzo ball pho is unreal and the buns are phenomenal. Go here now."}
{"input": "Had light lunch at an outside table with a friend who was in town.  Basket of chips with mango salsa, fried calamari, and fish tacos.  Everything was excellent, as usual.  Service good, but relaxed."}
{"input": "My friend bought one of the honey lavender cakes for her birthday. I had to ask her where she got it since the sliver I had that night was delicious. Today, I went into Cake Life to get a slice for home. It's a clean, white shop just how I imagine my future kitchen to be and there were amazing cakes and bars and cookies in the case, even Nanaimo bars! I wish I could have gotten more but I had to stick to the cake slice I'd already ordered. About half the tables were occupied with people talking and eating, it's a neighborhood spot. I'm so sad yet so glad it's not closer to my house."}
{"input": "Very disappointing food.  Too bad I cannot give a minus 1 star. The food was just below average and overpriced. I know Good Peruvian food, I also know a bad imitation trying to pass for decent food. The bad service was also another disappointment. Overall this place gives Peruvian Cuisine a bad name. I will never return or recommend this place."}
{"input": "I'm not sure what happened here, but this place went downhill fast. I just had a pizza steak and chicken parm sandwich that were a step above edible. Seriously, I'm still trying to get the taste of the pizza steak out of my mouth. The only thing worse than being excited for a steak sandwich and having it suck is being excited for wings and having them forget to send the damn blue cheese!! Really?? Come on! I can honestly say that based On this experience, I would never go back. \n\nFirst review: Great food and friendly service. We had an Italian hoagie, and cheesesteak hoagie, and hot wings. All we're fantastic. The rolls are soft and fresh. They were full of delicious meat. The wings were large and the hot sauce is the best I've had in the area. I'll be back for sure."}
{"input": "Village Whiskey's burgers are PHENOMENAL!  Always cooked to perfection (medium rare for me!).  It's like a religious expeirence eating these things.  Went with my boyfriend there on our first date last summer and he's been addicted ever since...as are my sister, all of my friends, and coworkers!  I haven't met one person who doesn't love them.\n\nI'm a former vegetarian who cannot believe I was missing out on these burgers for 4 years.  I am now MORE than making up for that time lost! :)"}
{"input": "Fantastic place to get donuts, and their prices are amazing. This is definitely my go to place when I'm craving donuts."}
{"input": "This is one of my new favorite summer, weekend traditions! They have several tables outside and facing the Monon where\nI can bring my dogs and have an AWESOME breakfast! \n\nFirst, and I can't say enough, how much I love dog-friendly places and they are! They will bring my dogs water and they ask about them. Speaking of friendly, the staff is great! Staff is friendly, nice, responsive, get my order correct everytime, and they suggest new things if I'm indecisive! \n\nMy current favorite thing is the Huevos rancheros with ranchera sauce with is a little spicy, but when I couldn't decide between the lovely or ranchera sauce, they let me sample the sauces! Great customer service!\n\nTheir flavored iced coffees are also pretty and very good.\n\nI highly recommend this place!"}
{"input": "It can be tough to grab a bite to eat during \"after bar\" hours but Barbarians at least takes care of guests who aren't looking to be puked and/or hit on.  Specialty pizzas (si se Salsipuedes!) are worth the line at the counter.  Wish the obnoxious guys in front of us had just left before the manager had to make them (thank you!).  Tasty pizza still made up for it.  Oh!  and how does a pizza parlor have a better wine list than \"the club?!\""}
{"input": "I cannot say enough good things about this place. It is consistently fabulous from start to finish. Intimate atmosphere, delicious cocktails, impeccable service, and amazing food every time. I recommend this place to everyone. Its easily one of my favorite restaurants in the city!"}
{"input": "Not bad with the crawfish dish. Really laid back during the day but after 6 forget me being there. U become a number"}
{"input": "Amazing hidden gem. This store is too little but have full of valuable things. So much fun to check out all different kinds spices, teas and snacks. \n\nAnd their coffee.... Hazelnut coffee is amazing!!!! I drink a lot of coffee but I like to drink decaf. It is really hard to find good decaf but I found one in Philly. Their hazelnut coffee is so aromatic, just brewing at home made you feel good. I got like more than 10 packages so far and loving them. \n\nAlso got bunch of spices. Cumin, wasabi powder, paprika, anise, rosemary, red and white pepper... Just make it. They have all. \n\nThe owner lady doesn't speak much initially but once she recognize your face, she is the sweetest. So helpful and get chatty. I had So much  fun talking to her and looking forward going back there once weather get warm!"}
{"input": "Possibly the best breakfast sandwich EVER.  On a biscuit!  Oh my gosh, it was so good!"}
{"input": "I recently visited Indique's boutique on South Street & the customer service was top notch. They made me feel comfortable to ask them a million questions since I'm not very familiar with extensions. I've never found hair that will work well with my natural texture. This hair is so beautiful that I'm having a tough time deciding on which to install first - organic curl or the Bounce blow out. Either way, I will be using Indique's hair extensions exclusively going forward!"}
{"input": "Krystal is awesome. I walked in at the right time.  Reasonable rates. Clean! Friendly. Good hygiene practices.  Tech wears gloves. No razors but she use of battery powered sander for the heel and other callouses and  tough places.   Good massage technique on the feet.  Nice use of lotions.  Plenty of parking in the strip mall.  No fuss.  They work to meet your needs.  Everything is a la cart so the costs add up but service and final product was well worth it.  My feet are ready for the Puerto Rico beaches. I just pulled off of 130 South because I saw their neon sign and boy am I glad I did!  I wouldn't change a thing!"}
{"input": "Best Donair really does have good donairs.  I wouldn't day BEST but pretty darn good.  The first time I ate here, the man behind the counter talked on his cell phone the entire I was in there!  Even while he made my food!  Despite this annoyance, I returned to Best Donair because the donair I had was delicious.  My second experience was much better - no cell phone.  And both times I ate there, the amount of meat in my donair was monumental!  I have to admit, as an avid donair eater, I was completely shocked at the amount of meat they gave me (but perhaps that is where the name Best Donair derives from).  They also have ice cream for a sweet treat after your meal - if there's room!"}
{"input": "This theater is dated but you can't beat the cheap prices.  Staff is always very friendly and that alone keeps me dividing my time between here and the Loft.  It is never even close to being crowded and you can always see any of the major movies on top of lots of Indie films they show here and hardly anywhere else.  I would much rather wait out a movie til it comes here."}
{"input": "I've been wanting to try Trust Me BBQ for over a year now.  I stopped in there about 3 months ago and waited in line for 10 minutes with no service and left.  After reading reviews, I figured I'd give it a chance again just to see what all the fuss is about.  The food was 50/50 but the service was horrible so I'll likely never return.  The gentleman behind the counter didn't speak, smile or engage with us at all, I felt like I was at a vending machine.  Once we finally ordered, he didn't even listen to the order and put the wrong sides in our meals, we had to correct him while he was serving.  All in all, I will just stick with Down to the Bone BBQ\n\nPros:  BBQ Sauce is delicious, macaroni salad was different and interesting, \"pulled\" pork was moist.\n\nCons:  Chicken was more dry than a sheet of paper, inedible even with the BBQ Sauce.  Mac & Cheese was served from a pan that has probably been on the steam table for 2-3 days.  Collard Greens were very mildly flavored."}
{"input": "Wife and I both got the strip. Very very good steak. Great seasoning.  The au gratin potatoes were a little rich but a great addition. Ask them to add grilled onions to your steak. excellent. If you are looking for a good steak try Stoney River."}
{"input": "It was cheap. Course was nice enough. Great set of rental ping clubs. Friendly staff!"}
{"input": "A truly delightful find! This is the transformed Carrow's Restaurant on Plumb and Kietzke that was saved by the wrecking ball by its beautiful redwood beams and fascia. The food was fantastic. My wife had the tri-tip salad -- greens on one side of the plate with a balsamic vinagrette balanced by four good-sized slices of medium-rare tri-tip and potato \"croutons\" --\nlittle heavenly bits of crunchy potatoes. I had the tri/tip/chicken combo, selecting the fresh corn salad and potato salad as my two sides. It was so good that we ordered dessert as well (not something I do regularly). The offering was lemon meringue, mudd pie, apple pie, and ice cream. We shared the first -- again delicious, with real, perfectly set and browned meringue. The prices were very reasonable for the quality of food and the experience. We've already recommended to family and friends locally, and expect to return soon. Well done!"}
{"input": "Went here with my boyfriend and we loved it!\nOld school feeling, with 3 floors!!\n\nWe have been here twice, and each time was great!\nThe food was amazing, I got the veal since it had been recommended to me, as well as the clams casino, mussles, pasta with oil and garlic, and the home-made garlic bread. Staff was nice and helpful!\n\n...Went here again recently while in the area and had this new dish of gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce in it, and it was delicious!!!!! My new favorite dish as this place. \n\nMUST EAT!!!"}
{"input": "We love, love M.L. Rose! I am a huge beer fan and the flights are so fun to choose and try. I love the neighborhood hangout feel, not too hipster, not too old....just right! We always have awesome service too. My hang up can be the food. Wings not quite crispy enough, burgers not cooked to taste, spinach artichoke dip just meh. The steak and Gouda was flat out gross - big fatty slab of undercooked steak on bread. We were told it is leaving the menu, but they should have removed it long ago. And no visit from the manager when the sandwich was returned, which was a little underwhelming. We will be back, we are big fans, but please get your kitchen together so I can have my fav burger in town cooked just right :-)"}
{"input": "This is an outstanding Italian market\nFriendly staff \nTakes me back to childhood days and all the Italian markets I shopped at with my grandparents \nVery old world \nLots of goodies to find \nmany rooms filled with Italian culture \nThey offer 1 gluten free pastry at the bakery counter it's a chocolate moose cake out standing \nNo gluten free pizza which is sad and I hope they change soon !!\nThere were prepackaged cookies and gluten free Italian items to be found \nIt was my first visit, I am planning a second very soon"}
{"input": "Service is often hit or miss, but the tacos and drinks are both excellent. The best Mexican in St. Pete. Sit outside because the atmosphere is really nice. The bands that play usually aren't very good but overall it's a great place."}
{"input": "The cauliflower pizza is the BEST. We will be back again & again to get some pre made protein packs  and look around for more healthy and delish goodies. Loved the cauliflower sandwich too, Great place!"}
{"input": "This is my family's go to when we eat out for Chinese. The place is not big but it's decently modern. The quantity and the quality of their food are always good. Some items on the menu might be a little pricy, but most of the items off their menu are worth the money. One only improvement I can see is maybe they should hire a couple more staff during rush hours at dinner, food can come out a little late sometimes and the staff looks overwhelmed all the time, we've had the server forgetting a dish we ordered before because they were so busy. Nevertheless, this is a great spot and by far the best Chinese food restaurant in the area."}
{"input": "Awesome brunch. About $35 for unlimited mimosas and Buffett. Buffett is on point with a full seafood bar (ahi tuna, crab legs, peel-n-eat shrimp, smoked salmon and more). Limited tapas style menu to order even more goodies from. I recommend you order the bananas foster over the Belgian waffles off the tapas menu: phenomenal!  And if the food and drinks don't sell you, the view and service should. Dining room has windows lining the back wall so you have a stellar view of the bay while you're dining. Our server, Jade was superb. I don't think my mimosa glass was ever empty!"}
{"input": "This restaurant has been holding a spot on my bookmark list for quite some time. We were pleasantly surprised to find a lunch buffet here on a recent Friday afternoon visit. \n\nThe lighting and high ceilings are *different* but I can happily see past them for the chicken tikka, palak paneer and Chana masala. The buffet rice was on the dry side but for $7.99, I'm not complaining too much."}
{"input": "Food was good but service was poor. Very unorganized and not handling crowd well. Not enough seating outside and indoor temperature is  too cold. Condensation from air vents kept dripping in me. Lemonade tasted like a cool aide mix.. Surprised people were not enjoying the beach chairs un the sand."}
{"input": "J's Seafood Dock was not busy, quick to take our order, and had plenty of seating. \n\nThe jambalaya was really flavorful with just the right amount of heat, but very short on andouille and chicken. It had no shrimp in it at all. \n\n'Real Creole Shrimp Tacos' were more like real creole lettuce tacos. Maybe we should have known because the sample did not have a lot of shrimp so we ordered at our own risk. Flavorful sauce and tasty tortillas though."}
{"input": "Went there due to having a gc, and was suprised at the great food!  Had the sauteed stirfry over spinach, and my gf had the abundant pile of nachos.  They have a pretty decent selection of other delectables, and the day time bartender was very pleasant.  I would recommend to someone who wants a friendly atmosphere with decent food in a sports bar setting.  They actually do have sports playing on the tvs."}
{"input": "Wow. Wow. We've been trying to go here for a while and for some reason or another it hasn't happened. We used our access card and walked there last night and I must say this is one of the best meals I've had in awhile. For Italian food..... the best I've had forever which is a long time. We will be coming back. Deep fried ravioli appetizer. We had chicken alfredo and eggplant Parmesan for entrees. She ordered a glass of wine that was $10 that we did realize we could buy the bottle for $11 later. Which is fine I understand. When we come back we will be served by Mario because he is the best."}
{"input": "This in my go to sushi place in center city. The food is always fresh and tastes good. My go to is the Kano crunch house special roll. It comes covered in spicy mayo and crunchy caviar on top. I recently discovered the ak-47 roll which comes with shrimp tempura, cream cheese, avocado, and a special soy paper on the outside. It's very good as well. For appetizer I love the rock shrimp which is covered in a sauce similar to spicy mayo and drizzled in soy sauce, it is crunchy and amazing. The California roll I would say is pretty standard compared to other places. They also offer a lunch special on weekdays!"}
{"input": "There are some days when you are so desperate for a cup of coffee that you will pay a fortune. So imagine my surprise on one of these days when the total for a cup of large coffee landed me less than three bucks in, of all places, Clayton. I had heard some mixed reviews about this small chain and I decided to give it a go since I was in the area. I honestly have tasted better, and the buzz I got didn't last very long for a large. And on top of that, I didn't get the best service during the 2 or 3 minutes I was in the shop. Hmm..."}
{"input": "One of my favorite spots to swing by while in the Ybor area, either with a group of friends or alone, as they do have a lot of space to bring out your laptop to work or read.\n\nSince I usually come during the workday for lunch, I'm a big fan of their specialty coffee drinks. They have a very unique one - espresso lemonade - which I got to try on my last visit. The bitterness was cancelled out by the lemonade and it was delicious.\n\nThe Bricks has a good choice of apps/salads/sandwiches and I also tried a spicy chorizo, creamed soup, which my server recommended, and he was right-on point with this pick.\n\nIf you're in Ybor please make sure you stop by here...it's vegan/vegetarian friendly and just has a good all-around vibe inside."}
{"input": "I loves me some TJ's!!! Just an overall comment I'm sure everyone knows, don't fall in love with any product you buy at a TJ's, because they may discontinue it without warning. This location has the same great friendly service I've come to enjoy from all TJ's. And the food's good too!\n\nBEER!"}
{"input": "I highly recommend Elika's Prenatal Yoga class at Then Comes Baby. \n\nThen Comes Baby is clean, inviting and cozy. They have everything you need for a yoga class - mats, blankets, blocks, etc. so you don't have to bring any supplies with you, and everything is kept very clean. I like that you can sign up for classes online, and also they allow you to do make-up classes.\n\nThe 6 week prenatal yoga series was one of the things I looked forward to weekly throughout my pregnancy. As a teacher Elika is incredibly encouraging and informative. I love that each week had some sort of theme that resonated with pregnancy. At the end of the series we had a small party and a new mama would come back and share their birth story. It was such a great experience, I would recommend this class at Then Comes Baby to any first-time (or repeat) mothers to be!"}
{"input": "I absolutely loved this. We parked at opry mills near the movie theatre and just walked over. It was seriously impressive and worth all the hassle of the ridiculous traffic. So fancy inside and so many great photo ops! Definitely go on your visit to Nashville!"}
{"input": "Ordered the coconut curry ramen and it was so delicious. The broth was extremely flavorful, and savory. Party in my mouth!"}
{"input": "We paid $230 per night for our stay during the Memorial Weekend and man how I wish I stayed at Motel 6 at next door instead. The location is prime - walkable to tons of cute little restaurant and even Whole Foods. However, the room was way too shabby - we can hear very loud TV noise from our neighbor rooms clearly; no mini fridge; the arrangement of furnitures was disfunctioning; only two table lamps in the entire room, including one doesn't even work, and the dark light makes the room more creepy.. The breakfast was similar quality to their room - very limited choice and low quality GMO products.  You probably can understand my disappointment knowing the price I paid now!"}
{"input": "My boyfriend and I stayed at the Hotel Monaco over Labor Day Weekend while we attended a wedding in the city. \n\nI was impressed with the customer service and the quality of the accommodations immediately. The valet opened my car doors, assisted us with locating the front desk and were quick to bring the car back when we needed it. \n\nOur room was ready, clean and beautiful! The front desk was quick to answer our questions and help us with anything we needed. \n\nOne of my favorite amenities offered by Kimpton hotels are the bike rentals. We didn't have time to take advantage of this, but I wish we could have!"}
{"input": "I LOVE coming here after work. It's honestly the only burger place I approve of thats in the city. Its way better and way bigger burgers than shake shack. I absolutely recommend the up side burger it's definitely worth the money and if you have spare change absolutely get original fries and a fountain soda. They have berch beer !!!  and orange cream !!"}
{"input": "I love this place. Gourmet breakfast/brunch fare at not too high prices. The bloody Mary should be on a magazine cover."}
{"input": "Love!! Our new favorite local spot. We've gone a few times since they opened and it's always a good ambiance, and great food. The drinks are great, the salsa is super yummy, and the salads are very much entree sized. Bring your friends, sit outside, grab a margarita and enjoy!"}
{"input": "Extremely overpriced for second hand. Staff is snooty and judgmental. I rarely find things here that are worth the price. They don't get new things very often also. The only thing I got that was worthwhile from here was a mirror a MIRROR. Not even a piece of clothing"}
{"input": "The hazelnut sponge cake is the best around. Def worth the price and its always fresh."}
{"input": "nice cozy place offering good cocktails...I wanted to try out the few of their single malt scotch, and bartender was very helpful and he poured little ounces of scotch on the glass and let me try out before ordering a full glass.   i will definitely hit up this place again, when i'm hanging out at northern liberties"}
{"input": "This franchise is fabulous. Sharon has a great little group of friendly employees, makes the most delicious salads and totally caters to her customers. They also have soups, sandwiches, wraps and other light fare. So many choices to choose from to create your own signature salad!\nI have tons of food sensitivities, and Sharon actually shows me the labeled ingredients of anything I'm not sure of, like the pita chips, so we are certain I will have a truly nourishing meal. \nThe brown basmati rice is to die for. I hear the Thai soup is totally rocking! \nThe perfect place for fresh ingredients, outstanding service and a truly caring staff. So highly recommend this place! I just polished off my mixed salad so fast I didn't have time to take a photo! Yummmmmm."}
{"input": "Great bar, wonderful ambience, fantastic cocktails."}
{"input": "I have rented a few units throughout the years & have always had a great experience. The staff is always very helpful & friendly, the facility is always clean, I've never had an issue with security, & the autpoay is helpful & convenient. I mostly deal directly with Stacy & she's awesome! I would highly recommend this place & will continue to do business with this facility."}
{"input": "Well my boyfriend and I gave Cheddars a second chance recently, because the time before we had awful service. The food has always been pretty good and that's why we choose to go back. We had great service this time and the drinks and food were great!! The only complaint I would have is that we ordered an appetizer and barely had the chance to eat any of it before our dinner came out. We were still charged for the appetizer. All and all its reasonable and family friendly place to go!"}
{"input": "Terrible mixed drinks. Our table got four different drinks and no on like their drink. I got the desert highball and it smelled like the fruit mix was spoiled. On top of that it was just bland, totally watered down."}
{"input": "I really enjoyed this hip pizza shop. The atmosphere was great. Hip hop was jamming in the background so we at the community tables could have great conversation. The wait staff was very knowledgeable and just wanted to customer to have a fabulous experience. Local beer, wine on tap, and delicious pizza. We ordered the prosciutto pie and Nutella dessert pie! Yum"}
{"input": "Amazeballs! Don't listen to the haters, get the chicken or Carne tacos. You will not be disappointed. Oh and try it with their hot sauce=WIN."}
{"input": "Wonderful experience both times. It can get really busy for dinner but the wait isn't that long. Our lovely waitress gave us free gumbo because we waited a few minutes for her to take our order and man was it good. My favorite has been the crawfish étouffée. But oysters looked awesome too! Can't wait to come back and eat our bread pudding. It was so good that I am reviewing before we are done."}
{"input": "I would give this place zero stars if I could. The bouncer told me I couldn't leave until I gave him a \"little somethin somethin\" and took away my friend's legal ID. When we asked for it back, he said he wouldn't give it back until the cops came. What a fucking joke. Save your self esteems and your personal property and go somewhere else."}
{"input": "my food was not as I ordered it and the manager was quick to assist me and make it right, I appreciate that so much, and Katrina who works at the Cheesecake counter is always nice!!!!!!!"}
{"input": "This place is NASTY! . Floors, booths, sides of booths are caked with old food. Service was slow at best. Baked potato tasted like it had been baked 3 days ago. Will NEVER go there again."}
{"input": "My hair is a work in progress. I have been trying to get an A-line bob for a bit over a year now with little success until today! Jenna Moore was referred by a friend and on my god I'm so glad she did. Jenna is amazing. She listen to everything I had to say and told me what she was going to do to make sure we were both on the same page. Not only did she listen but she delivered too! I know my hair needs some healing, Jenna doing the healing, and growing to get where I want to be but I actually see it in the future now thanks to Jenna. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"}
{"input": "This will go down in history as one of my best dining experiences worldwide. The locations, the ambience, the service, the food..everything was top notch. The view of the water is breath taking, especially at sunset. I had the crusted scallops for dinner and they were delicious! My husband had the grouper and loved it too. For desert, we shared a crime brûlée which came lit on fire! Everything was exceptional!"}
{"input": "This place has the most amazing chicken donairs in the city. Seriously. Amazing.\nThe issue is that they only seem to have them available about 60% of the times i go in. And since it's the only reason i go, i'm often disappointed. Frustrating and sad because i really do love their food."}
{"input": "The court house is very old and the art is great. The spiral staircase is funny. One can get view of entire city from 5th level. The tower clock room is really surprising with all mechanical gears inside!! You need a prior appointment to get into clock room. Worth spending 2 to 3 hours of time here."}
{"input": "Outstanding service, food and drinks.  The Mojitos, Cava Martinis and Espresso Martini are unbelievable.   The food is beautifully prepared and delicious!  The prices are so reasonable and the staff will do anything to make your experience perfect.\nThe food is definitely a blend of Spanish, Mexican and other Latin American cuisines.\nOn our trip to Mussel Shoals we made the drive to Cava twice.   Bravísimo!"}
{"input": "Raving review from Californian outsider!\n\nI came by for lunch during one of the many crowded conferences I'm sure St. Louis gets (holler, Urbana12!). My friend and I found seats at the bar as others were clearing out (got kind of lucky there), and our server was a delightfully facial haired man who walked us through menu selections and sassed me like we were best friends.\n\nI'm kind of a cheapo, so the pricey burgers were at first a turn off, but I had heard very good things about their specialty burgers from other friends. I helped myself to the basic burger, which I asked for cooked all the way, and was pleasantly not dry at all. You know what else was delightful? Their homemade ketchup! Perfectly sweet and perfectly ketchupy.\n\nThe order did take a bit longer to come out than I would have liked, but watching my sassy non-robot server make lots of different drinks for other customers ameliorated the pain of the wait. Thanks Bailey's Range, I'll miss you forever."}
{"input": "Came here for dinner with local and out of town friends. Service was great and food was even better! I had the chargrilled oysters, seafood beignet, and blackberry jalapeño ribs. Washed it all down with a couple of Abita grapefruit. Highly recommend the seafood beignet!"}
{"input": "walked by here and decided to go in to eat bc supposedly best crepes in town. I got a savory crepe with ham, mushrooms, Swiss, and some creamy sauce inside. it was very crispy, which is what I look for when deciding whether a crepe is good (I've had plenty of crepes in the past that were not crispy). we also got one called \"el gitano\" which had bacon, tomato, mozz, and basil inside. overall the food itself was good, but the ambience was a little lacking bc of the emptiness. woulda tasted better psychologically if it was a bustling restaurant, esp since we were there for brunch. servers were very French and polite."}
{"input": "Chick-fil-A ....first time here.\nI had a very good experience there very good service as well. food delicious..very yummy,the employees very nice they make me feel special ...don't even think to go to chick- fil-A  just go you won't regret...promise!!!!---"}
{"input": "This place deserves a special mention.. it's not really on the heart of the city (for tourists), but it's definitely a place you should mark down for one brunch at least...shrimp n grits are hands down the best we've had in the city....the juices were fresh... and for a person who has a hard time eating Omelettes, Surrey's has converted me for sure.. the lump crab omelette with the sauce was just the cure for a dull grey rainy morning...! Word of caution-the place is always full, so make sure you get there at least 30 mins before you really want to eat, just to make sure you don't starve over the delish smells that keep on wafting out"}
{"input": "I'm a wing-lover, so I decided to eat here recently. In short, the wings were fine; nothing special, nothing bad or great. O! Wing Plus is a bit different from all the others. The wings are fried, and then soaked in sauce. To me, I wouldn't even call it sauce on most of them. It was more like oil, grease or the like. They didn't taste too bad. The parmesan wings didn't taste as good as they looked, but it was so-so for me. On my three visits there, I had the ten wings combo (with fries and drink). The supposedly hot wings weren't as spicy (sorry guys I've had better...). The crinkle cut fries were alright as well. I did use them to dip into the leftover wing sauce on the plate. Which brings me to a point: this is probably the first wing place that I visited that doesn't offer dipping sauce (like ranch and blue-cheese). But I got by. Plus I had the blasting Top 40 music to keep me less bored. All in all, it was A-OK."}
{"input": "The food was good but our service was terrible.  Our server, Ernie, never came back to our table after we got our food until she brought the check.  My hamburger, ordered rare, came out medium.  When she brought the check and asked what our food was I showed her the hamburger and said it's not how I ordered it. She agreed and stated someone else must've gotten the rare one that I ordered. Both of our drinks were empty but she had never come back to ask if we wanted more to drink. She did ask that when she brought the check and we replied we would've liked more to drink previously but now we were done.  We asked for a box for our leftovers that it took her three more trips by our table to remember to bring it to us. She saw the bill and our credit card sitting on the table but never told us we had to go upfront to pay.  I was very disappointed and will not go back."}
{"input": "I went here for the first time this week and loved it! It was fast, reasonably priced, and my brows look much better"}
{"input": "Took my 12 year old son yesterday for a cut, walked in-sat right down. Beca cut him, and she was spectacular. She recognized what the previous barber did last time he got a cut and offered suggestions on what she can do to correct his cowlick. Gave him a sharp curved part and perfect shape up of the sides, asked our opinions before doing anything (huge because he won't speak up if he's unhappy with what someone's doing in fear of hurting their feelings). The other barbers chairs were all full, every single client was happy and laughing, the entire atmosphere was relaxed and laid back, and the barbers themselves were clean and happy. You can tell the barbers love their job and respect the company they work for, and that's a huge deal."}
{"input": "In Philly for the weekend and stumbled onto Jones on the way to our hotel.  Food is all-american comfort food.  Almost everything was excellent.  I thought the mac n' cheese was blah.  And the perogies were nothing above average at best.  Two turkey burgers, the chicken and waffles and the meatloaf all got two thumbs up.  Desserts were fantastic.  A couple in our group were dissapointed they still didn't have the donuts in the menu (but that could have been two years ago), but the chocolate chip bread pudding and the key lime pie were write home about good.  Drinks menu was full of house specialties, though we mostly stuck to the beer menu.\n\nService was average.  Seemed quick to take away our plates, and never there when you needed another drink.\n\nI will stop just short of calling Jones kid friendly, but they took four adults, two infants under 6 months and a 4 year old without a reservation without questions and were very accomodating.  Granted we were there at 5:30.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed."}
{"input": "Pretty slow service and the waitresses aren't very kind. I guess I was expecting something different at a diner with high ratings but I understand it's in the middle of a tourist area. However, service should be a priority. Something that really bothered me was how much trash was left on the floor of the outside deck- it all has the potential to blow right into the ocean. NOT OKAY. I had to stand up several times to grab straw wrappers and napkins before they blew into the water. If you're going to have a waterfront/beach front business, be responsible about it. It would be a very easy fix-just a screen on the bottom of the fence. The food was good but I won't be back."}
{"input": "We held our year end Holiday Party for our firm here this year.  The service is impeccable and the food is amazing.  The restaurant was closed to the public for our private event.   Tara was wonderful to work with as our party planner, working closely with us to customize our menu and provide our own entertainment.   The entire staff was very attentive and assisted us in setting up our little bar area (this is a BYOB).   We couldn't have been more pleased with the atmosphere, food and service.  We highly recommend the Silverspoon and can't wait to return again!"}
{"input": "Simply put, the Grypon Cafe makes me feel infinite.  It's about two minutes away from the Wayne Starbucks, but believe me when I say that all the cool informed coffee connoisseurs flock to Gryphon Cafe.  Its setting is quiet and intimate.It exudes a chill and serene vibe, from its very dim lighting and small (in a good way!) space.  The lattes are very good- made with strong espresso.  In addition, it provides various baked goods, although I've had a really dry, stale brownie from there (A big no-no! As a result, I don't care too much for the baked goods).  In addition, Gryphon supports a lively local music scene; music begins at 9 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays."}
{"input": "I know everyone raves about this place but the chicken biscuit was pretty gross. The chicken was undercooked and slimy and I couldn't finish it. I would not go back."}
{"input": "We've gone to several different vets at Kirkwood Animal Hospital over the years and you honestly can't go wrong.  We currently see Dr. Hormuth and couldn't give a more glowing recommendation, she loves our dog and he loves her.  To put it in to perspective: My dog, Cooper, legitimately gets excited if I say we're going to the vet."}
{"input": "Great lunch specials for $6 or $7, entree soup and rice. Lots of variety for dinner with most entrees under $12. The food is excellent. Service is attentive. The restaurant is clean, modern, very pleasant. Enthusiastically recommended."}
{"input": "Not a bad place to try out some authentic Taiwanese cuisine. Service could be better and parking situation also needs improvement!"}
{"input": "I finally got to try them. Wow..they did a great job with the remodle. I loved the mushroom cheese steak"}
{"input": "I don't know why this place got lower ratings! It is amazing! Food is flavorful. Some of the best Thai food I've ever had. The staff is friendly and the food comes out fast and hot. The fried rice is excellent and so is the green curry. Worth a stop in!"}
{"input": "I have been coming to the Siam elephant for several years and without question it has become one of the best Thai food restaurants anywhere.\n\nThe service is excellent, but far more importantly the quality of the food is simply superb.\n\nTake the time to enjoy this amazing restaurant in Carpinteria :-)"}
{"input": "Ahh, my not so secret  love affair with cupcakes deepens with my experience at Jimmies Cupcake truck. Stopping at one? I would LOVE to see you try my darling. \n\nThe day I came upon this truck I was all about some cupcakes and they had a pretty amazing variety. I was torn but not for long. I started at their James Bond (red velvet) cupcake and was immersed in a moist and creamy cupcake heaven. Just the right amount of sweetness for the frosting and the cupcakes were not too dense and not too light. It was perfection. I took out the cookies and cream cupcake next. The little Oreo cookies in the cupcake batter...genius. The frosting tasted JUST like Oreo filling and I was taken back to my childhood. I finished off with a menue special - apple cake cupcake. It was buttery, cinnomon-y (what?) and all the things that taste like Fall. Hallelujah! \n\nMy only regret that day was that I could not eat any more."}
{"input": "Always great food and exceptional service!! I enjoy the food- well prepared and delicious. One of my favorite sushi restaurants. They have a generous appetizer menu and plenty of long rolls and hand rolls from which to choose. The sushi chefs and staff are always friendly and attentive. Food is always fresh and delightful."}
{"input": "Our first time here thanks to Groupon and everything was A okay! All the employees were friendly and polite! The guys were really quick in diagnosing and repairing my husbands AC in his truck! I will be returning and recommending all my friends to this place! You guys were awesome!"}
{"input": "Excellent beef fajitas!  All the sides were excellent, the drinks were perfect, service was friendly and fast, kid friendly, and great atmosphere.  Best Mexican food I have had in a long time."}
{"input": "We have driven by this place so many times looking for good sushi, but the building isn't so welcoming. We finally decided to give it a try tonight based on other yelp reviews and were very pleased we did. Everything was delicious. I think this will be our place of choice for sushi now."}
{"input": "I can't believe I have never written a review for Salon Fiber! Well here goes, long overdue! I absolutely LOVE this salon and my hair stylist Lindsey! She just gets me and totally does a AMAZING job every single time! She has turned this plain Jane into not so plain anymore and I receive the best compliments on my hair thanks to her!! I go every 6 weeks to keep my hair healthy and book my appointments always in advance! I started going to this salon about two years ago because I got married in Phoenixville so I wanted a close by hairstylist for the big day so we could all walk from there to my venue. Who knew I would fall so in love with Lindsey and all girls there that I refuse to go anywhere else!! I highly highly recommend Salon Fiber to everyone! All the girls there do a amazing job! My family, friends and coworkers all go there now!! All great things to say!! Thank you all for always being so amazing and making my salon days perfect!!"}
{"input": "I absolutely love EVAN he's the best guy ever. If he wasn't the door guy I don't know what people would do with themselves!!! He is one of the most awesome\nPeople that I Know !!! If It wasn't for Evan I probably wouldn't come to OMALLZ"}
{"input": "I've been a few times, usually with colleagues from the Science Center in the same building. I know this place has fans, but I just don't get it. It just seems like fairly average, overpriced Americanized Chinese food that is perhaps a bit spicier than usual. The have a nice bar if you want to hang out with friends."}
{"input": "never get take-out from this place ever unless you want to eat your lunch at dinner time.  Not only did it take almost 2 hours to get the food delivered but we were told a half an hour after we placed the order that it was on the grill(he called back because of credit card issues.)  I will never get anything from this place again."}
{"input": "It was great.  I had crab Benedict. Just the kind of place i was looking for. Paud parking on the street was easy to find."}
{"input": "These guys are nothing short of AMAZING!! Tom is not only fun, he's effective and calm - moving can be stressful, but not if the Sultans are involved! Tom's team went above and beyond the call of duty to make my move stress-free - If you are planning a move, do yourself a favor and hire the Sultans of Schlep!!"}
{"input": "I went here for the first time on Friday with my wife and kids. From start to finish the service was quick and friendly. The food was the best Italian food I have had in a while. They started us out with delicious bread. We ordered the spicy chicken flat bread. The bread was very spicy but definitely good. I ordered the eggplant Parmesan and my wife ordered the monte rosena chicken dish with mashed potatoes instead of pasta. Most definitely the creamiest mashed potatoes I ever tasted. My egg plant parm was perfect. I will definitely go back to this restaurant again."}
{"input": "Great place for wings and the staff is excellent. The owner takes great pride in what he serves and realy put his best foot foward"}
{"input": "I deducted one star because the service was not great. Our waiter wasn't friendly at all. The first question was \"soup or salad \". I wanted to order appetizer and lunch special, but he assumed we were having lunch. Seaweed salad was really good. Shiomay was small but good. The sashimi was fresh. Banzai roll was great and unique. Raw salmon and white fish with avocado and fish egg wrapped in cucumber with some sweet sauce. Perfect for those who is looking for no-rice roll. Salad dressing was more like carrot purée."}
{"input": "Overall, a Great Experience!!! My wife and I celebrating our 5 year Anniversary and had a Fantastic time. Not just the Food was off the hook, but the wait staff was very attentive. And what can I say about the views. Thank you guys for making our night memorable."}
{"input": "Such great customer service!! I was only there for a few minutes to get some food, but the workers were very very friendly and left a good impression on me!"}
{"input": "The restaurant itself is beautifully crafted and decorated. The elegant ambience sets the mood and as a tough critic...I love it! The food is not rushed and it's delectable taste gave me a memory I will never forget. Service is fast and server was extremely polite .Amazing & awesome food experience !!"}
{"input": "Awesome! Hurricanes will blow you away! Quick service! Etoufee is terrific...Authentic New Orleans cuisine. Always ask for Shirley - she's surely the best!!!! Ooo! Rah!"}
{"input": "Was in town looking for breakfast places and this place had a super high rating.  I'm pretty picky when it comes to ordering biscuits and gravy because I like the way I make them.  Lots of sausage in the gravy and a bit of pepper.  I gave it a try.  The sausage gravy was very tasty as was the orange juice.  I didn't enjoy the biscuits.  They were very hard and smothering them in gravy didn't help much.  I also thought this place deserved more than one dollar sign.  It was a bit pricy.  All in all, pretty good."}
{"input": "Staff is amazing here.  So helpful and supportive when we stayed in 2015.  They knew we had a lot of stuff to load in our car, plus two little kids, so they let us take our time.  We were way past the checkout hour by the time we left, lol!  Hotel room was always clean, house keeping always prompt.   They left the room neat as a pin.  The breakfast had a lot of variety, including beverages.  The breakfast area was nice to sit and relax in.  The hotel itself is beautiful.  You could tell the staff paid attention to cleanliness and detail.  Only thing I was kind of put off by was that the bathroom and shower room didn't have locks, but that was a minor issue.  I don't give five stars easily, lol, so I would definitely recommend this hotel!"}
{"input": "Just got a pizza to go and ate it the whole way home  Best pizza ever for real everything was so fresh  I went to the new store at Main Street of Exton  very clean place and seriously the best pizza i have had in a long time got all the toppings i love and more I would highly recommend trying it so worth it   I will be back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, I wanted to add my picture but i couldn't do it  by the time i got home i only had one piece left....LOL"}
{"input": "We went to dinner on a Friday night about 6:30. We'd called ahead and made a reservation not knowing if it would be busy or not. We walked in and were greeted right away. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. They brought us hot towels to freshen up. All we ordered was sushi and it came out very quickly. The Vegas Roll was IMO the best one. I also recommend the Caterpillar roll. I think the overall value was really good for our party of 6. We even got dessert afterwards. Reasonably priced.  We'd defintely go back again"}
{"input": "The food was spectacular! I got a crawfish omelet special that had avocado and brie in it!  The juice was really overpriced ($5.75 for a 12 oz glass) and honestly nothing special.  Overall, the most delicious and most expensive breakfast I've ever had"}
{"input": "Steamed buns for the adults. Beef & Broccoli for the kids. Great service. Good for kids. Food holds up if you opt to take out. Our favorite to go spot."}
{"input": "Very bad service and i took one month for rent, so they charged different types of taxes and extra fees. Finally they charge for tolls but all the tolls i only paid I didn't use ezpass. Budget is the worst rental service and i took car from different place"}
{"input": "My buddy and I went for lunch (he's a Philly local; I'm an Auslander) and weren't disappointed.  Service was quite fast and the food great.  They serve the coffee in those ceramic off-white diner style mugs which I think always makes coffee taste better.  \n\nI love the 70s vibe of this place.  It has a nice cozy feel and the carpet makes one feel like they're walking into the Jungle Room.\n\nI would visit again when I'm back in Philly!"}
{"input": "For almost $6 I got a combo platter which included: fried rice, sweet plantains, bourbon chicken and honey glazed chicken. You get to pick 2 sides and 2 meats for this price. They pile it up so you'll be sure to have left overs. They move very fast and try to pull people in to try samples when they aren't already serving customers. \n\nThis place is towards the back of the food court at the King Of Prussia mall. Not to be confused with Canton which is on the side. I usually take my food to go so that I could get back to work but you could also sit at the food court while you eat."}
{"input": "We love Persis! Their chicken curry was delicious and do yourself a favor, get the cheese naan...it's amazing. The chicken biryani is one of our favorites! Very friendly staff. We will be back."}
{"input": "How has this place survived???? In Germantown no less?!?!?!? The old guy behind the counter (I'm assuming he's the proprietor) was unwelcoming, surly, and kinda rude. I only ordered a cheesesteak with fried onions...admittedly without looking at the menu..and when he told me it was $8.90, I thought I jumped into a wormhole and was in South Philly at Pat's or Geno's. Let me just jump to my summation...it wasn't worth $8.90. Did they pass a new cheesesteak tax too??? It's all good and lesson learned. I will be going back to the papi stores and getting a much better cheesesteak for half the price. And they should be ashamed for fleecing people for using credit/debit cards. Hell..they even charge more for SPENDING more. Who does that????"}
{"input": "Definitely a local joint. The atmosphere is great with local art all over the walls. Service was excellent! And the food...OMG so amazing! Wish we had one back home!"}
{"input": "Wonderful atmosphere, great selection of beers.  We ordered the Asian chicken salads and the Cajun pasta and both were excellent. We will return again."}
{"input": "Gotta love the dive bar scene! This was the second stop of our fateful Old City bar crawl and it was a pile of fun.\n\nThere's not too much space downstairs and smoking is permitted, so keep those things in mind if you're with a big group. The bartenders were friendly though--they even gave our group a bunch of yummy cookies that were leftover from a party earlier.\n\nThe upstairs is great. Complete with a jukebox and pool table, it's guaranteed to be a riot. Our group was the only one who discovered the second floor, so we had it all to ourselves. Much fun! \n\nMy biggest complaint is the price. For a dive bar, they sure know how to rob you dry. Our round of vodka shots was comparable to what you might expect in Rittenhouse Square. Not cool. But if you stick with beer, it's not too terrible.\n\nAll in all, I suggest coming here if you're already tipsy. It's pretty rough around the edges, but who doesn't love a classic Irish Pub?"}
{"input": "We absolutely love everything we have tried here. Our favorite thus far has been the Backyard Bowl, although there are several more that we still need to try. My husband and I are always full after we each get a kids size, or split a large. The ingredients are good quality,  filling foods. For the quality of ingredients, the price is very reasonable. It can get pretty busy here, but have patience, it is worth the wait."}
{"input": "So yummy! Best hotdogs in Santa Barbara hands down! Guy is super friendly and helpful. I love how they change it up every week with a different special. Definitely recommend this place you gotta try it."}
{"input": "One of the waitresses lives nearby our home. If you are looking for a place where you will get old-school service with staff that are knowledgeable about the food they are serving, this restaurant will become a favorite."}
{"input": "I love it here! Great pork shoulder, perfect \"Mex Cobb salad\", the cracky is smoked brisket with baked beans and cheddar cheese sauce! So good! I prefer the \"Tex\" opotions but \"Mex\" are pretty good. Food can be a little inconsistent though."}
{"input": "My wife and I have shopped here for years. They have the best available produce all the time - local when available and best source otherwise. We picked up sweet corn today and it was from Georgia. Last time it was California sweet corn because that was all that was available. The main reason we stopped was for Georgia peaches. Mmmm. They also have a small greenhouse and plants throughout the growing season."}
{"input": "We were planning to go to the Pancake Pantry and then Fidos for a Sunday brunch but both were very crowded.   Jackon's is located between the two.  They have great omelets..  I had the ASAP and loved it-never had an omelette like it.  They also have Conecuh  sausage which was a surprise because it is a South Alabama thing.   We love this place and the service!!"}
{"input": "It's been a while since I've visited a BJs and coming back it did not disappoint from what I remembered.\n\nFirst visited in the South, this time it seemed like best option around the outlet.\n\nTasty and huge salads is what I remembered. And it still is!\n\nThe staff were friendly and place is spacious. They have a very large variety of beer. It's not your hipster placed of beer, just simple beer of different varieties that could be passed off as craft.\n\nThey have coloring for kids. And a lot of babies and kids seem to frequent here."}
{"input": "Warning: I haven't eaten here in a couple of years, so this review may or may not be helpful.  Also, I'm mentioning Gianna Jr's here since they're the same business and the Gianna Jr's thread is no longer relevant since that location no longer exists.\n\nI've gotten vegetarian (not vegan) cheesesteaks delivered from Gianna Jr's a bunch of times and it is really awesome that the delivery guys travel so far by bike just to serve west Philadelphia :)\n\nTheir veg cheesesteaks are pretty good (or were good as perhaps indicated by other reviews) and are pretty big for the cost.  The consistency of the fake meat is different from most other places, especially China Town or places like Govinda's (Broad and South Sts), which I like.  I think they're trying to mimic real cheesestreaks as opposed to creating their own version, which makes sense since they also offer real meat in their menu."}
{"input": "I stopped in looking for a gift bottle of wine and came out with that plus a gift bag to go with it, a bottle of wine for myself and a couple beers. Tom was friendly and really knew every single wine in the shop and I was impressed with their selection. He was able to find me just the right bottle within my budget. The wine and cheese tasting sounds really fun, I can't wait to go!"}
{"input": "JB's reminds me of the kinds of restaurants that my grandparents liked to go for breakfast, but the decor has been nicely updated. And there's lots of flat screen tv's located around the room if you want to watch sports while enjoying your meal. \n\nPrice-wise, JB's is competitive with Denny's and Cora, but I find my meals more satisfying here. And they often have specials. On Thanksgiving, I greatly enjoyed my Roast Turkey Benedict, which came with a homemade Hollandaise sauce.\n\nThey have an all-you-can-eat pasta special on Thursdays for $10. It's not Corso 32 or Cafe Amore, but you don't need a reservation and it's a good value.\n\nOh, and they serve pancakes to kids for free."}
{"input": "They have a ton of flavors of ice cream. Place reminds me of ice cream parlors when I grew up. They serve food too."}
{"input": "The menu is extremely limited and overpriced. Some of the seating is weird. I would not highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"input": "Had an absolutely lovely dinner with my family. Chicken Tikka, Chana Masala, Samosas, Alogobi, Garlic Naan, This was EXCELLENT!! Service was great! Really great meal and service was very good! Excellent Evening! Would totally recommend! Great Meal Experience!"}
{"input": "Rude and unprofessional staff. I called today to find out if they had availability over the Thanksgiving holiday and the staff was short and basically said no then hung up the phone. I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"input": "Bigger than the Rittenhouse location & there's actually street parking! Server was super friendly and happy to tell me her favorites. Got a taste of the Groothie and I'm glad I did because it was too sweet for me. The Udon Noodle Salad was great."}
{"input": "We went here for lunch during a day of seeing all the historical sites. It has a fantastic location right I. The heart of everything. The staff was very nice and the portions were quite generous. I had the BLT with turkey and avocado and it was delicious. A little pricey, but highly recommend."}
{"input": "Great staff.  Nothing is ever disappointing - chili cheese etoufee is the BOMB.  It's a 4 instead of 5 stars because it's CASH ONLY.  But I love that you can also sit outside on nice evening.  \n\nDon't forget the garlic sauce!"}
{"input": "Always good food! The grilled fish is one of our favorites!  Prices are reasonable too!"}
{"input": "Updating so soon just to say that Nhu Y really hooked up my hoagies today. \n\nAs usual we got vegetarians #5 and #8 to split. By \"we\" I am, of course, employing the use of the royal \"we.\" Maybe I was saving one for later. Those bahn mi had the perfect amount of hot peppers and herbaceousness tucked into that crusty roll. I get covered in crumbs by these things. I present that to you as a good thing, though, you may be ridiculed as a Messy-Marvin.\n\nI just want to add that it was pretty adorable to watch the older husband and wife team silently making my sandwiches together. Whatever, I'm being all mushy about things but it was sweet to me for some reason. So what? Monster have...feelings?"}
{"input": "Breath of fresh air in an area with a dearth of good pizza joints.  Great pizza and love the rock-n-roll atmosphere.  Can do without the long wait to sit but that's what happens when you're one of 4 places in the east-Tampa suburbs that can actually make an edible pizza."}
{"input": "Spoke with Josh, awesome Guy! Very knowledgable with product, and e-juice ! Being open for a year and a half they are KILLIN IT ! Way to go guys :)"}
{"input": "I've never seen a larger or better selection of beer in my life! All are sold by the bottle, and the prices are awesome! The employees are always happy to help and greet you with a genuine smile. Little known- this place also serves sandwiches, panini's and wraps. The different choices are sometimes exotic, but alway delicious. But if you know what you want, you can always \"create your own\" any way you want it. If you're on the run, you can get anywhere from this location. Or- just grab a table! Enjoy a beer or two with your sandwich and see what's up and coming in the local community. I love this place."}
{"input": "Mis En Chic is a beautiful shop offering french country style home goods.  While a modest size store, MEC offers a solid variety of items from dressing the table to setting the mood in your living or bedroom space.  A small section features select wearables, including lingerie; and seek out a table boosting delicious lip glazes.  If you are a fan of unusual scented candles, this is a wonderful place to find something unique for yourself or as a gift.  \n\nStaff is available to assist at your request, allowing you to peruse unencumbered.  \nMis En Chic is definitely on my list of places to frequent when on Central Ave!"}
{"input": "BEST PRALINES IN TOWN. \n\nThey are generous with samples, so go in there and try all the flavors (original, rum, chocolate, coconut, etc.). \n\nBRING ME SOME WHEN YOU GO! SERIOUSLY!"}
{"input": "Maybe I should not have expected much from a sushi joint in Nashville. I mean, really, it's as if i'd been let down because a cuban restaurant didn't live up to my Miami standards. I didn't come to Nashville to eat sushi, but I really craved it while I was in town and my girlfriend who was showing us around said she'd been there a long time ago and remembered that it was a buffet-style place in a great location.\n\nDone deal. We get there, and she was right about the area. The food was quite underwhelming. Nothing tasted very fresh. In fact, everything I got from the sushi buffet was soggy and maybe even slightly warm (not good for uncooked food). They do have a small sake selection of sake of which we enjoyed an unfiltered bottle of. The price for 3 people eating from the buffet, 1 small bottle of sake and 1 Sapporro came out to just over $70.\n\nNot a place I'd look forward to going to again. I wish I could give it a better review and rating!!!"}
{"input": "I've been here 3 times before and loved it. But tonight... the kitchen is SO slow. My family and I waited on our food (two sir chicken sandwiches and a cheese omelet) for twenty five minutes. Our server was really nice and apologetic. But it really shouldn't have taken 25 minutes to make two sandwiches and an omelet."}
{"input": "My wife and I have been here a few times.  Appetizers and salads are average.  We've had the deep dish pizza a couple times and last time we had it was years ago at other locations.  Feel like its not as good as before, maybe its just this location.  Service in bar area was good, not as good in the main dining area, waiter forgot our waters and my beer.  Best thing about this place is the beer selection, awesome rotation of craft beers from all over."}
{"input": "We ate here for supper based on the reviews. I got the stuffed flounder which was delicious.  My husband got the feast which was crab legs, shrimp, and mussels. It was also flavorful and yummy. As a bonus kids eat free on Tuesdays. We also had wonderful service."}
{"input": "This is a great little bar. Ambience is very lovely. Nice selection of unique cocktails to choose from. And enough microbrews to keep the husband happy. We were there the week before Mardi Gras, and the crowd was very sparse. People were much happier dancing in the streets! They did have live music, which was nice. And they were also showing movies on the TV behind the bar with subtitles on, which is a nice distraction. The bartenders were not very attentive, but they were training a new guy, so that explains it. And they were having a good time. I would go back."}
{"input": "Came here with some friends during Mardi Gras. Even though it was a busy weekend and lots of people everywhere a lot of places aren't over crowded. The bartenders were just awful. The service was lacking and the pizza sucked. \n\nPROS:\n-They had Port-O-Potty (2) put back which made it easier for a bathroom break\n-Outdoor seating area\n-Near the parade route (convenient) \n\nCONS:\n-Bartenders don't take drink orders properly: they skip people, ignore you at the bar when you walk up (it wasn't that busy), lots of standing around\n-Bartenders didn't know what microbrew meant or IPA beers (no joke)"}
{"input": "My favorite coffee shop in Tampa. All of their flavored lattes are delicious. They also have bagels, muffins,  gluten-free banana bread (pumpkin bread for today), and homemade cakes."}
{"input": "Went here for a drink after dinner at Kuma's and loved the teki bar!  The $4 house margarita special on Tuesday is well worth the visit.   The painkiller is a wonderful cocktail!  Highly recommended.  Staff is very friendly and service is great!"}
{"input": "This place had AMAZING food. I loved everything about the presentation of the food to the eating of it :-) I WILL be returning!"}
{"input": "FINALLY a great pizza in Florida.  If you like thin stone pizza with great flavor, THIS IS the place.  Very impressed and Jenny is a sweetheart at the bar."}
{"input": "Both my friend and I ordered taco platters for dinner. He had crunchy tacos with beef and I had the corn taco with chicken. The platters come with 3 tacos at dinner (2 at lunch), refried beans and rice and sauces and everything was good. Service was efficient and the waiter was very pleasant. I think the entire bill came to under $25 so you really can't beat it. They also do take out if you don't want to eat in. Just be ready for that crazy decor of all primary colors and a lot of it. Good for a quick bite if you're in the Frazer-Malvern area."}
{"input": "This is a great independent auto shop--I have been going here about 4 years. They service all types of cars, and are very honest and knowledgeable. I had an issue with a warrantied battery replacement, and it turned out that I owed a portion of the battery costs after they submitted the claim. They didn't call me and tell me that I owed them the money. They just noted it on my file until the next time I came in for service, which wasn't until months later--they didn't have to wait like that, but they did without me even asking.  The shop is super clean, the owners are super nice, and they always have Corvettes, Vipers, Lotus, Jaguars, classic cars, or some other expensive car that they are working on or selling."}
{"input": "Jambalaya, gator sausage, and beignets are phenomenal.  We just can't find jambalaya this good for miles and miles around.  Thrilled to have them here."}
{"input": "We always make a trip here when we are on the north side of Indy. They always have a great selection of beer available. They also always have free popcorn! No other food for purchase but you can bring your own or order from takeout menus they have. Dog friendly!  Watch out for the Brew Bus they commonly visits- it can get pretty busy when they show up. The employees are good at warning people before their arrival."}
{"input": "Tried it for the first time today. Only a few blocks from my house and I had no clue this delicious place existed. Service was great and the food didn't taste greasy at all. I wish their vegetarian selection was a little more varied but their veggie omelette, the California sammich, and house potatoes were yum!!! They make their bread and pastries in house."}
{"input": "I eat here at least once a month, and more often when possible.  The brisket tacos and brisket quesadillas are fantastic.  Happy hour starts at 3 if you're interested in a late lunch for 2-for-1 drinks."}
{"input": "My family and I have been going to this restaurant for a few years now and my parents are very good friends with the owner, Eddie and his wife, Mary. It used to be know as Long Wong's but just recently had a name change because of it's location. You can go to this restaurant and have the very best wings in several different flavors. Ranging from Teriyaki or Honey Hot to your traditional Mild and Very Hot these wings are crispy and juicy all at the same time. If you are not up for wings they have great hamburger, hot dog, or chicken strip baskets served with very tasty fries. I absolutely love their fried zucchini and fried mushroom appetizers with ranch dressing. The atmosphere can get pretty wild during any Arizona Wildcat game as the owners are big fans. You can even just stop in for a drink at the bar and some chit chat. We have ordered their wings in very large numbers for special events and they have always had our orders ready on time and just the way we ask for them!"}
{"input": "Seated within 10 minutes at 7:30pm on a Saturday night.  Good draft beer selection.  Enjoyed the Apple Bacon Quesadillas and the Calamari for apps.  Really good guacamole with the quesadillas!  I loved the Apple Bacon Pizza; good crust and interesting toppings.  H said that the Turkey Club was one of the best he's ever had.  S had a tortellini special that he said was excellent.  Great atmosphere (sat in the quieter upper dining room).  Friendly service."}
{"input": "Went there yesterday for the restaurant week lunch. Terrific view of Philadelphia, probably a lot better at night. We had the shrimp cocktail and smoked salmon as the first course, both very good. For the second course, had the farm egg frittata and the fried flounder sandwich, which were good. The third course of lemon meringue tart and toasted banana marshmallow was excellent. If you like marshmallows, the toasted banana marshmallow is a must-have. Flawless service, one of the best I have seen."}
{"input": "Let me start by saying, these amazing women were extremely accomodating and got me in for an appointment VERYlast minute (20 to be exact) for a birthday brazillian, brow/lip wax, and mani/ pedi...The waxing wasn't terribly painful (this wasn't my first rodeo) but it wasn't a nice walk in the park either. However, she did take her time and did a great job (why they insist on leaving a \"landing strip\" is beyond me). I wasn't entirely impressed with the actual ambiance/decor. It's not what I expected when I saw \"spa\" in the name. However, with all of that being said, it was a good experience overall and I will go back if I need last-minute primping or don't find a place a like better. I found it a little over-priced, but not outrageous. Everyone was very nice and made me feel very comfortable."}
{"input": "Late nite treat\n\nI can't believe I still love this place\n\nNo lines \nNo fuss\nAlways what you expect\n\nPowdery sweet warm beignets and a hot yummy coffee\n\nEnjoy"}
{"input": "Wish I could give 0 stars! We went with a lot of clothes in hand and while they were going through them, we looked around the store. They lied to us and said they wouldn't take clothes that were more than 18 months out of style/trend! Jeans and T-Shirts are NEVER out of trend.  They didn't buy anything from us and they were sending everyone who came in to sell their clothes away without buying anything from anyone because they were too lazy and didn't want to do work."}
{"input": "Really great made to order pizza, like a Chipotle for pizza! I had the alligator sausage with pepperoni, onions, mushrooms and jalapeños on mine and it was delicious! Great beer and smores pie too (use the Yelp offer for the smores pie)! Some issues with charging for this free pie but otherwise great service too!"}
{"input": "On a recent trip to Port Richey, I selected Holiday Inn Express for a couple of reasons.  The main reason was the option of two beds (as I was sharing the room with my brother).  The other reasons were:  price, vicinity to my aunt's home and complementary breakfast. \n\nMy family and I typically stay at the Hyatt Place/House when we're traveling.  However, since it was just my brother and I, I figured we'd give Holiday Inn a shot. \n\n+  The staff were very friendly and helpful.\n+  Free wifi.\n+  Breakfast was very good, offering both hot and cold entrees. \n\n-  Sadly, the beds were WAY TOO soft.  It felt as if the mattresses were past their life expectancy.  As a result, I didn't really sleep well for most of my three nights there.\n-  The a/c was hit and miss with the lack of reliable thermostat controls. \n\nThere was a pool and hot tub, but since I didn't utilize either, it wouldn't be fair to rate them.  There also a small gym that I didn't use either. \n\nAll in all, it was just ok.  Hyatt has spoiled me."}
{"input": "Romantic lighting, fantastic food, and gorgeous belly dancers. What more could you ask for? Maybe a better parking arrangement"}
{"input": "never gets old. i get the chocolate malt with light on the chocolate. best ice cream custard thing i have ever had in my life."}
{"input": "Let me start by saying, this is OTB, not the Chez Jene. As far as a bar / restaurant goes, this place is nice, and a major upgrade to the old location in Claypool Courts.\n\nThe bar / restaurant area was modern and clean. The staff were friendly and helpful. The prices were reasonable, considering the part of downtown, and that you are at an off track betting facility.\n\nNow for the OTB part, this was a separate area from the bar, separated by two large frosted glass doors. The betting areas are all non smoking, which is great. No one wants to breath the crap that blew out of lungs of one of these peeps.  There is a smoking area for the people  who want to step out for a smoke.\n\nExcellent selection of local craft beers, a major upgrade from the last OTB location.\n\nI will return to lose more money in the future. This is a nice place for OTB!"}
{"input": "The exceptional customer service I received even before I was in town made this place worthwhile. As a visitor, I reached out on Facebook asking if they could make a reservation for two for brunch. I don't believe they normally make reservations, but they were very kind and willing. As soon as we arrived, they had our seat ready and they were expecting us.\n\nOur meals were tasty, I had the Chicken or the Egg special, and loved the $15 bottomless drinks, which you could switch out between a bloody mary, mimosa and sangria for no extra cost. Our waitress was very friendly.\n\nTo top it all off, the owner/head chef visited our table as he knew we were \"the people from Facebook.\" He thanked us for our business, chatted with us about our hometown for a while and gave us his business card with personal cell phone number for us to call if we needed anything while we were in town! Talk about friendly!"}
{"input": "The menu isn't extensive but great to go to if you're craving a classic bibimbap.  I would recommend the extra dollar for the stone bowl.  The man who runs the shop is sweet and makes sure you have a good dine in experience.   Also, the location is close to the Magic Gardens."}
{"input": "We had dinner at Convivio right after it opened and we will definitely go back. There were a few minor quirks with the service and with wine being out of stock, but I'm chalking it up to the fact that it just opened and they were working out the kinks. The owner visited our table and he could not have been nicer or more gracious. The food was excellent...nothing to change there! I had the tortelloni pansotti, and i think it was the best pasta I've ever had. I'm sure we will be frequent diners ."}
{"input": "I LOVE RALPHS.. \nMy now Ex Husband \"Lenny\" used to bring me here all the time.. The food is scrumptious.. The mussels red or white are to die for.Food is always fresh and prepared to order. The Owners 'Jimmy and Eddie\", super nice, very accomodating and made me feel like family... Ronnie too!!\nI always left here in a food coma... Highly reccommend this wonderful Restuarant.. Gets very busy especially on weekends....Always a great dining experience!!"}
{"input": "Always fun to go to their shows.  Entertaining and relaxed atmosphere. For a good time and good food at a fair price this is the place to go."}
{"input": "**EDIT** 7/12\nI've since been and for sure have changed my opinion. Again, as I said below, I think I caught them on a bad day. 3rd time was a charm for me. IF I get a hankering for some good greek / med food... I'll check it out.\n\nOh and to the reply from the vendor, no my first review wasn't a joke. My opinions still stand from my initial visit, HOWEVER since I went back i even tried Bubble Tea, for that alone... I'm a HUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE fan.\n\n\nShort and not sweet ... avoid this place. Maybe I just got them on a bad day... but suffice to say nothing was good. Sauce sucked, lettuce brown, long wait , expensive, and just dry and tasteless. Gyros should be savory and moist! sorry I won't be visiting again."}
{"input": "Great ramen! I'm really happy to have found this place! The service and food are both wonderful!"}
{"input": "This Tim Hortons location you're gonna love entering into, very modern and Cafe shiek combined to the fact there's a lot of open space so you won't feel cramped and the open ceiling I've noticed minimizes crowd sounds, so you'll be able to have amazing conversations with your friends."}
{"input": "An okay hotel. \n\nCons: Our room was in the northeast corner every morning (we were there for about a week) around 6am I would be woken up by a truck backing up. Our TP holder would not stay attached to the wall and it took several calls to the front desk to get maintenance up to fix it. A friend had a clogged bathtub drain and it was only partially cleared by the end of the trip.\n\nPros: Location and breakfast, aside from issues above, hotel room was clean"}
{"input": "The best. The low quotes are gret.Their work is impeccable and they are as honest and professional as it gets.  II 've used much larger body shops and chains in the past. Never again."}
{"input": "Staff friendly. Convenient location. Nice local honky tonks in walking distance. Rooms need updating but were clean."}
{"input": "Friendly staff.  Great bagels.  Awesome breads and good coffee.  Plus a nive atmosphere.  Best Bagels in suburban Philly.  Love this place."}
{"input": "I love this place! The pizza is perfection due in part to the wood fired oven. The appetizers are great too. They use really ingredients and it shows. It is a simple neopalatin style pizza but the flavors all work well to make a great pizza. Service is great and they always have a amazing selection of beers."}
{"input": "Huge menu !!!!!!!!! Something for everyone!\n\nGood lunch specials--drink and soup included!!!!\n\nBeen staying with the corned beef sandwich lately-very good-very fresh rye bread.\n\nFood is fine!! very large lunch crowd!\n\nAVOID \"Ruby\" the waitress. She hates her job and it shows in her negative attitude and lack of efficient service. She's goin thru the motions and hating every minutes of it.\nIf you don't ask for items-------you don't get them----pickles...Pepsi....correct order."}
{"input": "I had a great experience at the West Beach Inn.  I blindly booked it online because the rate was great and the website mentioned recent renovations.\n\nI was immediately pleased upon check-in when we were greeted with wine and cheese in the lobby.  Once we got to the rooms we were even more impressed.  Everything was completely redone - new furniture, fixtures, bed, bathroom, floors, everything was beautiful.  And the beds!! ahh the beds, soooo comfortable.  I got a great night sleep.\n\nThe hotel is located across the street from a public beach and is walking distance to many restaurants and shops.  I said it many times during my stay and I'll say it again - I'll definitely stay there again when I come back to SB.  I couldn't have been happier with my stay."}
{"input": "Decent place for lunch. Overall service is good with friendly employees."}
{"input": "We drive out of town to Philadelphia just to eat here. We have been here many times over the past 5 years. I can only say that the tofu soup (and everything else)  here always tastes so good. They always get the spiciness right, and we have never had a complaint here! This is a must-try in Philadelphia if you're a fan of Korean food."}
{"input": "I had no idea pudding could be this good! I went here late in the day hoping to score a cupcake (or two), but they were all out. Which turned out to be a boon because I probably would have overlooked the pudding otherwise. We were offered samples of banana pudding, peanut butter pudding, and strawberry banana pudding, each as delicious as the last. This stuff is like the Häagen-Dazs of pudding: rich, creamy, and indulgent. In fact, it's closer to eating custard-y ice cream than any pudding you've ever had. We'll definitely be back for more since the two containers we took home with us are sadly already gone."}
{"input": "We were back last night for the second time: as with the first, it was a splendid dinner experience. Style, quality, presentation: everything sets this restaurant apart. It is a welcome addition to the Santa Barbara food scene. I do like the simple, unassuming atmosphere.\nFinally a restaurant that will change its menu once a month!!"}
{"input": "This place has a great clean modern feel. Kim is the lady in charge and wants you to be nothing but very happy when you are leaving. I usually go to her but she recommended I try someone new. I did and Lane did a wonderful job. Great pedicure, new massage chairs, perfect gel manicures (not thick or thin in areas). Mcalisters is right next door so fun to grab a tea and get your nails done."}
{"input": "Loved the place!!! It was my first time to a breakfast buffet, and I was really impressed. They had all kinds of variety for breakfast...right from salads, cereals to pastas, pancakes, waffles! The sweets were mindblowing! The best part of the buffet was the complimentary champagne"}

{"input": "Great Rock Crab, loved the clam chowder, excellent service. And who can say no to onion rings?\n\nDidn't really like the fried seafood - batter didn't stay crisp very long. Nothing was over cooked, just didn't like the batter."}
{"input": "Love this store!  Who doesn't!  The salad bar is fresh and they have all types of ethnic food to try.  N-JOY"}
{"input": "Second time here and just as great! All around one of the best BBQ places. The brisket was absolutely perfect this time also. Took my girlfriend this time and she was equally impressed."}
{"input": "I love this place! A group of friends and I were looking for a late night place to grab something sweet and some locals recommended this place. After a trolley ride and wandering around, we finally made it. The environment is really comfortable with pictures of patrons on the bright walls. What makes this place special is the homemade and unique ice creams. If you can't decide, they will let you sample a bunch of flavors. You can even get half scoops. I came back several times during my stay in NOLA!\n\nHere's the flavors I got:\n-lavender honey (my fav)\n-red velvet\n-chocolate amaretto cheesecake\n-almond toffee\n\nHighly recommended!"}
{"input": "They take advantage of people who doesn't speak English and sign them up for a membership. They have ridiculous rules about cancelling membership but luckily for my father, he was from CA. I sent them a message via their website in December saying I have a copy of his license and I'd like to e-mail them to prove that he's not from the area and have his membership cancelled. No one bothered to reply back with an e-mail address nor physical mailing address since January was around the corner and they can rob my father of that extra month of membership fee. No wonder these thieves aren't successful as the two major gym we have nationwide. Sooner they get that through their thick skull and start having some decent customer service, sooner they'd be successful. Terrible experience. Don't use this place. You'll definitely get robbed."}
{"input": "I had a great time at Tomo! The Sake and edamame were very good but the sushi was amazing! I highly recommend the volcano roll - you will be mind blown! :) and don't worry - it looks a little sketchy outside but the inside is full of awesome decor!"}
{"input": "Just had a delightful breakfast. Good service, good atmosphere, and really good food. Omelette was fluffy and made with fresh ingredients. Crepes were creative and very well prepared and presented. Mocca was very good. Prices are reasonable (not cheap, but not out of line at all). Highly recommended. Full bar available for Bloody Maries and mimosa. Parking is free. Congrats to the owners/staff. Nice job."}
{"input": "Really not sure what the hype was when it opened. It's fine, the ambiance was nice, but the menu is limited and food is nothing to write home about. They are in a nice location so at least if you decide to wait, then you have things to see..."}
{"input": "After searching for the best beignets in New Orleans, we finally found it at Morning Call.   The beignets were absolute perfection.  Flaky, poofy and beautifully golden brown.  We asked our waitress what was special about theirs and she said that it's the sourdough in the dough.  She also said that they had just changed their frying oil which made them extra delicious, I'm sure. \n\nAnd my husband said the cafe au lait was to die for as well. \n\nPlease don't waste your time going to the other beignet places unless what you really want is a crispy fried funnel cake (no lie!). Stop by Morning Call on your way in or out of New Orleans and you won't be disappointed.  Open 24/7."}
{"input": "I'm all for a dive bar but this place takes it to another level. The walls are old wood panel, the whole place smells disgusting, the drinks are tiny...I don't feel any need to ever go there again."}
{"input": "This is one of my favorite hibachi grills of all time. The cooks are always so wonderful, and the food is amazing."}
{"input": "I really enjoyed my dinner at Slate. Our waitress was great. The food was really good and well priced especially considering the location. My wife and I split the short rib mac and cheese which was as good as I hoped it would be though it's not really meant for sharing - I suggest you get your own. My wife had the salmon which she liked and I had the Slate Burger. I had heard so much about it in reviews that I just had to have it. While it wasn't the best burger I've ever had it was quite good. Fresh, local ingredients made it worth the try. They also have a good beer menu to go along with the lively bar scene. \nMy only problem with the place was the noise. Apparently I'm 32 going on 65. I guess I was expecting a nice quiet dinner and I had to shout across the table to talk to my wife. \n\nSlate. Not amazing, but very good food and prices. Bring ear plugs."}
{"input": "It's a good thing I've had a few weeks to cool off from my experience at Copabanana before writing this review or it might not have been pretty. Anyhow, I came during university city restaurant week and will never return. We sat outside and there were kids playing football right near the tables and being loud. We moved to the other side of the restaurant (still outside) and the kids made there way over to us and continued playing. We couldnt get away. We went to a table inside. Food was terrible. Steak was fatty and overcooked and mashed potatoes werent fresh. The waitress was about the only thing good about this place. She agreed on the steak and took it back. Came back with chicken as I asked for and it was like biting into rubber bands. All in all it was a disaster and I'll never return. 1 star for the waitress."}
{"input": "It was really dogging me that I hadn't yet had the chance to try Hot Diggity. (Thank you, I'll be here all week. #tryTheHotDog.) Now that we've dispensed with the obligatory hot dogging, let's get to the review, shall we? I don't want to end up in the dog house. \n\nI had the chance to try a dog from the Hot Diggity cart at the South Street Night Market last night. (This review is of the cart, not the storefront.) It was a pretty fantastic hotdog, born of a stroke of genius. It was called the Mango Kimchi dog. The perfectly cooked dog, producing a Randy-Savage-snapping-into-a-Slim-Jim loud thunderclap with each bite, was topped with: spicy kimchi, mangos, sweet bean paste, and crispy rice noodles. HUH? Well, it worked, and it was awesome. And at only $5, I'm not sure how they even covered their R&D costs (which must have been formidable).\n\nAs the old saying goes, every day has its dog (or something)."}
{"input": "This place is so modern and beautiful on the inside and out! I like to come here for songwriters night whenever I can and sometimes end up staying just for fun. My room was gorgeous and overlooked the court house. The decor in the rooms is fantastic. Also, there is a Starbucks downstairs. Kudos."}
{"input": "We came for a friend's birthday, free for him and we all got all you can eat and it was fantastic! Check in on yelp for free sake or beer"}
{"input": "Food used to great years ago but getting really chintzy.  Beef with broccoli, thin tough pieces of beef, six slices covered in veggies.  Not many people, and seeing dirty aqarium while eating not indusive to fine dining,"}
{"input": "Cafe Beignet was a nice little cafe on Bourbon St. with a nice courtyard off the sidewalk and tucked away from the commotion. Inside the courtyard are plenty of fans that also blow mist at you during the hot summer days. Unfortunately I have to give the 3 stars because the beingets just weren't that good. They were chewy and chalky and the only flavor that came threw was the powdered sugar. I didn't try the other food so I can't speak for that but their iced coffee is really refreshing. It's a dark roast with smokey notes that really come through in NOLA style. Service was on the slower side with only one register but the girl at the register was extremely nice."}
{"input": "This place is top notch, with phenomenal service and such fantastic ambiance- how can you go elsewhere? All of the food looked and smelled amazing. I love how creative everything was.\nI CANT STOP DAYDREAMING ABOUT THE FOOD. Hands down, best brunch experience of my life. I don't even like french toast usually and theres was by far the most delicious food thats ever entered my mouth. I am literally drooling while writing this.\nThe chicken and waffles were unreal and standout A++++. \nI love the \"flinstones pushup-pop\" drink so creative and clever.\nEven the deviled eggs were the best I've personally ever had. They do everything right even when it comes to the music. It was super fun and such a great experience! Ignore any review thats not 4 stars because they must be delusional."}
{"input": "I love this park been there a many times with my Ginger, recently I've encountered aggressive dogs which I've decided to take a break. My dog was bit in the face by a dog and the woman walked away with little to no care. I want to report this to the head of the park to make awareness of this type of behavior. Does anyone know where I would go for such?"}
{"input": "Not very good. No salami. Boiled ham instead of baked. No salami. More like a Miami Cuban. This is Tampa. They're in the middle of a Hispanic area so you'd expect they'd do it right. Nope. Never again."}
{"input": "Customer service is where it's at. Look at this place. Decent lunch and breakfast food. I mean it all tastes great but it's just basic stuff, nothing different from the trucks on campus. Except one thing.. RICHIE! He's the man, he's made himself a local celebrity on campus with his great attitude and awesome service. I'm telling you he's a genius because why do I choose to come here over any other place on campus? Richie of course."}
{"input": "This is the best Caribbean food in town, hands down. Everything was so fresh, not too heavy, cooked to perfection. My fiancé had stewed chicken and I had the curried chicken- both were excellent. I also had an order of plantains that were the best I've ever had. The owner came out to chat and made sure we'd gotten enough food and liked everything. \n\nThe prices are incredible, and evidently there are some things not on the menu, such as oxtails, that are available. \n\nAlso- it's a BYOB!\n\nWill definitely return and tell everyone I know to try this place out. Worth every 5-star review- they're real, folks."}
{"input": "The Waffle House has consistent quality wherever you go. I'm not really fond of their business model with their yelling and very small dining area, but I get it. \nI still look forward to going for breakfast."}
{"input": "I frequent the HOB in Oldsmar about once/month, or so. I've drank there more than ate but have had the caesar salad for dinner before;it was pretty small but a great price. The buffalo chicken dip is DELISH as are the chicken nachos. The key is to go before 7pm for their happy hour, which includes half off their appetizers. They also have $5 beer night on Thursdays. You can bring up to a LITER mug of your own and they will fill it for $5. The place is small but the atmosphere was fun. HOB would be the neighboorhood bar if there were more things on this strip of street to do...we have a good time and it was a pretty chill atmosphere."}

{"input": "Sassafras Restaurant has a nicely-decorated exterior (strip mall) and a very attractive, clean, neat, and welcoming interior. The waiter was very friendly and helpful. We ordered Seafood Platters, which came with catfish, oysters, shrimp, fries, and a delicious house salad, as an appetizer. The salad dressings were home made, and the fried seafood items were well seasoned and not the least bit greasy. Also, the portions were generous. We were all very pleased and remarked that we would certainly return. RJT"}
{"input": "Muriel's is wonderful. Great food and impeccable service. We ate in the dining room for lunch one day and another time just popped into the bar at the back for a drink and cooling off.  Zach the bartender is amazing!  And also a cutie. :)"}
{"input": "Ordered burger and wings. My husband and I split them great portions to split. Best burger we ever had! Made with short ribs. The wings were great.  The sauce was excellent little sweet and a little spicy.  Oh yeah the beer very good. Excellent service order at the bar and they serve you. All round great service."}
{"input": "Service was a bit slow but it was a Monday night and they had a groupon promotion so giving them the benefit of the doubt that they probably have more employees on staff during traditionally busy days but the gluten free pizza was better than any I've had within a 20 mike radius and I think I've tried them all. It was amazing. My husband who does not have a gluten sensitivity thought it was better than even their Sicilian crust (which he loves by the way). Glad it's in the neighborhood. We will definitely be going back."}
{"input": "First time i came here two months ago, it was decent and the chicken com tam plate was good. The pho was good too, but when i came here today, it wasnt close to being as good. It was actually pretty bad. Inconsistent i guess"}
{"input": "This place was just OK.  My fiancée and I shared their warm salad with vinaigrette as an app.  It was very interesting and flavorful.  Oddly enough, it was literally a head of romaine on a plate with vinaigrette, strawberries, tomatoes and blue cheese on top.  We both really enjoyed it.    For entrees, I got veal medallions with mozzarella and prosciutto in a mushroom sauce and my fiancée got their stuffed calamari in linguine.  Mine wasn't too bad although I was expecting the veal to be more tender.  It was slightly tough and dry.  Her calamari was surprisingly tough and chewy which kinda ruined things.\n\nAll in all, we had a good time.  It's a quaint place and the service was excellent.  The food just fell a bit short of our expectations.  It wasn't TOO expensive, but at this price point, the food should be better.  Unfortunately, I don't think we'll be back."}
{"input": "Yum!  Food is good, but everyone should really come for the frozen drinks!  So tasty..."}
{"input": "Question:  What do you do when you're only in St Louis for 16 hours or less?\n\nAnswer:  You go to Pi for dinner and then order an additional 2 large deep dish pizza's to go too!\n\nWell you would if you were me!  That's pretty much exactly what we did.  We enjoyed most of a large deep dish Bucktown at the restaurant and took a large deep dish Berkley and South Side Classico to go.\n\nHowever, the smell of Pi filling a little car for 5 hours is fairly intoxicating.  We lasted about 2 hours before we made a pit stop for another slice while on the road.  \n\nSo looking forward to reheating a slice for dinner, it reheats pretty well in a toaster oven or the regular oven.  My mouth waters just thinking about it.  \n\nDoes Pi deliver to Chicago?  How about Milwaukee?"}

{"input": "I love this place!  I am always entertained at Comedy Sportz.  Even the early shows--which are \"clean\" and family-friendly--are hilarious!  Who would have thought you could take clean humor and make it so darn funny, week-after-week?  The late shows are adult-only, and are a blast!!!  I recommend this place to all my friends and go as often as I can.  You should give CSz a try!\n\nFor your first time, go and see a \"traditional\" show--not the Improv Jam.  The Improv Jams are only a couple of bucks, but are hit-and-miss.  \n\nAlso, eat before you go.  I gave a rating of 4 out of 5 stars because the food here is not so great.  They do have a menu, but it's mostly just nachos and hot dogs.  They don't allow outside food/beverages.\n\nI did have a customer-service issue one time.  However, I am very impressed with the way it was handled by the marketing director.  It is clear that Comedy Sportz cares about keeping customers, and keeping them happy.  Way to go!!  I can't wait to go back to CSz and get my next comedy fix!"}
{"input": "Visited this restaurant for the first time on a Saturday night.  If you want good Italian food and reasonable prices, this is certainly a good choice.  However, I wouldn't give it five stars (or even four stars) based on this visit.  First of all, there was a considerable delay between the time we finished our salads and the serving of the entree (the server was apologetic about this).  Also, my Chicken Francese was tender and tasty, but swimming in an excessive amount of lemon sauce."}
{"input": "Smokey (to be expected - minus a star as a non smoker with allergies), several dining options (prices varies), beverages (all sorts for a nominal fee, of course), hotel (pricey), parking (FREE), entertainment (various), ATM (scared for some people who may not have self control), and yes gambling (tip: don't gamble if you're bit willing to lose it). Have fun even if you are an observer (like me)."}

{"input": "Love love love their pizza!!!!!  We went there for the first time tonight. We started with the honey buffalo wings. This is probably the only reason they got 4 and not 5 stars. The wings were on the small side. Aside from that they were not crispy and I didn't taste any honey in the sauce. I'd probably order them again but make sure you specify extra crispy. The pizza however, was awesome. I got the Parma. I made sure they added the arugula AFTER the pizza was cooked. It was so good that even though I'm stuffed I can't wait until I'm hungry again so I can enjoy my leftovers!  They also had a twisted pretzel beer that tasted like a pretzel!!!  It was so good and not heavy even though it was a dark beer. Make sure to go next door and get some gelato for dessert."}
{"input": "This place just keeps getting better. The people there are so nice and they make a heck of a taco. They just added seating inside as well as more produce. Perfect for anyone in the nations. They are are also starting to serve Bongo Java coffee on their coffee bar as well as a large assortment of Rishi tea! Highly recommend stopping in and becoming a regular."}
{"input": "This location used to be good, several years ago. About 3 years ago it started to go downhill and now it is just terrible. There were 2 people working on a Saturday evening. Nearly all the tables were full and there were people waiting to order and to pay. The sandwich that was made for me was on hard bread, burnt and barely edible. They need to either shape up or ship out."}
{"input": "Very cool place. Came in for lunch. \n\nDecor is awesome. Very open and great natural lighting. We checked out upstairs before we left and it was great also. They did an awesome job decorating and I was really impressed how well this place was put together!!! So cool to see this old building turned into something so awesome! \n\nWent for with our family and friends, table of 7. We were seated quickly, service was prompt. Orders were correct. We had 3 burgers, pulled pork, Mac n cheese and the kale and cheese dip between all of us and not one of us was disappointed. Great food. Fries were crispy but not overdone and burgers were delicious. Cooked perfectly and nice and juicy. \n\nBeers. Great. Tasty. My wife had a taster and all were really good. Neither of us are stout fans but it will still good and we both loved the IPA. \n\nWe all agreed that we can't wait to come down for drinks and dinner with no kiddos so we can try the whiskey!"}
{"input": "Reminded this transplanted Bostonian of home. The Guinness was excellently poured. The decor reminded me of numerous bars and clam stands I frequented in New England. But the crowing jewel was the bowl of chowda. Thick, creamy, generous portions of clams and potatoes, and topped with old fashioned packet of Nabisco Oyster Crackers. This has become a new favorite and \"must\" stop every time I make the drive up to Nashville. I also suggest (and bring a cooler during the warm months) that you buy the Boston Crème Pie to go and take home for a late night indulgence."}
{"input": "Food was good. I had the weekly champion burger, The Vermont Breakfast. Great! The fries, catsup, and other sauces were good too. Beer selection was good, but JESSICA was the best. Sit at the bar and have faith she'll give you a great experience! Best service I've ever had in my life."}
{"input": "To sum it up, it's an average bar with ties to a very well-known TV show - but that fact doesn't make the food or much else better. When I went they had $4 White Rascal's and on top of that I had the normal gravy fries. $11 for fries, steep to say the least. They were steak fries, covered in gravy and mozzarella cheese and while pretty damn good, I would be hesitant to say that they're worth the price. Service was good, sometimes a little slow, but still friendly."}
{"input": "This is a destination restaurant perfect for a special night out. Its uniqueness makes it a perfect place to impress someone. As a more recent addition to the Bailey's group of restaurants, L'Acadiane is on par with the quality they are well known for.\n\nIf you're a fan of New Orleans style or southern food in general, you will love the St. Louis twist they put on the food here. There is just enough kick to it without being overpowering. We tried a bit of everything. The poblano grits were a favorite as well as the roffignac cocktail made with sparkling rosé- a perfect blend between the raspberry and lemon. \n\nRandall, our server was super patient. He realized we were there to take our time, and we did not feel rushed. He did his best to answer questions and cater to allergies. Many of the menu items contain shrimp, but they are well aware this is a problem for many people and can make accommodations. \n\nGive them a try for a southern experience close to home!"}

{"input": "I was excited to try this place out and planned on getting to this place no matter what while I was in Philadelphia.  My friend and I took a taxi from DT to the restaurant when it opened. Got seated quickly and ordered 3 items to try - grilled steak with prohak dipping sauce, caramelized ground pork with coconut milk and vegetables, and samlaw machu kreung (beef soup with vegetables).  My least favorite was the caramelized ground pork - it was a little too sweet for me.  I love this dish at other Cambodian restaurants but unfortunately it was too sweet here.  But the rest of the dishes were very very delicious.  I wanted to order other dishes but there was only 2 of us and it would have been too much food.  Got a chance to talk to the family that owns this place and they were very friendly.  Highly recommend."}

The salon itself is always very clean. The staff knows their clients and there is a reason they are always busy. They are awesome. Best nail salon in St. Louis, hands down."}

The cake was both elegant and delicious, a rare combination."}
{"input": "I was very disappointed with my recent stay here. I've been quite happy with SPG/Aloft hotels normally but this Aloft was just awful. The entire facility was poorly kept and generally dirty. The occupants of the neighboring room were up until the early morning (3am) smoking & drinking inside/outside their room. The staff conveyed overall apathy and did little to nothing as a result. Save yourself a headache and look for a better option if staying around here."}
{"input": "I went there once years ago\nI believe I cut my order down when the employee went from picking up trash to picking up my bagels No glove, not even paper.. I don;t recall all the details, but my immediate thought was it's another establishment that has no concept of hygiene and exploits the lack of oversight..To top it off, the bagels were far from fresh\nNeedless to say, I haven't been back\nBut I realize many people don't care about cleanliness. If that's you, you'll enjoy this place."}

We had previously stayed at the Castillo Inn at the beach the night before and had a not so great experience, check out my review for that! Anywhoo, the price was cheap for the night of, I would recommend the app to anyone! Great is you want to not be on a schedule or are feeling a little spontaneous. The room was comfy, so was the bed. We wanted a low key night so we walked around the corner to the brew house which is a local bar around the corner and recommended by one of our tour guides. We even rented a movie, free of charge, from the front desk. They had great bathroom products and an excellent brunch in the morning! We will definitely make this our go-to hotel in SB!"}

As good (and homemade) as it was, I had a hard time swallowing $31 for 2 sandwiches and 2 bowls of soup. Just a touch too expensive. If it wasn't so much, I would have easily given it 5 stars. \n\nHowever if you're looking for a good and wholesome meal, give this place a try!"}

The ingrdedients, the crust, just everything together makes this my go to pizza.\n\nI will say the wait time does take a little longer than I would like But for what I'm getting, it's definitely worth it. \n\nThe restaurant is a cute fever dream of large mushrooms and trippy colors. I definitely like to stay and eat so my pizza is fresh out the kitchen but taking it to go is fine as well, the pizza will hold. \n\nIf you are from out of town or haven't been to a mellow mushroom, definitely stop by!"}

Our tour took about two hours and covered many things from history, culture, food, etc. I enjoyed it so much that I did not mind the fact that it was pouring down raining. The only negative was that we did not get to meet the voodoo bone lady herself."}
{"input": "I've lived near this place for many years. But there are tons of pizza and sandwich places in this area. It's saturated. I know we tried the pizza years ago and were disappointed. Tonight we got pizza steaks and they were fabulous. Soft rill, packed with meat, right amount of cheese and perfect sauce. I'm really impressed and we'll definitely order from them again."}
{"input": "Well done Saint Louis. I didn't dream of having a Boiling Crab-esque restaurant out here, but here I am. Mad Crab met my expectations and then some. The \"whole shabang\" (aka: whole shebang) medium and mild seasoning was amazing! The half dozen oysters tasted beautifully fresh and the staff were gracious in my requests for salt and pepper and hella limes.\n\nI think this is a great first date place! Take advantage of the fact that you and your date can get messy together in a fun and casual setting! And, if he/she doesn't like cajun seafood, you know they're not the one!\n\nMy advice to the management, if they read reviews, is to have their wait staff add that extra human touch by tying the bibs for their customers. Boiling Crab does that and that extra little service goes a long way. In addition, consider providing wet wipes for their customers with their check.\n\nOverall, well done and I'll be sure to recommend Mad Crab to my Saint Louis friends."}

The atmosphere and space are really neat and could adapt easily to a girls' lunch, business lunch, or romantic dinner. \n\nI started with a tequila cocktail which was absolutely beautiful and refreshing. For lunch, I had the Korean chicken sandwich. The fries were incredible; they must have been fried twice because they were super crisp. I definitely over-ate because the meal was so delicious.\n\nJJ, my server, was also super friendly.\n\nI'd recommend Hemingway's for a variety of occasions! I'm sure you wouldn't get tired of the cocktails or food."}
{"input": "For the price, the motel was a good buy. Like most older motels, the walls are thin. There is a wonderful Italian deli/restaurant about two blocks past Motel 6. Restaurant is called Via Maestra 42. (It's near the post office.). It would be worth it to stay at this motel to conveniently eat at the VM 42.  Gelato is imported from Milan Italy."}
{"input": "Best Italian restaurant I've been to outside of Italy. Service was impeccable. Charcuterie board perfection. Meatballs to die for. Everything about this place is amazing, down to the music selection. GO HERE."}
{"input": "Not one to give rave reviews, but this place deserves it. Customer service was phenomenal, gelato was even better. We sampled a few favors before settling in on two. Everything we sampled was good and it was too hard too decide! The employee also explained to us the story of how they were founded, which added to the experience. So if you're on Central and have a sweet tooth, this is definitely a good place to go!"}
{"input": "Great place., friendly staff and great working hours. Snow, rain or any kind of weather, stories opened on time. I love their egg and croissant sandwich and of course, it is Dunkin brands.\n\nPlace is kept well and sometime they treat their customer well by giving free donuts and munchkins."}
{"input": "I come here to ship materials for work and I've never had any issues. While this location may be understaffed, I think the staff they DO have is very friendly and patient. Others have commented that it takes \"forever\" to ship anything out. I get it. We're all busy people. But taking 8 minutes to fill out forms, weighing and wrapping a package seems about right to me."}
{"input": "Rooms were clean. The hotel is right across a cable car stop so it's convenient to get on it and head to Bourbon street. \n\nParking is located behind the hotel and its secure. You can't get in without the hotel card. \n\nBreakfast is included at the stay, but honestly wasn't that great."}
{"input": "Best Korean food  in Nashville area to date. The side dishes are always fresh and grilled meats have a nice smoked flavor. The service is lacking here . If you seat in the private room, don't expect to see the wait staff much."}
{"input": "Good beer menu and great food options.  The chicken fingers are killer, especially with the Mac's House gravy fries.  If you see the Sweet D's Sausage & P's on the special's menu pounce on that."}
{"input": "Best Italian restaurant there is.  I always get the tomato bread or wings as an app, brandy cream sauce with spinach, and If I have room, I'll get their cheesecake or tiramisu.  Don't forget your wine, its byob.  Try their seafood specials if you get the chance.  I love them!  Service and ambiance is nice too, kinda diner-ish, but good for a date or family night."}
{"input": "I will start by saying I love the layout of this place. They also have a good variety of drinks and food depending on what you are looking for.  However, every time I've been here, the service has left a lot to be desired and caused me to leave earlier than I would have.   \nI had a flight of wine and was planning on getting some food and another drink. But after the initial delivery of my flight, no one checked in with me for the next 45 minutes.   I had even mentioned I was thinking about food. \nThis is the second time I've had this sort of experience here.  Hopefully it improves."}
{"input": "My sister and I stopped in a couple of weeks ago.  On the weekend, we were driving and wondering where to go to get a bite to eat. I was telling her that I was was craving a crepe.  She suggested trying The Creperie.  We found our new favorite place.  We ended up ordering both savory and sweet crepes, yummy.  The service was good, too.  I highly recommend them."}
{"input": "I always walk pass this place but decided to finally give it a try because of the reviews and the price. Overall, as someone already stated they have great apps but the entrees are left to be desired.\nConsidering each entree costs ~$8, you get what you pay for. I ordered the Pad Thai and it was bad. Way too sweet with no spicy kick to it. We also ordered the Seafood Crispy Noodles, Pearl Noodles, and a Beef rice dish. All were really mediocre. The Indian pancakes and chicken satay apps were great though. Idk why the entrees were so lackluster. I'm sad I didn't enjoy it more but I'm glad the total was cheap for a night out."}
{"input": "I stayed here 2 nights. I'm not sure if they upped the quality here since the previous reviews or if people are just hard to please. My colleague and I had 2 rooms reserved, no issues there. The staff was very friendly and even let us do a late check out due to not knowing if we would need it another night or not. Both rooms were clean with fresh linens, pillows, and towels. Had 2 bars of soap, shampoo, conditioner, mouth wash, make up/face wash towelette, and a shower cap. Nice little desk, nice lg tv, ac/heat worked well also. The breakfast was good and all fruit was fresh as well. Lots of places close by to eat at. The hotel is a little older but I enjoyed my stay very much."}
{"input": "Very nice high end Marriott Hotel.  It is pricey but worth it.  Check out the deals on their website, we got a Labor Day special that included, breakfast, and parking for $199,\n\nBoth side of the hotel have great views.  If you are a Gold Marriott or higher member, you get additional perks that make it so much better.\n\nThe only down side was that everyone and their child, stroller, teenager, grandmother with a Gold Card was in the private lounge and it was a bit of circus.\n\nThe staff was very nice."}
{"input": "I legit just walked into Blaze being 9pm and as soon as I got to the line I was told that they are closed. I'm not sure if this is correct as the hours online and on the front door states that they are open until 10pm daily. I also checked the website before coming into Blaze. This pizzeria is new to the area so I was actually pretty stoked to check them out and unfortunately my first experience is not what I expected. It would have been courteous for them to give me an explanation for their time change on a Tuesday night."}
{"input": "Great selection of teachers and classes. Good for both beginners and advanced. The hot yoga classes are the best!"}
{"input": "The order process for the drive through is a complete failure and waste of time. Currently 4 out of four for not getting the order correct. Missing items every time. Too much playtime in there with the kids. This restaurant performs horrible compared to others. After my complaint, they even admitted it. Visit during the week around 3pm. Continuous failure!!!"}
{"input": "Waitress done a great job and the beer was ice cold with decent prices. Recommend the brick house for watching your next sporting event."}
{"input": "Very friendly and personable service. Grant remembers your name and makes you feel welcome, even if you're an out-of-towner no one knows. Very knowledgable about the beers and very happy to let you sample and ask about your day."}
{"input": "If I were writing this based on my dinner experience, it'd be 4 stars, but we went back for brunch the next day.\n\nDinner:\nGREAT happy hour, we had 3 dozen oysters. The place was clean, efficient, and really good. Shawn (female) was on the ball!\nPros:\nHappy hour drink prices. Oysters were divine (I had the P&J)\nCons:\nI ordered the express, which was rabbit sausage with mustard sauce and noodles...mediocre at best.\n\nBreakfast:\nService was slow as Hell compared to the night. Everyone around us was getting agitated\nPros:\nEggs in a jar was so unique I actually took a photo of it.\nCons:\nMenu was tiny, a mimosa special would help this place out."}
{"input": "My fiance and I went to this restaurant recently with my sister and her husband. I ordered chicken tacos, wasn't too impressed. Everything else was amazing though. The guacomole was presented beautifully and tasted even better. However, this is not a traditional mexican restaurant. They also need more options. No beef Enchiladas? Cmon!\nOur server, Shauna, is my reason for the 5 star review. She was very attentive and informative and quick to get us whatever we needed even while we saw her juggling a few other tables. When I gave some of my suggestions she mentioned that the restaurant is working hard to find its niche, and things are constantly improving. Because of her great attitude and service, my family and I will return to Suegra Tequila Cantina."}
{"input": "It's a crazy place with surprisingly good service, decent food, and the weirdo clientele you would expect in this area. I'm really enjoying this little family reunion with the deadbeat drunk father Oj and the crazy white guy in the corner and his random outbursts."}
{"input": "Been here so many times before and all I can say is the food is really good. A hidden gem in Florissant, it has the best Panang curry around. Haven't been to their sister restaurant yet, but I can't seem to want to move on when I am always so satisfied with their fare here."}
{"input": "Great place,  the staff is friendly and accommodating.  The lobby is quite and you can start relaxing right away.  I will recommend Melissa, she has been great! I can say she has help reduced dramatically my neck and back pain.  She's fantastic!"}
{"input": "Worth the wait and the hype- get the old fashioned buttermilk pancakes with a side of bacon and fruit- I topped my pancakes with bananas and will now die happy. Those pancakes are what dreams are made of!"}
{"input": "very clean establishment. the service was friendly enough, the food was piping hot, and the roti was delicious! good vegetarian options and they label which of their dishes are safe for vegans, gluten-free, lactose-free, etc.\n\nas said by others, this is basically indian fast food. i would recommend it!"}
{"input": "Worst place to shop!   I've never been insulted in my life!!! Prejudice as can be.  I have never been at any store and have been asked to leave my purse outside the dressing room!!! Mind you my purse was no bigger than a 6 inches in size.... Not to mention I am the only one that left my purse...  I don't know about any of you, but purse is somewhat personal just to be left blatantly without anyone watching it.  I truly felt because my color ain't right they thought that I would steal... Hell the place was so unorganized anyways.\n\nPlease the store was in such disarray that you can't find anything at all... Needless to say, I am so disappointed"}
{"input": "The first time I tried this place I was in love.  I had sesame chicken and it was almost the best I've ever had.  So I came here again.  Not good.  I must have been really hungry to think the food here was that good.\n\nThe food is alright and the delivery has always been slow."}
{"input": "Food: mediocre. I ordered the steak frites \"medium well\" but it came practically burned and the steak part was the size of a hot dog, NOT at all like it looks in the yelp pictures!! The whole plate was just fries. \n\nService: may have been the most annoying part. Our waiter took about 20 min to bring us some water, over forty minutes to bring the bread, didn't know what was in the drinks, and in general was not up to par for a \"sophisticated\" kind of restaurant. \n\nAmbiance: cool wall art"}
{"input": "Delicious food ! I personally loved it !!!\n\nI was surprised to see 3-star  reviews here but when I read it I understood the reason . Everyone loved the place, the food but the prices. Let me tell you something. If I don't want to spend $200 for dinner I don't go to Barkley Prime! If I want to get a good quality lunch I don't expect it to be less than $25. Unfortunately life is expensive here in Philadelphia, especially for people with good tastes.  And yes you have to pay $$$ for a good quality meals. So If you are aware of that I'm sure you will totally enjoy SURAYA"}
{"input": "I order the bone in ribeye fit market value. The steak was undercooked and waitress could car less. I will not be returning. Kinda sad because the place had a good vibe!"}
{"input": "Husband wanted a good seafood place while we were visiting the area. So jumped on yelp and came across this little place with great reviews. We were not disappointed. Staff was very nice. Food was some of the best we had in a long time. VERY fresh. From the clams to the fish and chips . the shrimp were huge and cooked perfect.  Looking forward to our next visit to FL. We will make sure to make a special trip to our new little favorite seafood place."}
{"input": "This place is great!  I've had the Pho a few times & the Bánh mì.  Both are fantastic.  I've had some great egg rolls in my life, but these are definitely the best.  Authentic, fresh, & tasty.  What more could you ask for?"}
{"input": "Best donuts around.  You have to try them.  They're always fresh and have a nice variety of not only donuts but muffins too."}
{"input": "I loved coming here when it was in the old location with my mother. Delicious food. The manicotti is creamy, not dry and flaky cheese like most places these days. Since they moved I have come whenever I was down to visit. \n\nThis review is not about food, which is very good, but customer service. I came in a few minutes after closing, with people being served plates, just starting to dig in, not looking like they would leave any time soon. \n\nThey wouldn't seat me. They wouldn't even do take out. I had wanted the special. They probably could have scooped it from the tray. No fuss no muss. I only get here twice a year now. \n\nNot even take out? Really? Guess business is great."}
{"input": "Without a doubt Jimboy's has the best ground beef deep fried tacos in all of Reno.  The are pack full of beef and cheese and talk about a crisp crunch when you bit into them!  Just amazing......   For under $6 you can get two good size tacos and a drink, it's a great lunch value!!!!!!!!!"}
{"input": "Great place and friendly helpful staff!  Found the book I was searching for...which was out of print...in great condition."}
{"input": "Yats is the best Cajun Food that we have ever eaten and is quite economical to enjoy.  The menu is quite eclectic in that they cook each day what they want to cook and put it on a chalkboard.  You just never know what kind of tasty delight you will find on any one day.  This is a regular place to visit for my wife and I."}
{"input": "The last time I was here was when I was in high school at the OLD restaurant (if anyone remembers that).  Very nice set up inside, comfy booths, nice staff.  Our pizza took a little longer than anticipated but was tasty, their presentation was the most intriguing.  They slice the pizza in half and place each half on different tiers to bring out to the table.  Have local crafted beers on tap from Mastry's brewing.   Good selection of food."}
{"input": "Finally got to check out this place over the weekend and was not disappointed!\nCame in for breakfast right after opening at 10AM, service was prompt and thankfully it wasn't too crowded. I imagine that you have to make reservations relatively early given the size of the place and popularity though.\n\nOrdered the Greek coffee for myself which was tiny (not sure if that's how it's supposed to be) but still tasty and unique with the coffee grounds in the cup. My friend ordered the Greek frappe which was creamy and delicious, will definitely get that next time. Got the Shakshouka which smelled amazing and was hearty and rich, especially since I opted for the additional sausage. Was pleasantly surprised by the peppery spiciness. My friend got the Cypress Breakfast which she said was delicious as well. Didn't take too long for the food to come overall but our server was very polite, updated us on food status and refilled our water regularly.\n\nWill definitely be back for the lunch options next time!"}
{"input": "LOVE Lucy's for a quick drink or a yummy breakfast.  Beats the breakfast at the Renaissance across the street where we usually stay.  The menu has a tenderloin & eggs with queso over English muffin, which was a hit two days in a row!"}
{"input": "My go to menu is coconut soup and pad thai with protein. I tried same menu here. \nActually really like their coconut soup. They used enough amount of coconut milk that soup was really creamy and wasn't over powering with herb. I am so used to Americanized thai cuisine that I prefer less herb on my dish except cilantro.\nPat thai was great too. Liked the amount of peanut they used, noodle was chewy and perfect and not too sweet. They gave me generous amount of chicken and white meat wasn't dry so I was very happy with my meal."}
{"input": "Amazing ambiance and flavorful, aromatic coffee. I ordered Americano and my friend got Latte - both perfectly delicious. Cute little spot with eclectic decor which features local artist's work where you can relax, study, read a book or get some work done."}
{"input": "In a word... \"OVERRATED!\".  The food took forever to come out.  The burger was WAY overcooked (Especially when I ordered it Medium Rare) and the Seafood Jumbalaya was Decent.  Not worth the price.  There are better places to eat in the french quarter.  It was not horrible, but for everything that we had heard about this place, I would have expected much better."}
{"input": "4 stars for 1/2 off Burger Tuesdays.\n\npersonal favorites: San Remo and Burger Benedict\nfriends's favorites: Carribean\n\nI come here every Wednesday during the school year. The burger deal is absolutely fantastic, and the burgers are delicious! Copa is usually busiest at noon on Wednesdays. The line is quite long during the school year around noon, and the line dies down after 1:30 pm. Copa is great for 2 people and also great for large parties. They have a basement that's great for accomodating large parties.\n\nThis is a popular lunch spot for the Penn student/faculty community and anyone who works in the Penn medical system."}
{"input": "My husband and I went to Thailand for our honeymoon and we're missing some of that good Thai food -- this place hit the spot PERFECTLY. You get a good amount of food for what you pay, my husband and I ate our fill and both had leftovers for the next day. This place is a hole in the wall kind of place, one of those amazing rare finds. Can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"input": "Aparently this review is for Saguaro East. I didnt realize there were two separate parks. This park is fine. We planned to do some hiking, but it just looked like flat average desert you can easily see and hike in the Phoenix area. The visitor center and staff were nice."}
{"input": "Great breakfast spot. Forget to check-in a lot, but have been coming here for months now. Recommend the biscuits instead of toast. They are delicious. Fruit cups change up what's in them but they are big and fresh. My favorite so far is runny eggs over corned beef hash. The scrapple is great, so are the breakfast potatoes.\n\nToday  I had the grilled pastrami on rye with Swiss and 1,000 dressing. The only thing missing is some sauerkraut. It would be so much better.\n\nThe only breakfast dish I haven't been thrilled about is the sausage biscuit with gravy. The reason is because it's a sausage patty on an amazing biscuit. I wish they just put fresh ground sausage in the gravy instead.\n\nOverall it's a great place, with just a few changes I think it could be amazing and a spot people would travel to."}
{"input": "I have been in Tucson for over 2 years and have tried many nail salons , none of which have inspired a 2nd visit until I experienced Nails by Yen.  I have received  many services (manicures, pedicures, shellac, acrylic) from several of the Nails by Yen family and every time I am ecstatic with the results and how enjoyable my experience is. \n\nI kid you not I have fallen asleep during more than a couple of my pedicures!  If there is ever a tough day I know exactly where to go right after work to turn the day around"}
{"input": "Reliable and trustworthy service.   I was so pleased with everything they did for me and we're so kind and helpful throughout the entire process.   I will most definitely use them many more times!"}
{"input": "I love to come and look around this location for gifts or a treat for myself, especially while sipping on a Starbucks since it is conveniently connected to the book store.  They have a wide variety of books and other knick knacks for gifts.  Staff sometimes seems confused when you ask them questions regarding stock.  Last time a staff member asked me if I needed help and when I went to answer him he started helping someone else, so that was a bit annoying.  All in all I love looking around here."}
{"input": "New to the area and needed some freshening up with a trim and layers.  Wanted a curly look for the night also.  Saw reviews of Megan but was afraid if I asked for her she would be booked.  Luckily when I called they offered me Megan so I grabbed it.  \nSo glad I did!  Megan did exactly what I wanted, curled my hair, told me what she was doing the whole way, and was great to talk to.  Megan is my kind of people ;)  Very happy to have found my new stylist!!!  YES!!!"}
{"input": "Recap: \n\n1. They arrived on time. Early even, as I was still scrambling to put last minute things away. \n2. There were two movers, both of whom were professional and calm, yet friendly and kind (would it be tactless of me to say they were also drop dead gorgeous?!)\n3. They were careful with my things and efficient with their time.\n4. Afterwards, we all sat around and conversed and I found out these guys were really down to earth, intelligent people. I'm happy to have supported this local, hard working company."}
{"input": "Beware the shot girls, they will take your cash....fast.  Very aggressive but outside of that pretty fun."}
{"input": "Food is excellent and fresh everytime I go there. The staff is friendly and the food is just so flavorful. I have brought several people here for the first time and they all love it!"}
{"input": "One of my most favorite Indian restaurants. Nothing fancy but absolutely delicious meals.\n\nNever an issue being seated promptly. A casual dining experience awaits. Service is pleasant. Ambience a bit blahh but still enjoyable.\n\nNow onto the real reason to come here... the FOOD:\nNaan is soft. Garlic is tasty but I usually like the original best.  Regardless of your entree of choice, you really cannot go wrong. And although it does not appeal to my level of spiciness preferred (I like it HOT HOT HOT), it has great flavor and is great for the average spicey food eater. My recommendations are the Masala or Vindaloo (Chicken, Shrimp, Lamb... option is yours). Room for dessert? Order the Rice Pudding  and Gulab Jaman, mix together and enjoy the creamy sugary treat."}
{"input": "Huge oysters when I was there.  Great service!  Had a muffuletta  (half).  It was all very tasty!"}
{"input": "Got an amazing facial from Dianne and a relaxing mani-pedi from Vicki. This place is the perfect balance of peaceful organic spa and skilled, seasoned estheticians that  know their stuff. The products they use are natural, potent, and reasonably priced with a retail area full of products I can't wait to try. Great place just to stop in to buy a quick gift for someone or have a full spa day with all the bells and whistles."}
{"input": "Excellent little old school bakery. Maybe the best coffee cake (aka crumble cake) I've ever had...well worth the $6 (served at least 6 people)."}
{"input": "Only good thing about this place are the fries. The burgers are not that special or great. Ordered the double mushroom and got more mushrooms than burger patty. Almost reminds me of a McDonald's burger patty. Even with 2 patties the burger felt mediocre at best. Greasy mushrooms and a soggy bun. Came out to $12 with drink and fries and still felt hungry afterwards. If you want a real burger and fries, try a true authentic local place."}
{"input": "Exceptional entrees, exceptional service.....and many very healthful options. One of our favorite local venues. Recommended without reservation."}
{"input": "fuck yes. meat, bourbon libations, and a salad (to round things out aka make myself feel better about ingesting the aforementioned two items.) i took myself on an early birthday date with myself and was not disappointed (neither in the food nor the company). i had a medium rare plain burger to see if it was worth all the fuss...no cheese, bacon, dressing, etc to disguise the quality of the meat. (of course, no bread either since i'm gluten free.) the burger was great - perfectly cooked and seasoned... though, i felt like a bit of a freak sitting at the bar eating my burger with a knife and a fork. i'd like to come back to try a fancypants burger since the extras look pretty tasty.  the salad was so-so; it was no frills with the perfect amount of dressing. the bartender-cum-waiter was super attentive but not cloyingly so. he made delicious sazeracs to accompany my repast."}
{"input": "I love this place.  Everything I've had seems really fresh.  The hummus is really tasty and the ambiance is nice and relaxed."}
{"input": "What a great find in Meridian! I walked in and was greeted instantly! The customer service was amazing. They helped me pick out just the right things! Can't wait to go back again! Will be my new go to boutique for clothes and gifts!"}
{"input": "Awesome tour! This is a definite must do when visiting the St. Louis area. The Tour Guides were fun and made the tour not just entertaining but interesting as well."}
{"input": "Amazing meal. Appetizers were delicious. All the steaks including the filet & carne asada were flavorful and tender. All the sides are family size so sharing is a must. Topped it off with the sampler board for dessert. An assortment of all the desserts on a mini board. Definitely recommend."}
{"input": "If you love waiting forever for ice cream in a cup because the employees enjoy standing around talking rather than working then this is your place! I ordered one thing, which I got, then waited several minutes for just a simple ice cream in a cup. 5 employees sat around talking to each other. I get it, working with friends is fun but when there's customers waiting for food, especially simple orders, it needs to be taken care of. Not to mention they brought the wrong thing out, and when I corrected them, I still waited several more minutes for ice cream in a cup. The order taker did apologize for the wait before I ordered but with 5 employees working I'd imagine they could've been able to take an order without waiting for the person up next to leave. I've worked in tons of restaurants before and if it was up to me I'd implement some serious re-training, especially based on similar reviews."}
{"input": "I used go to Grace Nails and made the switch when Epic opened up.  I have had nothing but great experiences! I got my nails done yesterday and my thumb nail chipped so I returned today to get the fixed. They put another coat on all of them and fixed 3 nails completely at no charge.  I've always been impressed by their work but their service is awesome as well!  They have a client for as long as I have nails to paint :)"}
{"input": "Fresh food and creative dishes. The service was good and the seating was comfortable. The orange juice is awesome. I was very pleased with the made to order hash."}
{"input": "DO NOT GO THERE . The male waiter was only looking at my 7 year old daughter and I tried to get his attention  away but couldn't, a real creeper. The cook in the back looked in our direction and laughed. Will never go back  . Horrible place. please help to rip those guys a new one."}
{"input": "My family recently purchased a 2015 Mazda CX-5 from this dealership.  They had a large selection, and after looking over quite a few we made our choice.  The price was within our predetermined range, and the sales staff were not pushy at all.  We looked at other small SUVs, or Crossovers as they are called, around Reno and felt there was very little difference in the various makes.  We decided on the Mazda because of the Dolan's family's history of giving back to the community.  We couldn't be more pleased with the vehicle."}
{"input": "Service was ok. Good deals. But the staff was very loud and unprofessional. They were the loudest in the restaurant. Eating while working. Just being generally obnoxious. Will not be going back."}
{"input": "The Mona Lisa Lounge is an awesome spot and gem here in Louisiana. My boyfriend and I stopped to have a couple drinks before our swamp tour. Not only were we greeted with the best southern hospitality the service, food, and drinks were superb. The Bourdain and seafood balls were incredible. The cook came out to serve us personally. We were given beads and plenty of great conversation. The owner Tony was personable and genuinely wanted us to enjoy ourselves and that we did. This will become a staple in my visits to Louisiana."}
{"input": "Prices are high, but the service is awesome.  Sales people know their stuff.  Very helpful if you are looking for a specific item.\n\nJ Crew has a lot of things that are exclusive to J Crew but made by other companies.  I like a pair of navy sperrys they have there.  Cool ties and items for men who know how to dress well.  Awesome store, I wish I could afford more!  Keep in mind 15% teacher discount!!!"}
{"input": "Food was just about ok. Service very average and slow. Also, charging extra for something as simple as soy sauce is a bit strange when their other condiments were complimentary. Bar staff was good though."}
{"input": "First time we've been here.  The bar tender was great and steered us to some great eats.  Had the sweet potato fries which were great, I had a Trident burger and onion rings.  It was huge and very good.  Wife had fish and chips.  Nice breading and fries were great.\n\nWe'll be back."}
{"input": "Xtreme Tacos has become one of my favorite places. Everything I have ever ordered has been DELICIOUS! We have probably gotten food between 8-10 times. I have e joyed everything! For sure, always have to get chips. Their homemade chips are to die for!! The salsa and quest are both excellent for dipping. \nBesides the delicious food, the people who work there are Xtremely friendly and helpful. The guy who is usually at the counter is so warm and welcoming!"}
{"input": "I have to say it was....mediocre. really nothing more. \n\nYes, the live music was enjoyable but thats really the best I can give it.\n\nThe food was....food. nothing really special in my opinion. My boyfriend had the filet mignon and didn't really even finish it. he also tried the potatoes au gratin and said it tasted almost as though they used easy-mac cheese on them. \nI had the vegetable platter and thats all it was. I have experienced amazing vegetable sides at other restaurants, but this entree was nothing to write home about.\n\nAs for desserts he had the cheesecake, which was fine, not amazing but nothing bad to say about it either. I had the strawberries and once again, thats all it was. Don't expext them to come out plated amazingly or even with whipped cream, they're only sliced strawberries.\n\nHonestly, for the money I don't think it was worth it. I can think of many other places in the city, some of which are much cheaper, that are much more worth your time."}
{"input": "We arrived extremely late and had to book last minute because our air b&b was a no show. The front desk were extremely helpful and friendly. Breakfast is pretty good worth $12. Location at first might not seem as ideal as downtown but right down the road are 4 star restaurants and awesome dive bars where you get the newer Nashville feel. I recommend doing the pub trolley down the road and get a tour of the recording studios only a block away. Perfect location $5 uber or free shuttle ride to downtown tootsies. Definitely staying here next time in town."}
{"input": "We went at the recommendation of a friend.  We got the beef carpaccio, burger, and truffle fries.  It was a great experience ans it definitely met my high expectations for the place.  These was a wait of 40 min for a walk in but it was cool since Cycle Brewing was right across the street :).  Make sure to call in if you don't want to wait but they also have a neat waiting room that used to be a hotel lobby."}
{"input": "Staff member wouldn't let us use guest pass on our first time there. He said our only option was to buy at least a one day pass for $15/person. LOL. Went to Retro fitness for free trial; better equipment and environment:)"}
{"input": "Just found my new favorite place for pizza, didn't get any of the pizzas listed on the menu, built our own. Pepperoni, sliced red onions, roasted garlic. Was perfect, not too much cheese, the right amount of pepperoni, onions weren't over powering, and the garlic...oh yes, not your run of the mill minced garlic, but cloves of roasted garlic. All their pizzas are 10\", perfect amount for two, didn't try any of the appetizers, but I'm going to do their survey, and get one for free. Looking forward on going back....real soon."}
{"input": "We really enjoyed our visit to Pizzeria Vetri.  The group split four pies, Margherita, Crudo, Quattro Formaggi and Renato.  They all tasted great, I think the Margherita and Crudo were our two favorites.  Good beer selection and the Fried Pizza Dough dessert was a nice ending to fun night out.  \n\nPV is quite small with little waiting space, the bar Kite & Key across the street is a good spot to wait and have a drink."}
{"input": "Awesome park for a variety of ages. Fenced in play area. No dogs allowed (sorry). Bonus is that you get to watch small aircraft takeoff every couple minutes (could be perceived as a disadvantage I suppose but is ultimately a good thing for small kids who are obsessed with airplanes)."}
{"input": "Great food & pleasant service.  Would order any of our dishes again & staff Robert & Gregory were both very entertaining but not overbearing."}
{"input": "Gets two stars because the service was great and staff was very friendly, food was not very good.. maybe we came on a bad day. I ate there and ordered a togo item for my husband. I asked the girl working the counter to pick the most popular thing out of the German section for him and it was literally just a pretzel and a piece of sausage in a box."}
{"input": "dont let the entrance scare you, awesome place! Volcano and Sexy man!!!!!!!!"}
{"input": "Super happy there is FINALLY a place in the city doing smoothie bowls. They only use an acai base. More like a sorbet. It is tasty and doesn't melt as quickly as a typical smoothie bowl. The bowls are topped with whatever you want. I had the PBJ bowl with bananas and nutella added. I wish they had a pitaya base as well, like Frutta Bowls and Playa Bowls. Overall this place delicious and I can't wait to try some of the smoothies ."}
{"input": "Was rather disappointed in the service.  We found our own table as requested to do but wait staff continually walked by without even acknowledging us.  After ordering a flight of their beers, again it was a long wait.  Not impressed by any of the beers.  One even tasted like soap.  Have tried other flights at other breweries and find it a great way to pick a favorite.  But not here."}
{"input": "In Brentwood for work this week and I came here based on the previews. The food is good but that's all, good. Nor great... mediocre beef burrito bowl. Place and process similar to a Chipotle but my vote would go to Chipotle."}
{"input": "A big disappointment.  It began to rain heavily soon after boarding and we had a difficult time finding a dry place to sit while we waited for our assigned dinner time.  The lines for the bar were long, and our dinner was mediocre.  We were seated too far from the band to enjoy the music, and the staff seemed to be very disorganized.  For the price we paid, I had higher expectations."}
{"input": "We had a group of 11, we couldn't sit together because they do not accommodate for larger groups. We had to wait many times for our waitress to come back to fill drinks. Our food at the table of 5 came out 30 minutes before the food for the group of 6 even got their salad.  Our waitress never took our empty plates, which compiled a mess. Usually happy with Texas Roadhouse but this experience will make me think twice before coming back."}
{"input": "Rude. Had me wait while they took other people. I just let my daughter get her nails done. I paid and she put my money on the counter and moved her head to look behind me to ask the lady she is ready. So I sat and watched her take the next lady and her money. Well she thanked her for business and gave her money in her hand bottom line. So now I can say it's a racist business!!!!! I watched them greet everyone and thank them for their business. BUT ME. They won't get another dollar from me or anyone I know."}
{"input": "The Piasa Bird is a large painting on a cliff face on the Mississippi River just north of Alton.  The original paintings were discovered in the 17th century, but were destroyed.  The bird was repainted and later restored in its current location.  The legend of the Piasa Bird is likely a concoction of an American writer, and the original paintings may not have even been birds.  However, the Piasa Bird is a part of local tradition and a must-see for anyone traveling on the Great River Road.  And bird watchers that travel the road to see bald eagles in the winter will surely want to add the Piasa Bird to their life list."}
{"input": "Our intention was to go to Rooster.. but the wait at noon on a Sunday was 45 minutes.. crazy. So I pulled out Yelp to see what other downtown options I have and it suggested Blondie's. I love the laid back attitude and funky furniture. Boyfriend had a bagel and cream cheese and a blueberry pancake off the kids menu. He enjoyed himself.. I had the banana french toast.. very good but very sweet.. I think I would have enjoyed this as a half order and had something savory as well. \nLoved the bottle service for mimosa's. Had a $25 bottle of champagne and unlimited orange juice (great juice!). We will be back for sure!"}
{"input": "This is the most inefficient operation I've ever seen. We waited in line for over an hour and the women working the desk were very rude."}
{"input": "Excellent tasty hamburgers and especially their steak fajitas.\nVery friendly service. Great bargains in drink at happy hour."}
{"input": "So yummy! Great selection of toppings.  The owner is really nice and it's super clean in there!"}
{"input": "The Pho Ga here is excellent best I've had outside of Vietnam.  The service is not so great.  All the food (appetizers, entrees, etc) came to the table at the same time with the exception of one of our companion's entree (he had to wait quite a while) .  The waitress apologized, but it was still a bit frustrating.  Communication with staff can be an issue as most are non-native english speakers so we had to work a little at getting the everything sorted out.  \n\nDespite the problems, I will definitely return.  If you don't have patience, don't go.  If you do, you will enjoy a great vietnamese meal."}
{"input": "Didn't love it, didn't hate it.  The ingredients get lost in the pizza and it almost seems bland because the flavors don't stand out.  The price and delivery time are on par though so if you're hungry, lazy and broke, call 'em."}
{"input": "Pretty good beer list but the service is terrible. Waited 15 minutes for a beer and then another 15 for check. Go across the street if you want a full meal and full service."}
{"input": "Great food, friendly staff. I wasn't feeling adventurous for my first visit, so went with my favorite: Rueben on marble rye. Really good. Corned beef well-seasoned and piled high. Other ingredients were perfect. Easily two meals, their sandwiches are quite large, thank goodness since I thought almost $10 was a bit pricey. Place was packed for lunch but staff remained calm & friendly as they went about their business. Took mine to-go and it was packaged well ( in butcher paper ) and was still warm and not soggy when I got home. Will go again, with hubby next time since I think he'll enjoy their food."}
{"input": "Consistent quality and service.  Love the #1 Deluxe.  Props to Amanda for excellent customer service, above and beyond!"}
{"input": "I've been in a few times now and I need to get my review in. Love this spot. Located right next door to my favorite homebrew shop, Great Fermentations, Bier is always a good time. They have growler fills every weekend with a huge line up each time. From the DFG to the Pumpkin ale, they always impress. Only issue I have is that when itry their beers outside of the brewery, I get something off. Maybe the beer line? I don't know but I sure do enjoy their pint nights! Those are every third Friday of the month. They always have some yummy food truck or restaurant come in to serve up the masses. Stop in and see why they have won the state fair brewers cup a few times."}
{"input": "I'm sorry El Sol De Tala.  You lost a star.  The guac was not as good this time around.  The service is still outstanding.  Maybe the avocados were not ripe?"}
{"input": "This place was ok. The parking is free which is honestly unheard of in this area so that was good. Couple things that weren't good were that I reserved a concierge level room and when I got there was told there weren't any available but I got concierge access with a normal room. Interesting though as several folks checked in after me and got rooms on that level. I did check out the concierge lounge and it was TINY, i mean like closet sized so not sure it's worth it to pay more for that anyway. Also my keys didn't work to come from parking the car to the hotel so I had to walk down 3 ramps to go to the main entrance... when i told the front desk she was like ok and that was it. Wifi was good but I'll definitely stick with Marriott."}
{"input": "Service sucks here around noon been waiting over an hour for a simple breakfast for 2. The food smells great if I could only damn well eat it. Like for real I've seen like 4 groups walk in order, eat and leave and we haven't got anything yet."}
{"input": "We had dinner here about 10 days ago when I visited my sister in philly.  I was very impressed with the food, presentation, decor and service.  We had A LOT of food; tempura udon, dragon roll, tempura shrimp roll, salmon sashimi, this sashimi trio, popcorn shrimp, etc.  Everything was so fresh and tasty.  My favorite was the popcorn shrimp.  Soooooo delicious!!  If only there's a restaurant like this in New York.  Great value for the money!"}
{"input": "I have visited the brewpub several times now, and I'm finally ready to write up a review.  I really like the decor here.  It's old-school brewpub with lots of games for children.  The beer is pretty good.  I wish they would do some more adventurous offerings, but I can still get a good beer here.  \nThe food can be a mixed bag.  I had a small pizza that was a gooey mess (mushrooms and hearty toppings need a thick crust for stability).  I love all the scotch egg offerings (you can get it on a pizza or burger here), but they are so salty.  The burgers are good. The desserts are great (please get the frangipane).  It's also great to get the ploughman's plate and a beer, and just relax for a bit."}
{"input": "Great food and awesome service. There's normally a wait, but a seat at the bar is the best seat in the house, in my opinion. Awesome happy hour too!"}
{"input": "Really loud live music...but a much more subdued bar on the second floor where you can actually hold a conversation."}
{"input": "This place was awesome! I am driving cross country and hit a busted tire on the road and something came off the bottom of my car.  I called and Brian told me to come in and he would take a look.  They put my car up right away and patched things up. He was really nice and had me on my way in less than 30 minutes.  Definitely recommend this place."}
{"input": "It is what you expect in an Acme, the only thing I found a little different with this one is that it seemed the aisles were a little narrower than in other stores. Store is a little smaller than others so not as wide of a variety, but was fine, looks like they've upgraded some areas like the frozen/refrigerated food sections. Service was fine."}
{"input": "One of my favorite breakfast joints in Nash! Love bringing fam here when I have them in town! Amazing bloody Mary's & biscuits! Well worth the wait, always!!"}
{"input": "Amazing Food and great prices. We eat here at least once a week! \n\nChow mei fun is amazing but so is the sushi! They also don't mind customizing your order if you like it Spicy it prefer it more on the savory side. My wife had the volcano roll and wasn't disappointed!"}
{"input": "Food is terrible and too expensive for how bad it is. Took over 2 hours for delivery. Rude on the phone when we called to see about our order status. Terrible decision to order from this place, never again."}
{"input": "Went with a large group and the service was decent. I ordered the Swedish pancakes but the waitress gave me the wrong one. I didn't realize it until another person who ordered Swedish pancakes got theirs.... which looks way different than mine.  They mistakenly gave me blueberry pancakes.  It was too late to argue because I was already half way done eating it.  I was hungry.  Overall, the food tasted average.  Not really worth waiting in line.  I would recommend other diners if u don't want to wait in line."}
{"input": "I've been coming to this restaurant since I was a kid and recently had a business lunch here and found the food to be the same, delicious! The décor isn't one to write home about, primarily greenish booths that can be a little tight for those with a belly.  But I must say it looks better now than it did 25 years ago.\n\nThe menu has lots of items; soup, noodles, rice, and entrees and most under $10.  They give you a pen and paper to write down your order and we ordered 2 items using the menu number.  The black bean rice noodles came with lots of sauce and vegetables.  My colleague ordered the seafood with vegetables which had shrimp, fried squid, and squid.  Both of the dishes were good, but I liked the noodles better.\n\nThe prices are cheap, and our meal came to $20 with leftovers too! Come for the good food and don't expect much for service or atmosphere.  Or you could also order take out if you don't want to eat it.  They only take cash though but there's at ATM in the restaurant."}
{"input": "Nice atmosphere & good drinks. Kind of hard to find since its sort of hidden. They have a cool fire pit to sit around and enjoy your night."}
{"input": "I ordered the chicken stew, it was Tasteless chicken, it was a fried chicken possibly a leftover, that was thrown into a pot and made it into a stew.  If I wanted leftovers, I would have eaten at home.  Gross, still feel like I have to throw up."}
{"input": "The staff is nice and very friendly, but the wine selection is not the best and the food is not something you would order again. Nothing really stood out. This place has nothing good unique to offer."}
{"input": "Very cute and quaint inside, of course what else can you expect from a location inside Eagle Village! The service was very good and the food was good too. Overall I had a very pleasant brunch experience with my friend."}
{"input": "My boyfriend and I needed a quick bite and wanted some solid pizza. We were not disappointed. This place was so good. The pizza slices are HUGE and they put so much toppings on speciality slices you will not be disappointed. Oh and the mozz sticks are perfect !!! I recommend x10 for some solid pizza etc in philly, cute little place, love the local feels."}
{"input": "I went to college around the area, so I loved Corner Bakery. I would always get the Cobb Salad, so I returned to reminisce. Unfortunately, either my taste buds changed or their chefs got bad. It is a mediocre spot, similar to Panera and Cosi."}
{"input": "It is hard to find anything wrong with Brew Brothers in downtown Reno. They are one of the older brewpubs in the region located between the Eldorado and Silver Legacy with a large and upscale bar and restaurant open whenever you need them.\n\nThe beer is a big focus here with the brewing equipment showcased behind the large bar. They have many styles of beer including some of the newer popular IPA, although I chose their standard ale. The bar was nice with alternating poker and non-poker seating and excellent happy hour specials. I had to leave early for a dinner reservation, but the place was great.\n\nI would definitely return to Brew Brothers for a beer or meal while visiting the downtown Reno casino complex. This is a nice place to have a cold beer and relax for a few minutes."}
{"input": "It's a nice two-leveled tavern, right across from Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fries and besides it being a little on the spicy side (for me - I have a very low heat tolerance) it was very satisfying! The service was speedy and the atmosphere was relaxed (of course, this was before the lunch rush) but I would recommend for anyone in the area."}
{"input": "This gym has everything you could want but it just feels like something is missing. It might just be too pricey for my taste, but if you can afford a place like this then it may be for you. Just feels like money goes into the wrong things when a lot of equipment could be improved. The pool is a nice amenity as is the sauna/steam room. The classes leave much to be desired."}
{"input": "The Dosa is pretty decent but honestly the smoke really made my head hurt and made me cough. Made me feel pretty miserable and not hungry. Slow service, restaurant not clean."}
{"input": "This place was delicious! The onion rings were nice and crispy, the fries were well seasoned, and the burger was on point. I will definitely be back for a milksahke."}
{"input": "The food was excellent! don't let the rating discourage you. Everything we ordered was great. The outside patio was also really pleasant and the service was really good too!\""}
{"input": "I like this place. The server was great. The food was good. The whipped feta was great. The pretzels were good and warm. The fish and chips were crispy and hot. The Garcia pizza was eehhhh.. It needed something like salt or parm cheese. Idk but it lacked some flavor. I tried a beermosa which was odd but not bad. The menu is extensive and had many vegetarian options."}
{"input": "I LOVE this place!  I have been coming here for a few years now.  Its a little funky, and I would never order say the escargot, for safety reasons, but when it comes to lots of Saki, great rolls, and mountains of rice and Sashimi, this is the way to go.  Young atmosphere, loud dance music, and SAKI!"}
{"input": "The vegan pecan turtle bar was by far the BEST vegan baked good I have ever consumed. My non-vegan girlfriend was also impressed. She also loved the poptart that they recommended for her. If they added more vegan options to their daily menu, I would not complain!!"}
{"input": "This is our first time here.  There are several inflatables for the kids to use,  6 total, as well as an additional 1 set aside for toddlers. There is also an inflated pillow to jump on. Adults are allowed to \"play\" on inflatables as long as children aren't in danger of being ran over.  We will be back again.  As for location and price it's not to bad!"}
{"input": "This is THE place to go in Nashville for Vietnamese!  No frills, family-run Vietnamese food that is simply great tasting.  Other places seem \"Americanized\" to me, but not KG.\n\nDo not miss the spring rolls.  The Pho is particularly good, and the Bun bowls are excellent.  I'm also a big fan of the \"Pork chop lunch special\", but don't plan on needing to eat dinner afterward.  Finally, they make a mean lemongrass chicken meal."}
{"input": "I went to Spasso the other night with some friends. All four of us were SO pleased with our experience and our meals! We each had something different. I had the special for the evening, which was seafood (jumbo shrimp and jumbo lump crab) over pappardelle with tomato and asparagus. it was to die for, and my leftovers the next day were just as tasty :) service was amazing and wine was perfect. I live on state street and can't wait to visit again very soon!!"}
{"input": "I've only had the cannolis here but they are awesome! They're freshly filled when ordered and the filling is phenomenal. Not too sweet, it's perfect. If you like cannoli, if you don't think you like cannoli, you should definitely get one from Termini Bros."}
{"input": "We had such a great time. Pat, the owner, reserved a couple bikes for us on Labor Day weekend and off we went! Cruised the harbor and up the hill to the park with very little effort. Stopped off for lunch and we had zero stress because Pat supplied a bike lock. Went into the Funk Zone and some wine tasting. While everyone else was on foot...we were able to cover major ground and we breezed through traffic. Recommend highly and we will do it again as we visit here often. We had a lot of fun."}
{"input": "Brought my 4Runner to replace catalyst converter. Within a few hours I was back on the road. Great service.  Definitely recommend to any friend."}
{"input": "Be prepared to feel like a kid in a candy store!\n\nI come here every once in awhile, and am always overwhelmed by their selection. A mixed six packed or two can make for a great evening. (And present, I bought one for my roommate's boyfriend's bday one year.) \n\nStaff is friendly and helpful, and they do have a deli for light food. \nNote, they do not post prices on the beers, or in the fridge--you must look it up in the manifest, so you may be surprised at the price when you get to the register. --Just put one back or swap it out for something cheaper ;)"}
{"input": "All my co-workers loved this place....since my company was next to the place...all I smell was food from Han Dynasty around lunch hour. I finally took the chance to tried it with my co-worker and i was some what disappointed. I didn't go for any of the spicy stuff but I really did not enjoy it. We ate outside which is probably not the best idea since there were non-stop cars driving by but the food was not as good as i expected to be. Perhaps, I should try the spicy dished next time when I find the courage to go again!!!"}
{"input": "Beautifully sweet ending to a sweet trip to NOLA with the girls. We stumbled upon this after a delicous savory lunch nearby at Cochon (review to follow). Sweet Confections is on Magazine St, around corner from the art gallery strip on Julia St.   We had a sampling of cupcake (chocolate with mocha filling) and truffles (raspberry, creme brulee, and orange).  Cupcake was good, mocha filling best part. Rasberry truffle was my fav, love the dark chocolate so it's not cloyingly sweet. The coffee was a wonderful chaser, not overly burnt, smoky, or acidic... I usually have coffee with milk n sugar, forgot this time, but I didn't even need it!  Seating was nice, with a few cafe tables inside. Enough for our 6-girl troop. And service was great, helpful with flavor suggestions and labelling.  Gave 4 of 5 stars because maybe they could benefit from one more equally gracious staff person."}
{"input": "The idea is cool,  but the tacos were a bit of a disappointment. We got the chicken, carne asada and fish tacos. The chicken was dry and carne asada was salty so it wasn't full of flavor. The fish taco was good, though! Tender, juicy, and crispy! I don't think the tacos are worth the price, especially since tacos are supposed to be a cheap, simple and delicious food. Overall, I wouldn't go back but it is a cool atmosphere and right in downtown which is convenient."}
{"input": "First time in New Orleans. \nThis place was recommended by a coworker, and it w as excellent! A half portion is perfect for lunch, and the food is off the wall good! Raspberry tea is real raspberry....the service was excellent, waitress was friendly, and made good suggestions when asked about what was best on the menu. \n\nWould I go back? Yep. Small place, but well worth it."}
{"input": "I'm definitely a beginner when it comes to yoga but wanted to give it a try, and I'm glad I started here. Everyone is so nice and welcoming and the classes are extremely helpful. The instructors give a lot of personal attention to everyone in the class, which is extremely nice for beginners like me as well. I highly recommend trying one of the hot yoga classes one night for an awesome, sweaty workout."}
{"input": "Dog friendly and good selection of food and drinks. Cute outdoor patio. \n\nWe ordered the Nook Burger and Crab Cakes with slaw. \nBoth were delicious. I would come back again when in the area."}
{"input": "I love Natural Cafe! Delicious and fresh food and you can get anything from salads to pasta to salmon, rice, and veggies. I also love the environment and the little flowers they have on every table. I've had a few subpar interactions with the employees there but nothing to stop me from coming back."}
{"input": "I recently spent 2 nights here and have stayed a couple of other times too. I like the place,  the grounds are nice, the pool and spa are great after a day at the wineries.  All the rooms have a balcony or patio to relax on, they have a fire pit to enjoy a glass of wine by. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable,  the room also had a microwave and a fridge. It's a fairly short drive to get downtown,  there's a shopping mall across the street and restaurants nearby. I certainly will stay here again. Santa Barbara is pricy but I got a good deal through Expedia on the room."}
{"input": "Fun fun place.  Service is always friendly not always fast. But always friendly and the good is pretty darn good"}
{"input": "to many changes to an awesome place has made bottle works a thing of the past for me.  removing favorites from the menu.  raising prices.  and promoting only buying local whilst not using items not produced in house as a new goal are very confusing.  sad to see this happen"}
{"input": "Shoutout to Alyssa for transforming my brows! Over the past 3 years, she has always listened to my concerns and delivered exceptional service. My brows are fuller and I have a nice shape that I can easily maintain.\n\nI was hoping I could post a picture in this review but I don't see an option for that so hopefully it gets uploaded to Alston Face & Body photos. Check it out - I'm wearing my sunnies in my car and it's just after seeing Alyssa! :) \n\nAs for the rest of the team, everyone is super nice, talented and helpful!"}
{"input": "This was such a unique spot, from the graffiti style art on the walls to the delicious food options and special hummus flavors. Good prices, great portion size. I had the greek steak pita with guac hummus. Will definitely be back!"}
{"input": "we had a groupon and so we went - great lobsters (although they were out of a few sizes this evening) but they were delicious and our waitress Jessica was very attending and nice - made some good suggestions.\n\nnot fancy but good lobster."}
{"input": "Carne Seca burro was smokey, delicious and really filling. The price is great for what they give you. If only they automatically put some tomatoes and lettuce. :( Other than that, you have to stop by and try the carne seca burro, especially if you're just visiting the area. The tortilla is amazing - if I wasn't in the process of moving, I would have taken a few back home to eat. Don't forget to order an horchada - they serve one that is delicious!"}
{"input": "I (think I) had a very good time at Dirty Frank's. I remember being happy with my drink, the decor, the clientele, and the cleanliness of the bathrooms. I can't think of anything wrong with my experience there. I definitely plan to return when I can better appreciate it."}
{"input": "What a fantastic venue- for a wedding and reception!\nThe staff was very attentive and did an excellent job at keeping on schedule!\nI highly recommend for a wedding/reception!\nOh- the glass demonstration was such a great event - in between the wedding and the reception/dinner!!\n5 stars is not enough!!! I rate it 10 stars!\nExcellent!!!"}
{"input": "The Lemon Cake is as good as it is heavy.    It was my second visit to Cake Life and I only chose not to get cupcakes because it would have been pure gluttony.   They ROCK!   Many more visits to come."}
{"input": "Maybe I'll write an updated review bc I really want to try it again but from hearing other people talk about this place, I wasn't that impressed. I got the creole strawberry which tasted like vanilla ice cream with some strawberries (which didn't even taste \"in season\"). I should have tried some of their other flavors. Maybe next time."}
{"input": "The atmosphere & food were superb! Our server was a tad sketchy, shorting us on change thinking we wouldn't notice & he wasn't super attentive or fast BUT the rest of the staff were super friendly & helpful! We'll def return, we just hope we get a different server next time lol."}
{"input": "They have good nonpariel cookies."}
{"input": "This is, without a question, my favorite place to dance in Philadelphia. They always have great DJs or live music lined up. Chang Chang here was bumpin. \n\nThe Barb constantly has ridiculous drink specials, and they usually consist of no cover [unless it's the weekend] and then free PBR until it \"runs out,\" which is usually around 10:57 pm, give or take. So to take advantage of free alcohol you generally have to show up pretty early. It's a cash only bar, but they do have an ATM in the back next to the photo-booth. Camel Girls frequent this place so if you're a smoker, look for them.\n\nThey have karaoke on Sundays, I've never been there when it's super crowded so if you like karaoke it's a good spot to be.\n\nNo complaints, always fun!"}
{"input": "Amazing sushi! Lunch prices are great. Endless sushi and hibachi!"}
{"input": "PI...oh PI...I had such high expectations.\n\nWe arrived and sat, the staff was great. The table was too small, but that's just a minor little quibble.\n\nThe chicken wings were tasty, and the chips and dip are great.\n\nThe pizza was, for lack of a better word, average. I expected much more out of such a well known slice. Maybe I will go back and try again, and if I do I will let you know what I am thinking."}
{"input": "In short, save your money, people! The website hasn't been updated in I don't know how long. The name has even changed. I'm surprised I even found it. I think it's Smuggles or Snuggles, something like that. I ordered the BBQ wings and a Deluxe 14\" pizza, extra mozzarella cheese . ($27 and change) Wings were awful, overcooked and I've never tasted a BBQ sauce like they used. The girl that took my money didn't even give me back my change. Pizza is cut in aquares, like Imos and the bacon was laid on top . I mean strips of bacon, no cut up bacon. Pizza was ok, taste wise, which is the only positive thing I can say about this place. There was no extra mozzarella cheese on it. If you go to pick up your pizza and it's after 10pm, wear ear plugs before going in."}
{"input": "Cousin's is the place to go if you live in North Philly. I take this joint any day over Fresh Grocer. \n\nThe only complaints I have is with the produce (which is expected considering it is COUSIN'S after all) and the hours (like many others have said, they have awful and inconvenient hours post-5pm).\n\nThat being said, I can get most essentials here and for much cheaper than anywhere else. \n\nThis is only a two minute bike ride from my apartment so there's no reason not to shop here. Matter of fact, I'm headed there tomorrow.\n\nWhen it's too cold or you're feeling to cheap to go to Trader Joe's, Cousin's is the place to head to."}
{"input": "The food was great but the awful service took away from our first experience there.  We were so excited to try this place but the lack of any attentiveness from our waiter was so unfortunate. We are easy to please and had minimal requests. So upsetting!"}
{"input": "Great place! Right around the corner from where we live and we also go at least once a week... The cocktails are yummy...food is yummy... The bartenders are always friendly and attentive. Our favorite small plate is the cheese plate... perfect with a glass of beer or mixed drink. The atmosphere is perfect - cozy, dim lighting, and relaxed. They have 1 TV so if you want to watch a game its on...but its not in-your-face bright and they don't have the volume on...Thank you for that! \nLove this place, and we are so happy its in our hood! Cant wait to try their brunch!"}
{"input": "These guys are awesome. Most storage facilities are equal (once you check security and cleanliness off the list) -- it's the people who make the difference. George, Randy and Jason were all fantastic to deal with. Very customer service-oriented, professional and friendly. They also worked hard to get me the best rate. No upselling or shifty high pressure tactics. And they always say hello when I drop by to put thing in my unit. A very good experience!"}
{"input": "Huge hotel with shops and small restaurants ($$).  There's short indoor walking distance to the auditorium and ball room.  The hotel accommodated patrons visiting for graduations, proms, bridal parties, clubs, etc.  Many atriums for chilling out and walking.  The hotel has a community feel and at times felt like cruise ship when walking by the rooms.  Fully staffed and had a nice lobby.  My favorite was the island style restaurant with the lamps all around.  Many spots for photos."}
{"input": "Went in for full set, request long showed picture. Nails were cut short no big deal, the issue came when I pointed out a crooked nail and was told it hadn't been filed, acrylic was put on nail still crooked. It was filed and getting shorter and shorter. This wasn't my first visit however it will be my last."}
{"input": "It's like a semi fast food semi restaurant. I only had a cheeseburger and milkshake which was really good but I'm only giving them 3 stars because I keep comparing their cheeseburgers with New Orleans hamburger and Seafood co who makes the best cheeseburgers. It's still good but i would stop at the other place too :/"}
{"input": "Very nice, good service and the food was good. Steak came out overcooked but had a new one out very quickly.  Good place for special occasions. Expensive"}
{"input": "Delicious and authentic Thai/Laos BYOB that I would definitely try again.\n\nI don't usually wander too far into West Philadelphia but I'll have to make an exception for this place. With the cute interior and the papaya salad along with beef jerky was nothing short of amazing, I'll have to return sooner than later. Especially for the Thai tea as well. Some places make it watery but it was made just the way I liked it.\n\nStaff was friendly and attentive. Service was a little slow but it was a busy Saturday night, so it was understandable. A must try."}
{"input": "I'm becoming a big fan of this place. I love the fact that the staff and owner are very personable. The tap list ranges from excellent to outstanding. The menu has some nice different options like the pig wings, the bacon 3 ways sandwich, and always has specials on the chalk board."}
{"input": "I was a little hesitant at first based solely on the name, thinking I was getting Americanized Mexican food, but luckily I was wrong. \n\nThe business is family owned and operated and it's honestly the best taco place I've found. My coworker and I literally drive passed 3 other well known taco places just to come here for lunch.\n\nMy go to used to be the Xtreme Grilled Fish Tacos but the owner suggested trying them Tijuana style and I haven't gone back. You really taste the quality of the fish with the Tijuana tacos. That plus the cilantro, purple onion, and whatever sauce it is... Magic! \n\nEveryone I have brought here loves it and goes back. I would highly recommend them. \n\nOnly tip, call ahead. They get busy for lunch and calling ahead really cuts down your wait time. \n\nSorry there's no picture attached. My tacos were eaten before I could take the picture."}
{"input": "Wasn't an exceptional experience. Wife is a diabetic, so she attempted to avoid the ingredients that would cause issues.  So she went the \"steamed\" route.  The grill hadn't been cleaned between courses, and there was a palatable taste that just seemed incorrect.  All in all, we won't be going back."}
{"input": "Excellent food and quick, responsive service. We had a party of 12 and sat right next to the tank. The oyster appetizer was delicious and so were my shrimp and grits. When we are back in the area we will return again. Everyone in our party loved it."}
{"input": "Wasn't horrible.  First time visit. What made me visit was the photo of the shrimp and grits they posted on Facebook. (Sponsored post, I believe)  I see a lot of reviews that rave about the cheesy grits, so I had high expectations!  Unfortunately, I was let down.  The price was $12.99. Not outrageous, but I felt there could have been more grits on the plate. The plate was very shallow, but wide.  As for the taste of the grits, I was ready to have awesome, cheesy grits, but to me, they were lacking in cheesy flavor. The shrimp were flavorful and cooked well. The bacon in the dish was excellent, so it wasn't a complete bust, but I would not order it again. My wife had an omelet which she said was very tasty.  If we go back, I would like to try the fried green tomatoes.  That is IF we go back."}
{"input": "Had a great lunch recently and for what is supposed to be a college hangout, the food is fabulous. Fries to die for. My spinach wrap on my grilled cod was so fresh, I swear they just made it. Had a very fresh salad as a side and the homemade ranch dressing was thick and creamy. Sabrina our waitress was great too. Will go back and try something else."}
{"input": "This is for a to-go order. If you want to learn about the ambience of this place go read another review. We got a large pepperoni pizza late Saturday night. They deserve a solid star just for being open past 10. So many pizza places in the area close by 10 on the weekend! Sad! The pizza was on point. I loved the crust and they actually put sauce on this pizza. Feels like every other pizza I eat is all cheese and bread. Had I only ordered that would have garnered five stars for his place. \n\nWe also ordered 10 buffalo chicken wings and they were awful. The sauce was all at the bottom and the chicken was more soggy than crispy. I love chicken wings. Down south I'm a bit of a expert (always order all flats and get them wet). These were really bad. I would definitely come here again and just order the pizza."}
{"input": "Solid all the way around. Looking forward to sampling other items on the menu."}
{"input": "So so in love with this place & it is gorgeous. A very spacious & modern design & most of all CLEAN!!!! Love Will, Amanda & Sal! I have made several purchases to include some mods and atty's and being a newbie I have issues from time to time with the devices. Not because the devices aren't working but I may take something apart and can't figure out how to put it back together (newbie ish) lol They always help me and get me back to vaping!!! They have a wide variety of juices, mods, atty's and i'm always in there tasting something. You've got to try it! You will not be sorry! In love with this spot!"}
{"input": "Once again, the people hoarding Hilton chain had to do it!  From the desk, the gift shop, concierge (HE IS WELLLLL CONNECTED! So treat Lewis well!), great room, great service, great people!  Keep it up folks! And the location - awesome!"}
{"input": "OMG I am so excited! Every hibachi place in Tampa has like 2-3 stars and my hubby and I weren't excited to pay $100+ for a so-so meal. Then we found Kuchi...! We've been to this plaza a million times and have never seen this place, but it's brand spanking new!\n\nThe staff is so friendly...seriously..the hostess and waitress were all smiles, the chef was HILARIOUS and did all kinds of awesome hibachi chef things like shooting sake into our mouths, shooting zucchini into our mouths, the volcano, the peeing boy, the egg-roll.....lol (not every hibachi place does all these..and the shooting sake one is pretty rare)!\n\nThe sushi was delicious, the soup/salad were great, and we loved the steak/shrimp/chicken...even the owner came over to say hello and make a joke about how his hands are tired from massaging all the beef lol!!\n\nNothing negative to say...everything was wonderful and we will DEFINITELY be back!"}
{"input": "My mom and I love this place oh and my step dad comes here almost every day. I love their soft shell crab sandwich and I am just in love with their fried pickles. The sauce that comes with the fried pickles is just amazing it has just a hint of horseradish in it. just makes it so much better than the rest. The only thing I don't like is the place is so small and so packed and when it's raining and cold you have to wait under the awning or in your car but you can't hear when it's your turn to be seated"}
{"input": "This hotel was gross. There was a stinky cigarette smell on the second floor. The smoke detector was hanging from the ceiling, wires exposed. There was a layer of dust on the upper ledges of the tub. \n\nI was here pretty much to rest up for a cross-country trip. I slept 3 hours at most because of the smell--it permeated the bedsheets.\n\nI give 2 stars to the friendly ladies and fellow who checked me in and out. They were nice people."}
{"input": "This will change your life! I absolutely enjoyed my snoball and I am itching to return. Hooked! Stuffed cheesecake is the best!"}
{"input": "I have never had a bad experience at this sonic. The carhops are always friendly and our food always comes out how we order it. Last time, it took about 5 minutes for them to bring out 2 drinks. To make up for it, they gave us tokens for 2 free rt 44 drinks!"}
{"input": "Met a friend here tonight for a few drinks and food. I've never been here before and really liked it.  It has a nice rectangle bar and was lively and hopping on a Friday night.  Had a few glasses of wine and ordered the fish tacos and fries.  You get your choose of sides.  The fish tacos were spicy and absolutely delicious.  Three very hearty flakey fish tacos were served ( I'm thinking they were mahi) The women next to me had ordered the chicken  tenders dinner. It was huge.  So many enormous crispy breaded chicken pieces were served and she said they were absolutely delicious. She clearly had meals for the next several days.  I will definitely be back here."}
{"input": "If I could give this place six stars, I would! They honestly have some of the best vegan food in the city. The vegan chicken po-boy rocks my world. I don't think I've ever had a vegan meal here that I didn't absolutely love. They have a spectacular beer selection as well. I also enjoy that despite being in Old City, it does not attract the douche-baggery suburbanites. Very hip and low-key. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"input": "This place is exactly what you hope that a Greek themed restaurant would look and taste like. The server was prompt, friendly and kept drinks filled! The flaming cheese is to die for and I had a Greek salad and my family all had the gyro for lunch! The food was top notch and we got an assortment from the bakery to go. I would definitely be back!"}
{"input": "Tried the revamped menu. The duck is very good. Pub and Kitchen is always a solid choice."}
{"input": "Zio's is honestly one of my favorite pizza places in Philadelphia. For anyone from NY/NJ, it's one of the few places you could get classic pies like they make over the bridge. Sandwiches, pastas, salads and appetizers are all pretty good too. Staff has always been very friendly and treat us well when we eat in."}
{"input": "Food was good. I had the buffalo chicken soups, kids loved the grilled cheese and the bread it came on!  Service was not good!  Never offered refills although glasses were empty a long time.  I had to take our glasses over to the bar on the other side for a refill.  We Asked for ketchup several times, I went and asked another table to borrow theirs so the kids could eat their fries.  The lady who brought our food did not say a word just dropped the food on the table and turned around.  Took forever to get the check after asking twice.  The one waitress we saw on the way out said have a good night and she was the nicest person we ran into the entire evening.this is the second time we are been there and I will not be going back."}
{"input": "I'm not sure why I'm writing this since you can just look at every other review written for this place and get the exact same story. \n\nMy wife was literally grabbed, like actually literally grabbed, by the face the second she stepped in the door. The culprit was a big-tittied shot girl that proceeded to dump a bunch of piss water down her throat. Then I was informed I owed her $24. When I refused to pay I was told the police were being called. My wife, not wanting to spend our trip coming to pick me up at the police station, (which is where I gladly would have gone rather than give a penny to these shady-ass MFers), swiped my wallet from my pocket and paid the bill. \n\nEverybody there from the door guys to the managers to the bathroom attendants are the worst, most sketchy people on Bourbon Street. If you gave this place a five-star review please do humanity a favor and shoot yourself in the face."}
{"input": "A great little café! The salads and sandwiches are very good... I suggest trying the City Hall, a jalapeño pimento cheese and bacon Panini! Very friendly and helpful staff! Great place!"}
{"input": "This is the best location EVER. The donuts are made to order I believe after 5pm. They are always super hot you can barely eat them . Even the next day they are delicious."}
{"input": "Went here for the first time a few weeks ago on my birthday. The restaurant itself is in a fantastic location in the gulch. It was graduation weekend for Vanderbilt so it was a little crazy/busy for the staff, but the good was excellent. We had the steak and lamb for the entrees in addition to the grit soufflé and foie gras for appetizers. The grit soufflé was absolutely amazing (we were able to order without the bacon jelly - huge plus for non pork eaters out there). Both the lamb and the filet were excellent and extremely well prepared. They even bring out a bread basket beforehand which had a great selection. I can't comment on the wine as we brought a bottle with us- but other people looked happy with their drink selections. All in all would definitely go back, but it may be a good idea to not go during a super busy weekend like graduation (common sense on our part- just had to subtract a star because staff was preoccupied with larger family tables nearby)."}
{"input": "This place was okay.  The service was great--food was nothing to write home about.  The milkshakes were delicious though.  It's right on 130 so location is convenient.  One thing that rubbed me the wrong way is there is 1 small container of crayons for the whole restaurant.  Talk about cheap!  If you are going to cater to kids what is the big deal about getting a bunch of containers--they are not that expensive."}
{"input": "Great hangout for wine, cheese, and some music outside.  Tried some of the food - bacon-wrapped dates & brussel sprouts - all unmemorable.  Also tried the sardines which smelled and tasted past their prime - sent back."}
{"input": "Thanks goodness for Pacific Health Foods in Carp! Whether it's popping in for a smoothie - or getting all my grocery needs fufilled - from fresh products including organic chicken and eggs, chips, oils, vitamens and other health aids, this place is great. Plus, Nathan is always very helpful- - and if they don't have something i am looking for, they will usually order it!"}
{"input": "Lots and lots of mostly fried seafood. Surprisingly expensive for a working class joint. It's the kind of place a dock worker would take his family for a fancy meal and not feel out of place. And it's definitely a New Orleans sort of experience. But the food isn't that great."}
{"input": "I went there for drinks and found the environment really nice with the brewery right there. The beer was good and the waiter was very knowledgable and kind"}
{"input": "This restaurant is attached to the Drury Plaza hotel, so it was conveniently located for dinner when you're not really familiar with the area. There were 20+ in our party each night and the service was pretty good. Only a few forgotten drinks, which was to be expected with such a large group. \nPortions are huge and food was good. I had the Cuban sandwich one night and it was massive but delicious. The shandy is good. The margaritas are not and I don't recommend their patron one. I forget the name but it wasn't that good. Their shrimp tacos have a kick but they're good too."}
{"input": "Gardens of Babylon is appropriately located next to the downtown Farmers Market.  I'm no expert gardener, but the place is pretty large, and seems to have everything you could ask for: soil, fountains, cacti, ceramic pots, exotic plants, trees, rose bushes, a shade garden section, and, most importantly, some classy lawn ornaments.  The staff was helpful and everything was well-organized and labeled.  \n\nIn addition to the nursery, Gardens of Babylon also offers landscaping and design services.  They'll even give you free advice on your personal projects if you bring in a picture of your yard or garden."}
{"input": "Mild was far too spicy. The staff was nice, but the white waiter was pretty inattentive (and partially def I think). Food and prices ok."}
{"input": "I really wanted to like Milk and Honey, but we had a pretty average meal here. My streak was over cooked, and tough to chew. Other meals were nothing to write home about. They were also out of some of the whiskey's on the menu and dessert items.  In a city with so many great options, won't be back."}
{"input": "I just had the trio that was an appetizer that was amazing. Also I try there pizza it all really good."}
{"input": "Haven't had their sushi (yet), but hibachi chicken exceeded expectations on 5 fronts: speed, presentation, taste, price, and ability to customize (I asked to make mine light on the salt). The size was impressive too."}
{"input": "When you actually look forward to the day you have your Dental appointment, you know you have a great dentist!\n   Thanks for keeping my smile perfect Dayley Dental!"}
{"input": "Just as many others have stated, I too had a work related gathering here. This was my first time attending and the event had a set menu. Maybe next visit I'll see their actual menu. Being vegetarian when I saw my group had already chosen either fish or steak I knew I was gonna have to be THAT person and ask for an alternative. The host, of course, were more than happy to accommodate me. They mentioned their Sweet Potato Agnolotti so I accepted. It was amazing. I also enjoyed their house Cabernet a lot. The room that was reserved for us was on the second floor. It was nice to be able to mix and mingle on the balcony before our event began. The host were phenomenal as well. I can't wait to return."}
{"input": "Haven't had a chance to try much of what St. Louis has to offer in Mexican since I'm fairly new here. Tried this place and won't be going anywhere else for my Mexican fix. Authentic flavors and textures makes it even better, makes me think my brother-in-law's mother is in the kitchen. Great food, good prices, excellent portion size."}
{"input": "Every time I am in NOLA I stay at The Saint! I love the personal experience and their southern charm.  The staff truly goes out of their way to accommodate you. I stayed during the Essence Festival and encountered a few problems but they rectified it promptly. Customer service is their #1 priority! Thank you Saints!"}
{"input": "This was the best vegan food I've ever had! I ordered a $10 Crispy HipCity Ranch Chicken Sandwich, and it tasted like a classic chicken sandwich, but perhaps even better? The flavors were so good, and I quickly devoured the juicy sandwich. This location also had really friendly service.\n\nI've tried their $4 Banana Whip at a HipCityVeg food truck; it was pretty good and is essentially healthy banana ice cream!\n\nI'm very tempted to go back again tomorrow, and I'd go vegan for a day a week if it meant I could eat here! :)"}
{"input": "Coffee was ok, timbits were tasty breakfast sandwich was awesome. Staff was friendly, ran out of oatmeal but were accommodating to whatever Food item I wanted in the store."}
{"input": "Unbeatably good ice cream!  Love maple walnut, and they had it with blondie bits -- to die for.  This is THE ice cream place to go to if you are in Nashville -- forget the others!"}
{"input": "I was excited to learn that an Indian restaurant which delivers had opened in the area, and Nirvana Fusion did not disappoint. I was extremely pleased with the variety of options on the menu, the service, and the quality of food. Our order arrived promptly and everything was warm, fresh and absolutely delicious. The butter chicken and naan were particular favorites. We're looking forward to ordering again soon and trying some of the other dishes."}
{"input": "Wonderful experience! Kelly at the front counter was more than helpful. We do a lot of traveling for work and I must say she did an exceptional job helping us find food around the area and almost acting as a tour guide. Her service was more than appreciated and we will definitely recommend staying here. Clean rooms, great service and shuttle bus driver was extremely friendly and helpful as well!"}
{"input": "Good, casual, homemade bistro fare at a very reasonable price.  Everything was made from scratch - the bacon, the mustard, etc.  The atmosphere was nice.  Just a really solid place.  If I lived in New Orleans, I'd be a regular!"}
{"input": "This place is complete trash. I just recently bought a 2015 Toyota Corolla s and I got free oil change cards and a bunch of coupons. Charged me $60 for an oil change WITH A FREE OIL CHANGE COUPON, they told me it's high synthetic ow-20 oil so it's gonna be extra. They said it runs $12 a quart, I can buy a 5 quart oil (the exact same they used) at Walmart for $20..?!?! They thought i was an idiot and proceeded to tell me more bogus stuff I needed for my car like a filter (which I knew wasn't even my filter so they switched my air filter out and took mine!) and that I needed new wipers and I had just put new wipers on. They left my pristine clean engine a mess with fluids all over and dirtied my car and changed all the settings inside. So of course a free oil change turned out to be $60 with a recommended $200 for other things. The managers here at the desk WILL RIP YOU OFF. I watched as they did the same thing to everyone else. DO NOT GO HERE!!!! I WARN YOU!!!!"}
{"input": "I would give it 5 stars but I when I look at my rating dispersion I realize I might be a little generous.  While all I had here was Oysters they were spectacular.\n\nAsk for Kentrelle at the Oyster Bar and have him make you the \"firecracker.\"  It will blow you doors off."}
{"input": "This review should actually be three and a half stars. Cafeteria-type vibe, very no frills, with healthy offerings. I got a glass of fresh squeezed juice and the stuffed avocado salad and paid about $15 including tax and a small tip. I'm sure there are more innovative options (menu and flavor wise) for comparable prices nearby. That being said, the food is basic, good, and yes, affordable. The descriptions on yelp were accurate - I had some food left over for another meal."}
{"input": "This is the best Vietnamese food in Reno. The owners used to own and run S&K noodles up in Sparks and it was the best before they sold that location. The noodle dish with pork, egg rolls and shrimp is always a must!  Everything else I have tried has always been great."}
{"input": "Great variety of coffees and teas. My current favorite is the iced dirty chai. The staff is very nice and acknowledges your existence without making a person feel rushed. Table sizes for everyone! They also feature local artists art to purchase. I enjoy the vibe."}
{"input": "I needed a quick eyebrow waxing and was skeptical of where to go. My eyebrows are thin already and I didn't want someone to ruin them. I walked into European Wax Center and got my eyebrows perfectly shaped, in under 5 minutes, for $10. It was honestly faster than getting in and out of line at Starbucks! I will definitely come here in the future."}
{"input": "I had to switch between a couple of hotels when I was in town as rooms were booked solid everywhere. As far as the room goes, this hotel was number 1. I was very impressed. Modern/new feel to it. Excellent service. I worked out at the small gym, which was good enough to get the job done. Location is in the middle of downtown, walking distance to everything."}
{"input": "Muriels has delicious food and fantastic service! The goat cheese and crawfish crepes are AMAZING and the seafood stew so flavorful and satisfying! Even though we were stuffed we had to have dessert. Go to Muriel's and indulge. You will be happy you did!"}
{"input": "This is the place to go if you want to experience the Santa Barbara mountain trails and excellent views via ATV! Our guide; Jorge, was very respectful, fun, and ensured our safety was of the utmost importance. We didn't have much experience with ATV's so the confidence of having him around was an excellent feeling.\n\nAs for the ride, Jorge leads the pack and even takes pictures during the ride. When there is a reason to proceed with caution, he indicates it to have us slow down accordingly. I could go on but for the sake of space and readers sanity, I'll finish this with simply stating that if you want to rent ATV's this is the place to do it. You'll encounter extremely helpful people who have your best interest in mind. Great company I hope they're around for a long time to come!"}
{"input": "Great selection of yogurts and toppings.  Great place to bring children they have lots of tables to sit and enjoy your dessert."}
{"input": "It's date night!! We would usually head down town, but had to drop little man off at the sister in law's. \nSalad was not a salad. Lettuce and the ginger dressing :(. However they have a full bar. The atmosphere is nice. Tonight is a quiet night due to weather, so if you want to eat at the grill make a reservation. The food at the grill is excellent and you will have left overs. \nSushi is great!! Never disappointing. Ordered the soft shell crab for the first time as an app. It's ok. More breading then meat. Edamame is better!!\n\nThis is not the place got my low carb diet, but delicious!"}
{"input": "Great Thai food!! I had the Spicy Thai Basil with Chicken!!! Yummy!! Great cool weather with great company at a relaxing Thai restaurant in a lovely patio setting!! Will be back for sure!!"}
{"input": "Yesterday was the 2nd time I have ate there, both times late in the day. Yesterday I was on a ride and saw it, stopped in for food and to warm up. Chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes. Real potatoes. Gravy was ok, steak was just fine. Salad before was ok, tough to make a bad salad. Slice of pineapple upside down cake. All was a great meal. 3 sugar coffee, most places are 2 sugar for me. Waitress was wonderful(wonder if she's single? Lol). Prices were very good.  Nice place in the middle of almost no where(I live in largo) and you can tell they have quite a few regulars."}
{"input": "If you're looking for atmosphere, go somewhere else. If you're looking for giant saucy chicken wings (for a good price) and great NY Style pie, this is the place. I was pretty surprised. I got a slice and 10 wings for $11 which I think is cheap. Try the teriyaki."}
{"input": "Not the best pizza in New Orleans, but good enough. The cans of tomato paste at every table made me skeptical about how the final product would turn out, but I was pleased with the outcome"}
{"input": "Came to see my son's band Last Frontier. The staff and food here is top notch!   Had the porkbelly and fish nachos.  Awesome.  Great selection of whisky. Great sound system for the band."}
{"input": "My husband and I ate here today. It was so good. It wasn't our original plan to stop there but the business across the street was out of oysters. ( oyster house?)\nSo, we decided to go to Landry's. Wonderful and friendly staff. The food was amazing. The oysters we had were spot on what we wanted. It was our last stop before heading out of town. I forgot our waitresses name but she was great. Very friendly. \nWe also got the bananas fosters cake. For $13 it's a huge piece. And so good! \nThanks Landry's we will be back."}
{"input": "I ordered delivery online through Yelp, and the food took about 45 minutes to get to my door.\nThe delivery driver was friendly.\nI ordered a bbq chicken pizza and it was really good. They spread the good stuff out over top of most of the crust which was awesome. I also ordered mozzarella sticks, and they were not really what I was expecting--they weren't breaded, they were deep fried. They were good, just not what I was expecting. They also gave me two free cookies with my order and I have to say they were SO good. They were a little undercooked so they were perfectly chewy and they were almost the best part of my meal (and a nice little surprise). The price was fair and I would order here again for sure, although the wait was a little long."}
{"input": "Finally found a place to hang out with fellow Washington redskins fans!! Friendly bar tenders, plenty of tvs to catch multiple games on cold beer an great food too. The really nice thing is u can order a large pitcher of beer but they break it down into two smaller ones for u, then give u a token to redeem the second one later so it's not just sitting on ur table getting hot while u finish the first one! Love it!!\n\nGo redskins!!!!!!!!"}
{"input": "Great place for big groups. Friendly service, I asked for what they recommended and they were 100 % on point. You can pretty much customize anything you order. Bathroom smells amazing, lol..."}
{"input": "This is an absolute MUST visit.\n\nEverything about this place is damn near phenomenal.\n\nThe food is fresh and clean; you can tell it hasn't been frozen or sitting in a fridge.\n\nThe service is great! All of the employee's there are friendly and helpful (I can barely pronounce \"perform\" correctly).\n\nThey have a lot of Gluten-free and Vegetarian options, which is nice."}
{"input": "Best place to grab a bite to eat in Smyrna!!! Food is always wonderful and the owner is just awesome!!! Recommend that everyone gives it a shot !! The burger with egg and bacon on top is amazing!!!!!!!!"}
{"input": "OMG....passing through the mall, the girl offered me a sample.  It was moist, sweet with a hint of coffee.  That little teaser was enough for me to try it!\n I bought the original and the almond.  Needless to say the original didn't have a chance to come home with me. I ate it on my 7 mile drive home. I can't wait till the morning to have my other bun for breakfast with my coffee....I can NOT wait :)  it wasn't greasy. It was fluffy, airy and delish."}
{"input": "$8 Pad Thai for lunch - quite tasty. Great to have a Thai restaurant in the Melrose neighborhood. Service was a bit slow, but everyone is super nice."}
{"input": "We ate here as a walk in birthday celebration dinner on a busy Saturday night. The host was very accommodating and found us a table quickly.  The service was great and the food was fabulous.  This is a great local place with a wonderfully cozy atmosphere. We live in a town with few really good food options so this is a great option if u are looking to stay close but have a great meal. The location on the river is beautiful too. Would be great if there was a real outdoor seating option."}
{"input": "I have been to the 5 Star in Clayton several times and absolutely love it. Went to the one in Kirkwood yesterday for happy hour. Thoroughly Underwhelmed. The sliders were below grade. I got a veggie burger, a regular beef slider and a chicken burger and fries. They were underwhelming. None of them were the quality of the Clayton location. The bartender was busy, we had to ask for water twice and we were sitting right in front of her. Again I know she was busy but that's the name of the restaurant game. If you are looking for happy hour in Kirkwood this place would not be my first choice.  Still love ya Clayton 5 Star."}
{"input": "Fish Tacos were OK. But when you charge $4.95 to replace fries with fruit, that's just absurd.  And it would be helpful if the waiter noted the extra fee when we ordered."}

{"input": "On the banks of the river ... is the best pizza I have ever eaten, period.  Its as much about the crust as it is about the balanced accompaniments.  A thin but delicate crust with rewarding texture and flavor that offer meaningful contributions to the topping interplay (rather than delivering toppings in an after-thought, unremarkable, edible vessel).\n\nThe perfect meal so far ...\n- VASI - Ceci Beans and Lentis (tomato scapece, grana padano)\n- ANTIPASTI - Aggrodolce Pork Ribs (green apple, pistachio)\n- LE PIZZE - Spicy Ham (coppa piccante, san marzano tomato)\n- DOLCI - Zeppole (blackberry yogurt, lemon curd)\n\nHonorable mentions and amazing seconds if you can manage ...\n- VASI - Cannelini Bean Aioli (smoked pepper, arugula, sicilian tuna)\n- ANTIPASTI - Carciofi Fritti (fried artichokes, lemon yogurt)\n- LE PIZZE - Quattro Formaggi (ricotta, scamorza, marinated tomato)\n- DOLCI - Cannoli (pistachio, lemon-ricotta, chocolate-olive oil)."}
{"input": "I went there for lunch yesterday. It was really good! The staff was very friendly and the portions are almost enough for two people to eat. The recipes are from Mrs. Doll and one of her son's is carrying on the legacy."}
{"input": "This is an incredible spot in the funk zone of Santa Barbara. Their burgers are overpriced ($18/$14) which is why they lost a star, otherwise great beer selection and the lobster Mac and cheese was delicious. Highly recommend stopping by. Beer cooler had a great selection as well."}
{"input": "Armed with a LivingSocial deal, we came by for dinner before heading to the Avenue of the Arts just 1 block away.  Don't judge the quality of the sushi by it's slightly sketchy looking website or less-than-sleek store sign - the sushi is great.\n\nWe got a variety of standard rolls, which had generous portions of fresh fish.  The Reverse Maki (rice on the outside) tend to have more fish than the Hoso Maki (seaweed on the outside), so opt for the former. The Salmon/Avocado was particularly good, although the Yellowtail/Avocado and the Spicy Tuna were also solid choices.  \n\nI'll be back to try one of the sushi entrees!"}
{"input": "I'm not a praline expert but these were solid.  Very friendly staff that will give you nice sized samples.  Tried the chocolate caramel tortue, which was one of the best turtles that I've had -   very fresh, chewy and chocolatey."}
{"input": "Everything great about a jewish deli, southern comfort joint and a bit of mexican dive restaurant all mixed together. Brisket is good, but don't expect a tomato based sauce. Latke is not a normal round one, but super delicious. I also took the Jewish Apple Cake to go and despite being a little too brown on the bottom, it was delicious even 3 hours later on my flight back to LA."}
{"input": "Being my husband and I travel to Central America (and hopefully one day to Cuba) we love authentic Latin cuisine. \n\nOur first visit we ordered the Cuban sandwich, black bean soup, platains, and cafe cubano. Each was delicious. We've gone back multiple times and have had consistent, delicious meals. The cost is an added bonus as you get decent portions. \n\nThe interior is colorful, fun, and reminded us of a small cuban style restaurant we've been to in Guatemala.\n\nKudos to you on keeping everything authentic. Broad Ripple -- please take note of this jem as we need more like it!"}

{"input": "A great place to listen to live music and have an afternoon cocktail or three. The hodgepodge seating in the backyard gave it a fun, quirky feel and the drinks were delicious and affordable  (but happy hour helped, too). The cheese plate was also quite yums in the tums. Bacchanal is a fun, memorable, tasty way to spend a day."}

{"input": "It was okay.  We had gyros.  I have had better.  I doubt we will be going back.  But, it was clean and the staff was very friendly."}
{"input": "Meh. I had heard good things about this place, but I feel that it's overrated. The patio area was cute, but the chairs were pretty uncomfortable. Plus they sat us right in ripe smelling distance from the porta-potties (I think they're remodeling their bathroom or something). I had the huevos valenzuela-- meh again. It did the trick but was a bit bland. I don't know. Service was pretty good. Maybe this place would have warranted 4 stars if it weren't for the wafting breezes of urine stench."}
{"input": "Butch did a great job. The tour was relaxing, informative but 2 good stops to eat and see the cemetery. I recommend going on this trip the beginning of your stay so you know where to go during your trip. He'a also pretty fun."}
{"input": "The food is delicious. The bacon wrapped dates are the bomb! However, you will spend some money here. The portions are a bit small for the price. My wife and I ordered 5 tapas between us and could have ordered more. You won't be disappointed though. It was all very good."}
{"input": "Great finds and wonderful staff! \nLOVE our finds and will definitely be back!!!"}
{"input": "Came here on a Monday at lunch time. I sat at the bar and received fast service. Ordered their carne asada taco lunch special which were better than average. More than pleased with this place"}
{"input": "Went here since I saw it was on Food Network. It didn't disappoint. You get these chips that are hot and the dipping sauce was delicious. I got the grilled honey mustard chicken sandwich. It was huge and good. Their fries are seasoned and were good to. Hubs got the Philly cheesesteak which was good too. The staff was friendly. They also have happy hour on Sunday so that was a nice bonus. Glad we ate here!"}
{"input": "DO NOT plan your out of state move without using the relocation services provided by Preferred Rental!! My fiancé and I worked with Wendy and would 100% recommend her to any busy professional, looking for a stress-free moving process. I am still so impressed with how easy she made it to find a place. Wendy helped us find a beautiful rental with everything on our \"must-have\" list for under our budget! Not only that, but she was able to find us a house in 2 short weeks. This is amazing, considering I spent 4 weeks browsing through homes/ apartments and contacting realtors on my own with no success. She knows the area like you wouldn't believe and made sure we ended up in a neighborhood that was perfect for us. Do yourself a favor and work with Wendy, you will not regret it!!"}
{"input": "Steve is reliable and good at his job. Not sure what else you could want from a home services commonly? He shows up when he says he will, prepared and personable. When something looks dicey, he will tell you rather than going ahead and doing it anyway. For example, I had a canvas painting I wanted him to hang at my home. When he realized the frame was bent, he showed me immediately and told me once it was hung it would look worse. He is a gentleman and I was never uncomfortable alone in the house with him. Can't recommend Steve and Sierra Home Services enough!"}
{"input": "We decided to try this place out, considering that other nearby restaurants nearby such as Lucky Bamboo and Miss Saigon are really good. Plus it was rated high on Yelp. The pho was mediocre at best, and the meatballs and seafood were imitation mystery meats. Not to mention, the service was not much better either. The waitresses seemed like she was trying to rush us out. Plan on bringing cash since they do not accept credit cards. This was my first time visiting, and it's definitely my last. If you want better tasting food with better service visit VN Pho or Miss Saigon."}
{"input": "Welcome to laundry heaven.  First of all, it's huge! Here's the rest: it's clean! And you will see staff cleaning while you're there.  You will also see 5 + huge flat screens on the wall, along with vending machines filled with laundry necessities and snacks/drinks.  The machines: various sizes of commercial grade washers & dryers.  Washers range from $3-$6.50 and dryers are $.25 or $.50 for 7-8 minutes (depends on size).  \nThere are always staff around and they're nice and helpful.  I think they also offer washing/folding services - ask the front desk.  \nParking is not usually an issue unless it's peak after work hours.  Walk to Starbucks while you wait - or sit at one of their tables or chairs and enjoy their free wifi.  Forget the quarters- this place uses laundry cards you can refill on your Visa/MasterCard.\nThis place puts my old laundromat to shame, and it's closer to home, cleaner, nicer and all around better (no more quarters!!!!!!)\nLast wash at 9:30pm."}
{"input": "Absolutely fabulous stay at the Loews hotel Philadelphia! The service was fantastic! Room was clean, had a great view. It was my boyfriend and i's anniversary and the hotel gave us champagne and chocolate covered strawberries at no extra charge!  My boyfriend spoke with concierge Kimmy and she made everything so special! They even put rose petals on our bed while we were out at dinner! Would definitely recommend to a friend and we will definitely be coming back to stay again!"}
{"input": "I will definitely be coming back!!!  Staff is super friendly, place was immaculate and my pedicure was worth every penny!"}
{"input": "I stopped in for dinner and a drink & was thoroughly pleased! I rarely order a burger when I go out to eat, because why order \"out\" what you can make easily a home, right? Well..... when I go back I'll have a hard time NOT getting another burger. Oh, they also have a decent beer selection and the wait staff/bartenders made me feel very welcomed too.  My food was prepared exactly as I ordered and was served quickly.  The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and the restrooms were clean.  All in all I was very happy!\n."}
{"input": "If you consider the reasonable prices, the beautiful location and the need for such an establishment in this area I have to say this was a five star experience. The service was smart and easy going with our two year old son. She comped us an app when our drink order took an unusually long time and she ran down her list of favorites for us twice. We ordered 8 things on the menu and not one was average or just satisfactory, everything was delicious. My favorites were the octopus app and the asparagus app. So good.... cherries and truffles yum yum yummy."}
{"input": "Food is good, but the cafe itself is extremely dirty. I will probably not return unless they clean the place up."}
{"input": "I need Rehab, I need rehab! I order 2 original banana puddings on Uber eats every Weekend. It is consistently delicious! The best I've had thus far!"}
{"input": "Tony's really has surprisingly good Mexican food, which you wouldn't expect to find out here in Chalmette.  It's actually the best Mexican food I've had in Louisiana.  Everything I've tried there is good.  My favorite so far is the chiles rellenos, which are large and excellent.  They also have Mexican Coca-Cola, which is sweetened with actual sugar, rather than the high-fructose corn syrup in the American version."}
{"input": "Before buying any furniture for our new home in Tucson, we shopped around. We actually shopped around too much, visiting 20+ furniture stores in the area.\n\nHands DOWN discount mattress barn was the cheapest. \n\nSteve personally set up my bar stools on one visit, and made 100% sure it was assembled level. And on another loaded my extra large ottoman into my van all by himself.\n\nBy purchasing from Discount Mattress Barn, you get so much more than just the best value. You get amazing customer service!!"}
{"input": "Yah. Eat here. Do it. Now. The homemade bagels with the avocado mash were well worth it, as were the juices juices juices juices. This Northern boy wasn't ready for the grits...tasted like they were made with a cup of heavy cream. Delicious, but I would steer away from a large portion and stick with the small cup unless you have a deathwish.  Arrive near opening time to avoid the lines."}
{"input": "This place has a very unique feel. We nearly missed it on our walk to dinner; there's no real label on the corner restaurant.  \n\nThey have an eccentric mix of IPA's and Pale Ales. The menu is very interesting as well; their buffalo wings and the cavetelli appetizer were both amazing..the cavetelli was served al dente with amazing flavor. I had the skate for my dinner, which was probably the most delicious fish I've had in as long as I can remember. \n\nThey are known for their burgers, which were very good as well. They are often compared to Village Whiskey's burger, and sadly I don't think they are quite on par, but still very good.\n\nThis place is on the pricier side, but the ambiance on a Saturday night is a mixed crowd; noisy and full of energy. Nicely done!"}
{"input": "Okay, not a great second experience. The first time I went was during happy hour and all I had were the tacos(lengua, Carne asada) there, amazing stuff. The visit today was not the same. I thought I would try a different dish: Chile Relleno. I ended up opting in to getting it stuffed with Carne Asada which I thought would enhance it greatly. . .not exactly. To start, and maybe end, the \"Chile Relleno\" was covered in what seemed to be a marinara sauce, not good at all. Not a Chile Relleno. The tacos I got were good though."}
{"input": "I was impressed.  The chips and salsa were good.  My burrito \"wet\" was great as was the refried beans and rice.  Best rice I think I've ever had at a mexican restaurant.  Jesus was awesome.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"input": "I lived in chicago for a while...and whenever I crave chicago style pizza...and have 2-3 hours to kill this is where I go.  The other reviewer is right-- the sauce can be hit or miss...but when it hits...you are in heaven.  The crust is almost like a pastry......\nI enjoy it."}
{"input": "I am an amateur athlete. I first met Dr. Ferrel when I was playing softball. He was watching my game when I was severely injured.  He treated me on the field by relocating my ankle and then told me to come to his office for treatment. I told him I could not afford that as a single mom on a teacher's salary. Instead, I saw a physician. He said it would be months before I would play again. Depressed and without much hope, I reached out to Dr. Ferrel again. He did treat me as he promised. Not only did he treat me, he healed me within weeks instead of months. Over the years Dr. Ferrel has worked on me with amazing results each time. He will always be my hero..."}
{"input": "This place is amazing ! Will make you feel special and relaxed! It's very clean and the staff is very friendly polite and professional! Michele did my meni pedi and was very very good!  Great spot to come in with a friend. Will definitely go back!"}
{"input": "I absolutely love Jimmy Johns. I will never come back to this one.  They screwed up my ordered and their first response was \"Sorry, we can't take the sandwich back after its served. That's a health code violation.\"   Too many places that care about my business for that crap."}
{"input": "I have been going to the Pantry for years and I have it down to a science. For one thing here are the ground rules. It is a hang over cure for the Vanderbilt and Belmont University set so weekends after 9am will be a bear to get in. The line can stretch for hours and blocks BUT once you get in the service is fast and efficient. \n\nThe cool factor is that I have gone in on a weekday found myself a scant table or two from Vince Gill or Kevin Costner quietly enjoying breakfast without much fanfare. \n\nNow the pancakes are obviously the thing to go with on the menu. I usually get a half order because I have a small appetite. My favorites are the sugar and spice because the syrup is something out for this world. I also like the chocolate chip because they drizzle the chips on top. So you mix the half melted chocolate chips with the half melted butter and then you poor a little bit of syrup on the pancakes and it's nothing short of a religious experience. \n\nThe coffee is just OK."}
{"input": "3 stars means I like it and I'll be back for more. I love Cuban food.\n\nI lived in Tampa a long time and got to eat a lot of Cuban food. I'm excited to have another Cuban place here in Indy. There aren't many. \n\nWhen I think of good Cuban food, I think of Cuban bread, yucca, plantains, pork and cafe con leche...just to name a few.\n\nToday, we got the Cuban sandwich and the plantains. They were both really good. The portion size of the sandwich was huge. It could easily be shared. The pork and ham were good.\n\nThere were two big misses. The biggest miss is the bread. It's just not right. It was almost the consistency of a cracker. It wasn't bad, but ALL of the Cuban bread I've ever eaten was much better. Even if it's pressed, I've never had cracker-like Cuban bread.\n\nCuban bread is something that I would order as a side, I love it so much. This bread missed the mark.\n\nMaybe I missed it, but there was no yucca on the menu. I really love good Cuban yucca. That was the other miss."}
{"input": "First time here and I have to say it's pretty good! The bake shop fits well with the fishtown environment and it's very clean and welcoming inside. The display of beautiful cakes let's you know you have top quality bakers there. \n\nI got a few items to share such as a Burbon Pecan cookie, chocolate chip cookie, vanilla cupcake with buttercream icing, and a vanilla cupcake with raspberry icing. \n\nI had a taste of the Burbon Pecan Cookie. It was not too sweet and you get nice bites of pecan; a nice hot coffee is a perfect compliment.The cupcakes were good (cake wise) but, not a huge fan of the icings. The cake itself was sweet and moist. \n\nDidn't get to try the Chocolate chip cookie but the concensus was that it's delicious. \n\nI would definitely come back and I have taken a big interest in having Cake Life make a custom order!"}
{"input": "Ordered fresh made pie, not reheated slices.  Some of the best pizza I've had in philly, because of the tasteful and crunchy crust and good amount of toppings.  Had a Cowboy steak with no BBQ sauce and couldn't stop myself at two slices.  Got the same pizza again with bbq sauce and it was just as good so now I do half and half."}
{"input": "It is a shame, since my kids love the jungle gym, that this place is such a dive.\n\nIt is dirty. Really dirty. And a lot of attractions are in pretty lousy shape.\n\nThe air conditioning is barely holding on. It is a super hot day, but c'mon, I shouldn't be sweating buckets just sitting and my kids are so hot we're headed out after being here a half hour :/\n\nIt is pretty cheap, but not worth it when the conditions are so rough that we can't stay and play. We were the only ones here on a weekday afternoon, I guess everyone else has already figured out what a dump it is.\n\nEdited to add: I let the kids get a few tokens from the token machine on the way out. The machine spit out tokens that the games wouldn't take and management wouldn't give us new ones saying that those aren't jungle wonder tokens. (Even though I got them from the machine in jungle wonder.) \n\nNever again."}
{"input": "Steakhouse. You cannot fault a restaurant for being focused, but they should be expert at what they focus upon--steak. The filet was ordered medium rare and arrived scored and hot light pink all the way through. The salad and side were equally sub-par. Decent wine selection though they were out of my first choice.\n\nThe food here is passable, though uninspired; but, it's a steakhouse, not a chef driven establishment. No, the real failing here was the service. The table was not cleared and cleaned promptly, the food wasn't served politely or properly. A young man literally dropped my plate in front of me from across the table without saying a word. A modicum of decorum is an absolute requirement for this kind of place, and it was here that Fleming's fell flat.\n\nIf you eat your dinner with the television on and order your steaks well-done you will think this place is just fantastic, I'm sure."}
{"input": "I love this bar so much! The staff is super friendly with a dash of attitude but the shit talking can flow both ways. All the bartenders were super friendly and approachable as well a fast and willing to make drinks out of their norm. Doorman is friendly which is unusual but a welcome change in the sea of douchebag bouncers in Reno. Hookah girl is a rockstar and even offered to help me with my photography after we chatted about it. Great place and super mellow!"}
{"input": "Cool joint! Super friendly staff that is more than happy to let you sample everything before you buy. It's like a free flight!"}
{"input": "Oh Khyber Pass Pub, i love you so, so much. One of the very rare places where myself, who is  vegetarian, and my fiancee, who is decidedly NOT  vegetarian, can share a meal and both of us leave happy. Definitely try the vegan pulled pork sandwich, as well as the nachos, and the hush puppies for sure, and if you're doing brunch there, which you should, you have to get the bananas foster french toast, it is ridiculous."}
{"input": "Awesome margaritas and food is good but the rudest servers ever! One literally tried to use non-verbal gestures for me to move (May I add he was coming from behind me) and then stared me down walking away. Gabby our server was nice, polite and made it better. I'm wondering though in the interview process if they only go for dirty hipsters?"}
{"input": "We have and do like this place, the pool is dirty. We use this koa as a few day stop over in our travels. Hit the town etc. First time this beautiful was used by us as the weather has allowed it. And really can't buy a pool cleaner for at night to clean leaves, sand and dirt out. Cement deck is covered by dead leaves. Koa man walks around looking at women like a rooster. Lol internet is weak and a battle to use. Strange as they have really did up the place and it's that or this way. Must be weak management. Paid almost 70. For a back in"}
{"input": "I come to Dagwoods all the time with friends and family. The food and service is great! This family owned restaurant really makes you feel at home. \n\nWe started with some drinks and seafood apps. The clams in white were awesome! Perfect flavor and consistency. The broth was so good, I wanted to treat it as if it were soup. We also got some crabs to share, they were a good size and were warm and cleaned. \n\nI chose to get one of the specials, the Salmon, and WOW was I impressed. It was cooked so perfectly. A slight crunch on the outside (not burnt) and juicy on the inside. It was honestly the best salmon I ever had. There was a corn succotash on top and it came with orzo, because I can't have gluten I chose to sub broccoli. \n\nI am impressed with Dagwoods every time I come. They never fail to amaze and create a great experience weather it's your first time or you're a regular."}
{"input": "I love Italian food and with this being so close to home, I gave it a shot. Not only did they exceed my expectations in food quality and quantity, but every time we order pick up, or dine in the girls treat us amazing (You rock Alexa!) Thank you for being awesome."}
{"input": "This is an above average pizza place. They don't try to be too fancy like other local joints. Just straight forward delicious pizza. There are slices at a decent price. Their pies are more expensive than the chains, but they are also much tastier. To save a little, there are daily carry-out specials. I haven't tried the subs or other offerings yet, but I look forward to it. Not much of a dining area. But if you're looking for a good pizza to eat at home on the east side, give this place a chance."}
{"input": "Favorite place in Nashville for breakfast!! This is a must go to spot!! Near Vandy and always busy...park in the back lot and be sure to get the parking ticket from the machine so you won't be charged...its free parking for a specified amount of time. My favorite is banana pancakes...think banana bread only in a pancake!! Perfection!!!! I don't leave Nashville until I go here to eat my pancakes!"}
{"input": "We have been here 3 times and enjoyed great, friendly service on each occasion. The buffet area is clean. The waiters are very helpful and quick to collect the dishes from the table and bring water/drinks. One of the times we came the bathroom was pretty dirty, that's the only minus. I really liked the pulled pork in BBQ sauce with chips, although I think they only have it during lunch on weekdays. Also... banana pudding! Ha ha, it'd been a while! They also have ice creams in many flavors. One time we came the waitress kept practicing her Spanish with my mom, who speaks very little English. Pretty cool!"}
{"input": "Great rock climbing gym. Lots of bouldering ranging from easy to really intense. The staff are friendly and I really like the fact that they can belay for you. It is on the small side so when it's busy, it feels a little crowded."}
{"input": "Unhelpful, unapologetic, and not worth the hassle. I will take my business elsewhere in the future."}
{"input": "what can I say? I truly believe my life just changed!! Cynthia is amazing! She is so kind and understanding. This was my first visit with her after having 2 bad experiences with acupuncture and she has made me a believer!  I have issues from menopause to polycystic kidneys and liver to chronic pain and I look forward to having Cynthia and acupuncture help me regain my life!"}
{"input": "Great service, great food, and great drinks. Found this gem on yelp and glad to say the reviews were right. Good quality Caribbean food in the \"south.\" Will be back, without a doubt :-)"}
{"input": "I was satisfied in every aspect of this hotel.  It is located close enough to the waterfront attractions to where you could technically walk.  But it is not a very pleasant walk.  That said, the hotel offers a free round trip shuttle to that area which was punctual and pleasant.  Our room was spotlessly clean, the front desk service was quick and courteous, and the breakfast was pretty good for a hotel breakfast buffet.  If I am ever in Wilmington again, I would certainly stay here."}
{"input": "Always crowded but how can you blame them? Last time I went in here I met 2 famous people at the bar and had the best sushi of my life! oh yea and waited 2 hours...."}
{"input": "I love this place. I've had several of the pasta dishes (all excellent), a potato soup du jour, and the side salad. I'm addicted to their perfectly spiced Tutto Mare.  As an added bonus, they serve Pepsi products! \n\nEveryone I've taken here has enjoyed their food immensely. My dad couldn't get enough of their side salad! Service can get a bit spotty as there is only ever one woman serving and it often gets quite busy. That said, she's good at what she does and has friendliness to spare when the place isn't so crazy busy. The space is nothing extravagant, but I'm used to it from eating here when it was Global Noodle years ago so I'm not the best judge.\n\nIf I had had an Italian grandmother (or one who cooked at all), I'd expect that this little place would feel a lot like home."}
{"input": "We had a fast leak on I-55 a few weeks back 3 hours from home on a 15 hour drive.  Due to one odd lug on the affected tire, and lack of the right wrench, my wife, my kids and I were stranded.  Called several times to Allstate Roadside Assistance and got the robot runaround.  I was losing my cool fast, when up pulls Pomps tire service as if God heard our prayers.  Gary from Pomps had the tire fixed and back on faster than I could put my spare tire away (no kidding).  The fix was good as new, tire hasn't been a problem since.  I would recommend calling these guys if you need to get back on the road fast with a permanent fix, not just help putting on the donut."}
{"input": "horrible food! waited for my nachos that took forever!!!! when they came they were freezing cold even the chips highly disappointed wish i could've given them  no stars they do not deserve any of my stars"}
{"input": "Such a nice- looking place, but they need to get their act together as far as service.  A little too slow.  The server was great!  Once we received our food, we all enjoyed our selections."}
{"input": "SImply not impressed.  \n\nI got a burger with blue cheese and carmelized onions. \n\nThe meat was high quality, but the bread to meat to cheese ratio is all wrong.  The burger was very thick and as such left most of the bun meatless.  They could have made the burger thinner, gave it greater circumference, and not left me with a half grilled cheese/half burger scenario. \n\nNot a big fan, won't go back/order delivery.  Its simply not a good burger and at $60 for 2 people, I'd rather try the devil I don't know."}
{"input": "Fresh grouper is amazing here. Prepared anyway you want it.  Family tried 5 different meals and they were all great. Came on a Sunday night and the wait time was awful, took at least an hour to get a table. But it was the day before Memorial Day.  Would definitely come back again though."}
{"input": "The spicy beef pho is wonderful. The broth is really good, the best I've had in a while. Service is great too!"}
{"input": "Came in here on a Friday night not really expecting much but to watch the Sixers game. They had a few drink specials, none of which really appealed to me. The mixed drink I got seemed really weak. However, at around 9pm the bartender ABSOLUTELY BLASTED the music to the point where my mate and I paid our check and promptly had to leave. We could still hear the music playing all the way down the street. I don't know if they do that to lure people in or scare them away. I prefer other bars in the neighborhood..."}
{"input": "Blue Sage has been my go to place during the Lenten season for the past few years! As someone who eats meat, I had doubts about trying it initially since it's a 100% vegetarian but I was pleasantly surprised and now I'm hooked! \n\nI love the feel of this place -- it's very charming. It's pretty small so I recommend that you make a reservation especially if you plan to go on a Friday or Saturday evening. Please also note that it's BYOB and the dessert menu changes occasionally. \n\nThe adobo goat cheese nachos are a must try! I also recommend the black bean soup, the mediterranean sampler, the blue corn asparagus tacos, and the falafel wrap. \n\nThe only dish which I'm not fond of is the wild mushroom risotto."}
{"input": "The only reason I did not give Copper Top one star, is because of the quality of the wings. This place is definitely a hole-in-the-wall. The inside is dark, dingy, and looks like nothing has been updated ever. \n\nThere is a bar area, some tables, and then a section with pool tables and darts. This seems like a place that consists mostly of older regulars, and some college students looking for wings and reasonably priced drinks.\n\nThe few times I have been there the service was not great. If the staff knows you, they are attentive. We were served after the bartenders were done talking to other people. They were not exactly unfriendly, but they were not the most hospitable. The one good aspect of the bar is their wings. This is my boyfriend's favorite spot for wings, especially spicy wings. I would suggest ordering wings to go."}
{"input": "Stood in line and were ignored. The host proceeded to seat his friends who were clearly standing behind us before asking if we had been helped."}
{"input": "A couple months ago we made the mistake of getting there on a weekend around 10am or so and there was over an hour wait. I was too hungry to wait that long and told the bf we HAD to go back but earlier.\n\nTried again and success!!  Got there right when they opened and there was already people starting to file in.  Managed to get seated and served very quickly.  We both ordered the pancakes.  I had the butter pecan and O.M.G...  His bananas foster pancakes were good too but those butter pecan ones are the best (in my opinion).   The pancakes also come with 2 eggs and a meat.  Big fan of them offering turkey sausage and turkey bacon.   \n\nGo.  It's awesome.  Just get there early and wear loose pants."}
{"input": "Was excited for some good food until I actually tried it. Nothing was fresh. Had gumbo and fried shrimp. You can tell it was old. No real flavor. The mac and cheese to my surprise wasn't good either. Old and flavorless. Would not recommend at all."}
{"input": "TWO THINGS: best SHRIMP N GRITS I've ever had (I live in TX) and best PECAN PIE I've ever had (literally melts in your mouth). \n\n\nThat is all!!!!"}
{"input": "The only reason why I am giving this company ONE star is because I cannot give it ZERO stars.  Terrible company.  Incompetent, unreliable and unprofessional.  Constant turnover of staff.  They sometimes didn't show up for their weekly appointments (with no explanation) BUT DID CHARGE ME.  Always had to be chasing up behind them, making sure they were doing what was supposed to be done.  They haven't put the required salt in my pool for over two weeks. I AM DONE WITH THEM.   If you want your pool damaged, then I definitely suggest you hire these clowns.  If not, STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE.   The owner is about as arrogant and smug as they come and will NEVER take responsibility for their screw-ups.  They also constantly tried to bill me for invoices which were already paid for.   BAD BAD BAD"}
{"input": "I must say, I was hesitant to eat here after seeing some of the yelp reviews...I was however pleasantly surprised by both the quality of the food and the attentiveness of the staff.  We sat at the bar (as we typically do) and had just a great experience.  \n\nMy only less than positive comment is regarding the 'sports bar' label...no don't think they can yet call it that.  They really need more tv's before that label would stick.  I'm not going there football day.  \n\nThis place is great for kids and adults alike.  \nI look forward to exploring the menu more in the future!"}
{"input": "Went here for the first time yesterday. Staff was pleasant and food was really good. My husband especially liked the Vietnamese coffee! Too strong for me, but he loved it."}
{"input": "Not sure if it's right that sushi was warm when it came to the table. Service was sloooooooow."}
{"input": "Ate breakfast here 11/13/2013. The line mid-morning on a weekday was a bummer, but testament to the popularity of the place - and for good reason. Forget everything else on the menu, just be sure to order the sweet potato pancakes with the cinnamon cream. It's the best experience you'll ever have with your clothes on. Service was prompt (once seated) if a little brusque. Dining area is clean and attractive. Food came out hot and well presented. The eggs were fine, the sausage nothing brilliant. My partner had some southwest style cornmeal pancakes and loved them. But forget all that. The place is a 3 star rating at best but the pancakes make it a special meal."}
{"input": "Rude staff. Can't even get a salad order right. Overpriced by the slice. When we sat down to wait for our food I thought wow this is taking a long time given the fact we were the only people in there. I guess it should stay that way. Don't waste your money."}
{"input": "The donuts are nice but nothing out of extraordinary . I just ordered two simple donuts , one chicken sandwich ( they are really tiny ) and black ice coffee ( plain) and paid 15$ . Cold brew costs $3,25!!!  ... that is more expensive then Starbucks charges for plain black coffee ... again coffee is ok . They charging $1.75 for ONE plain donut and $2.75 for \"fancy\" donuts .... way too overpriced for a donut joint ! And the atmosphere and cleaning of the shop is not aligned with the prices they charge !"}
{"input": "Love this place & especially the tech Pearl! Her work is perfection and she goes above & beyond to make you happy."}
{"input": "Get a hand grenade and it will keep you company as you walk from here to Jackson Square to sit down on a bench. Then head back to Bourbon down the block and get a refill on the hand grenade (if you still have your cup) which is cheaper than buying a new drink like a sucker off of the street.\n\nIt is sugary and tastes like trashcan punch if you were ever in a frat, or invited to a frat party. It's not as alcoholic as I expected. I could still remember my name and all of my problems after chugging one."}
{"input": "Great pizza and fast service.  Highly recommend the mushroom, sliced tomato and jalapeno combo.  Always hot and ready when I stop in to pick it up.  Reasonable prices too especially when you order two pies.!"}
{"input": "Absolute garbage company. Trying to get from Indy to Chicago and they are more than an hour late, did not inform me of the delay, and their entire customer policy (feel free to read it on the website) consists of \"we cannot be held responsible for anything.\" Sitting at a bus stop with 20 people whom are all having their time wasted with absolutely no recourse."}
{"input": "Generally a great Starbucks. There are large amounts of seating inside including both tables and comfier options including leather chairs and sofas. The outside seating is nice, but the ambiance is disrupted by large amount of traffic on Hazel Dell and 116th.\n\nThe staff is generally really friendly and the service is quick. This place is crazy on the weekends, with 10+ cars waiting for the drive through, so I would definitely park and stand in the line inside (it's generally a shorter wait).\n\nAs Starbucks go, this is a good one."}
{"input": "Amazing lunch. Burger is the best in Boise. Fabulous prime rib sandwich and dessert. Everything food wise made in house. Great wine selection and have a $35 and under wine menu. That is appreciated. Excellent service. Will definitely visit again. Recommend highly!"}
{"input": "But, It might be a 2 stars.  All of the staff were great, but the 2 room suite with a small version of a kitchen was more like a 2.  Poorly done \"remodel\" or just plain in need of remodeling.  Bummer"}
{"input": "I'm so incredibly happy with our pictures! Angela Clifton Photography have worked with us 3 times and we have been happy with every single picture that was taken! Not only are the photos fabulous, but we had such a fun experience. The price is extremely reasonable and the pictures will be a keepsake we will cherish forever!"}
{"input": "Poor at best. Had the odd mixtos taco plate. A few pieces of meat set in and inch deep of bubbling cheese in a small square super hot skillet. I picked out the meat which was there (small portion). Disappointed at the price also.\n 20 bucks for bad tacos!!.\n\n I did not say it out loud but the word came to mind as I pushed the plate away....garbage. not trying to be rude, but being honest.\n\nIf you are looking for authentic mexican food, you will most likely want to skip by this one.\n\nVery disney-esque it it's mexican appearance. All style, NO substance."}
{"input": "I was here before once. Didn't have much of an impression. I went back again this week with my friends. We were very disappointed. We ordered this grilled whole fish. It came out in a big pot with vegetables looking like left overs. The fish was about the size of one hand, but it only had half of the fish served!!  The dish was $30. We four each took one bite and it was gone! I went home hungry! I ordered a take out for my husband. The serving size was about half of the same dish I ordered from the other Chinese restaurant . I felted being robbed."}
{"input": "Everything was Amazing!! Ordered the Chelada and my husband ordered the Jalapeno Margarita which were both so flavorful. We shared the Appetizer platter that looked even better than online. This was an amazing assortment of Chicharrons, olives, cheese, Smoked Salmon, Pickled cauliflower, pickles, tortillas with agave....more more and more. So delicious!! We also ordered the Carne Asada which was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Our sides were the Brussel Sprouts and Street Corn. Everything was absolutely delicious and our Server was very friendly and helpful :) 10 out of 10 for me"}
{"input": "I was in Santa Barbara last weekend visiting my friends who live there and I came across Backyard Bowls on Yelp. This place did not disappoint. You can it is a happening spot, hence all of the reviews and consistent business. \n\nI give this place 5 stars because the service was quick and friendly. Also, it is definitely one of the best Pitaya (dragonfruit) Bowls I have ever had. They give generous portions and the taste is just impeccable! It includes strawberries, blueberries, bananas, a little sprinkled coconut, and granola! My friend ordered the Berry Bowl and she loved it as well. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes a healthy & delicious boost to start your day! \n\nNext time I am in SB, I am definitely coming back. Thank you, Backyard Bowls!"}
{"input": "My go-to for pizza in the montgomeryville/chalfont area! Always delicious, never disappoints."}
{"input": "We went on a Friday night and the place was full, but even so there was only a 20 minute wait. \nThe service was ... Hit and miss. I don't want to rip on our server too much because our server was obviously trying but just not hitting the mark. The food was Ok, but I don't believe I'll be back. It just wasn't great."}
{"input": "Second time's the charm. Stopped by once to have a duplicate key made only to find that their hours were not at my convenience. My bad I guess. Stopped by a second time a week or so later - (it's close to home, so why now swing by?) - this time they were open and they proved to be very helpful.\n\nPleasant encounter with the gentleman behind the counter who quickly cut several odd-shaped keys for me that the big box stores could not duplicate.\n\nQuick, polite, efficient, and cost-effective."}
{"input": "Despina is the waxing godsend of EWC! she is quick and friendly! You leave there feeling so fresh, their wax is FAR better than the strip junk. Despina is very professional and listens. \nshe has made my eyebrows on fleeeek. Who would ever think you would enjoy waxing appointments???! I do thanks to Despina!! The best in the biz."}
{"input": "I finally made it to Mac's on a Wednesday night for Quizzo.  I'm a huge Always Sunny fan so this place was pretty much guaranteed two stars.  Some of my friends are regulars so they know the bartenders.  The servers were really helpful in setting up our oversized quizzo team table.  I only stayed though the first round, but the questions were decent.  Only problem is that its really hard to hear the questions in the back.  I definitely think this needs a spot in the UYE Cross-City Shuffle."}
{"input": "Very tasty, filling meals.  Over-sized desserts (which is good).  Very attentive staff.  Lousy coffee, though."}
{"input": "Love this place! Quick, delicious and service is great. Pho, bahn mis and spring rolls are all perfect! Never miss an opportunity to eat here."}
{"input": "Good, convenient, but not great.\n\nBeen a few times- always left wanting more/better/different. I like the crispy crust, but am not a big fan of the residue it leaves on your hands. Tried it again after purchasing a groupon-- got the pizza breadsticks which were good, but the accompanying sauce wasn't hot. The margarita pizza was good, and the fresh mozzarella pizza was delicious, but it wasn't hot/melted enough. My boyfriend had the BBQ pizza and thought it was \"pretty good.\"\n\nOnce again, left wanting more/different/better. Maybe if things were hotter, we'd be more likely to go.... especially since I practically live next door. Close, but, as they say, no cigar."}
{"input": "I love this little place!  I go there atleast once a week now.  I have tried the other bowl and juice places in the immediate area.. but they truly don't compare to this place.  I can't help but be a repeat offender of their Rainbow bowl.  OMG it is out of this world fresh and delicious.  Their granola adds the perfect crunch, who doesn't love coconut and honey and there are so many gorgeous colors in this bowl.  If you are looking for some \"Acai-cream\" as a healthier alternative to the yogurt and ice cream pretending to be healthy.. You must come here and try them.  \n\nThey also have cold pressed juices and lots of other delicious things.  This is just my favorite bowl!"}
{"input": "I went to André Richards yesterday for the first time because I had. groupon for a wash, cut, trim, dry and highlights and because I've been looking for a good place in Philly.  The salon had a good set up with plenty of space, especially for a Philly salon. It's kind of hidden on Locust Street, but spacious. \n\nI was about 5 minutes late due to parking further away, but the salon got me in and within a few minutes, LB was going over what I wanted. She was super cool and we had some good conversation while the foils were going in. After they were all put in and set, the foils came out, toner went in for some more waiting. LB was good about checking up on things and offering coffee, water and tea. After everything was done setting, I got a good cut that was exactly what I asked for. I was pleased itch the outcome and it really didn't feel like it took 3 hrs like it has at other places I've been too! I wish I had found this place sooner"}
{"input": "Ordered a medium well burger. Came out medium rare. Ate the edges. Waitress apologized but didn't offer a thing."}
{"input": "Most beautiful place to get married, we chose the Mural room and it was great except some people came in were rude. We knew it was open to the public but I expected a little more courtesy from them. Just as I was about to walk down the aisle people were trying to go in and we asked them to wait but they snap that they were allowed to be here. True but let the bride walk lol other tourists sat down and were very excited for us! Linda was a pleasure to email with when reserving the room. The lady at the information desk accused us of stealing a pen, it was returned I found out but she was too busy on the phone during the time and didn't notice it appearing back on her paperwork lol minor things that didn't ruin my perfect day but to be aware of. Wouldn't change the location. And bring a pen to sign marriage license  and remember no a/c or heat"}
{"input": "Cool ass brewery/bar. Very unique decor that suits the name of the place. We came on dat afternoon and it was packed but we got 3 seats easy. Beer selection was good especially for imperial stout lovers. No food there but you can bring your on or there are plenty of places across the street."}
{"input": "Well, I just want to say we came here by chance and we are very lucky that we did!\n\nThe warm atmosphere, very excellent Server, delicious food and Happy Hour was a bonus. \n\nDon't miss this neighborhood eatery/Bar"}
{"input": "This place was great! It's a nice old building and the bricks give the rooms a nice feel. It's also close to the French Quarter. The A/C worked great and the room was comfortable. The problems I've had were fairly minor. The floors squeak really bad. You can't breathe without the floors creaking. The elevator is also a little scary. Other then a few things that need to be cleaned up or fixed its a great place."}
{"input": "My husband and I were wandering around Doylestown and looking for a place for a late lunch / snack. We found Hickory Kitchen and will definitely be back! \n\nHe ordered a pulled pork sandwich with two sides - sweet potato casserole and beans. The sandwich was good, not exceptional but certainly nothing to complain about. The sweet potato casserole was about as expected, but the beans were as good as we've had in the area. \n\nI ordered wings and potato salad. The potato salad was good, but the wings were AMAZING!! These are my new favorite wings in the area. I ordered them with the house barbecue sauce, and while I'd like to try other things here, I don't know that I'll ever order anything else. When I want wings, these are exactly what I want."}
{"input": "Recently spoke to Dani the manager after some back and forth discussion and some stern replies we managed to work out a few kinks in the delivery process! didn't want to knock the place for bad delivery service its something that is hard in this area due to all of the new buildings going up. So after a few mins over the phone he smoothed everything over! communication is key my friends~ now back the the pizza!! its as good as it gets in university city!"}
{"input": "This is the kind of restaurant that can put Indianapolis on the map.  Exciting new flavor combinations, great vibe, excellent coffee.  The wait may be long but it gives you a chance to try out some of the pastries and fantastic coffees or drinks while you wait.  I love sitting at the bar and watching them cool the food, it helped me to decide to get the amazingly delicious grilled cheese.  Don't miss out on the bacon either!  Order it as a side and you can thank me later.  My wife got the sweet ditch baby and I got the savory and we shared.  I couldn't decide which was better.  Brave the crowd and just go already!"}
{"input": "Had the chicken and French toast and it was over the top!\nWhile it would do some good to have more shade on the patio it was still an enjoyable experience. They are pet friendly too!\nWe will be back!"}
{"input": "I called into the office saying Im going to be 20 min. late to my appointment because I was in traffic. The receptionist made me feel irresponsible telling me the hygienist won t have time to do my cleaning! She told me the hygienist won t do my whole cleaning because she has LUNCH at 12 for an hour! It was my first apt so I had made apt for exam, X-ray and cleaning. I wanted to reschedule than but she told me I can t because I bought a Groupon and I can t be rescheduled. Just that experience put a bad taste in my mouth I still drove and cam in 10 min late I filled the paperwork and went inside to the room downstairs. The tv wasn t on the music was only playing, she took x-rays and than started scraping my teeth which now they hurt. They didn t hurt before! Than the doctor came in told me the filing cost about $150-255 because I don t have insurance. I will to go here again just because of the rude receptionist, and I didn t feel comfortable there."}
{"input": "I love coming here to do my smog on my cars great service and chipper then most!!! I totally recommend this place."}
{"input": "This place has been around for a long time, established back in 1865. Used to be the route, by stagecoach, to Santa Barbara from the Santa Ynez valley. I have been wanting to go for years and since we were in the valley celebrating her birthday, thought we would try brunch. We arrived at around 11:30, were handed lunch menus. Found out it was either breakfast till 11:00, lunch then a dinner menu. Lunch was good, had the burger, but was craving eggs.\nOur lunch was very good, our server seemed to have wanted to be else where, she seemed a little pissed off. The tavern was amazing, just thinking of the history of that place, the kinds of people that came into the canyon from there hard stage coach travels. \nEnjoy the drive."}
{"input": "This place is great. Good food, great service, and a fun atmosphere. Rooms are comfortable and spotless. Pool is great for an evening drink at the pool side bar. Tap room and front porch area is always well staffed and great for food or just to have a drink and watch the world go by. Easy access to all parts of Saint Pete and surrounding areas. Great place to stay."}
{"input": "Excellent food, atmosphere and service. Good prices. Great lunch menu!\n\nBurgers, chicken and salads are all terrific! And those fries....yummmm...."}
{"input": "I live in the neighborhood and absolutely love this place! Everything I have ever gotten here has been really good. They have a lot of dishes with very unique and distinct flavors. Overall, this is one of my favorite restaurants around. They also have a very good lunch special if you are ever nearby on a weekday."}
{"input": "The king suite is great.  The laundry was clean and well-kept.  The pool was small but was able to get a few laps in.  The gym was a winner it was packed every evening...   The hot cinder they had in the lobby was a real treat and a great addition.  The restaurant was great with a quaint bar.  Would deafly go back and stay there again"}
{"input": "The service was excellent, extremely friendly.  The food was average, the hummus didn't taste fresh as of that day.  The gyro plate was also average.  For this immediate area, this is about as good as it gets.    Prices are reasonable."}
{"input": "this bank sucks! actually i am not a fan of bank of america at all. i am switching. i have been depositing my work checks for weeks and months and sometimes they like to hold it and they can't tell you why they are holding it. pretty weird to me. they probably want to collect interest on it. its ridiculous. find a bank that will not put hold on your checks that you have been depositing for months. scammers. here is one of my conversations with one of the retarded tellers. \"yeah we are going to have to put a hold on your check\". why? \"the system will not allow us to know and we will hold it for a week\". wtf!? forget you man. i am going to a local credit union or something..bank of america especially this branch puts a pain in my ass."}
{"input": "Oh hell yeah!!  Came in for a simple burger and fries.  \n\nGreat food! Even better service!  \n\nWill definitely be a stop on any trip to Nashville.\n\nMake sure you try the Tuscany fries!"}
{"input": "Oh man! This is the spot right here! Everything is made to order and sooo worth the wait. I'm from Chicago and have been a self proclaimed sandwich expert for most of my life...this place deserves every bit of those 5 stars! Well done guys!"}
{"input": "We've been using Ranger for ten years and they have excellent and responsive service. No one is better."}
{"input": "We were craving Vietnamese food after 2 days of southern food. We had a group of 17 peeps here from Cali. Heard great thing about this place from our friends. Came in at 11am and was seated right away. We ordered the egg rolls, spring rolls, and crab puffs as appertizers. Let me tell you if was awesome. We then order Pho Chicken and Pho Filet. Let me tell you the broth was right on point and the noodle and meat was awesome. The owner Mr Tran came out and talk to us to see how everything was. Excellent Staff Service also. We shall be back next time we come back into town."}
{"input": "I love this place!!  I am not a fan to Mexican food, but their Fajitas is just exceptional.  I love their San Lucas fajitas plate.  Ingredients are so fresh and most of all, their tortillas are sooo good!  The portion is big so I sometimes would just like to share my plate!  Service is good too, and with the quality of food and service, even though it is a little pricey compared to other Mexican restaurants, I think it is all worthy."}
{"input": "Our group of 6 each ordered something different and everything we tried was great.  I highly recommend the banana pancake with peanut butter... It filled the plate and was enough food to feed 3 people.  Each of the fresh squeezed juices is incredibly good as well.  This is a must stop breakfast spot when you're in New Orleans."}
{"input": "Flawless. You will never find a restaurant like this. \n\nThe food, which changes seasonally, is always perfect. It is an experience by itself. I ordered a ribeye and it was the best cut of meat I've ever had in my life. Cooked perfectly. Seasoned and oddly breaded, which sounds unappealing until you taste it. Not only was it one of the best steaks I've ever had, it was one of the best meals I've ever had. \n\nThe fact that Chef Baldino spends his time walking around, shaking hands with people before they leave and having real, genuine conversations, adds to the already glowing ambiance. And the staff is well-versed and warm.\n\nIf you're willing to splurge on a dinner, make sure you go here. It is an EXPERIENCE!"}
{"input": "Food very good, great service and a perfect view.\nI recommend the crab cake and bruschetta!\nBut the coffee is terrible. $5 and it is just water that are colored black.\nVery disappointed because I love coffee and have tasted a lot better for less money."}
{"input": "Recently moved near this McDonalds location. Went one night and they messed up my order. Knowing that mistakes happen and wanting to give them another chance, my kids and I went back a few nights later. It wasn't until I got home that I realized that they completely forgot to put the cheeseburger in my daughters happy meal. They did replace the full happy meal and gave us free dessert but I won't waste my time going there ever again."}
{"input": "Buffet for lunch is AMAZING!!!!! Best service with amazing food choices on their buffet. for 10 bucks a person this place super rocks!"}
{"input": "I'm already looking forward to going back this Friday for a green smoothie!! I walked in and was immediately energized by the lime green everywhere. We ordered the Doc sandwich with hummus, tomato, cucumber, avocado and sprouts on twelve grain bread. I didn't remember seeing sprouts on the menu, but no big deal...I just picked them off. It was awesome! So light and fresh and perfect for lunch on a hot day. I also got the green smoothie which I loved. I can't wait for my next visit."}
{"input": "Steve & his partner are the best! Love that he'll do a bunch of demo racquets! Great prices with lots to choose from. If you're a player this is the place to go!"}
{"input": "Good choice of appetizers and entrees. You can choose the level of heat for spicy dishes. Nice quiet venue."}
{"input": "We were VERY disappointed with West Side Gravy.  My fried chicken was two small legs and a thigh, all undercooked,  served in a paper cone, with very small sides of tasteless potato salad and so-so coleslaw.  My iced tea tasted sour.  My wife had the lobster roll which was quite small and tasted mediocre at best.  My son had a hamburger and fries which was fine.  The service was adequate, but nothing special.  Not worth the $50+ (plus tip).  We will not return . The big reason for our disappointment is the fact that The Blackbird Restaurant (attached) is run by the same chef, share the same kitchen and the Blackbird is terrific."}
{"input": "Beautiful and great tasting cakes.  I travel across the city to get my birthday cakes from ESM.  Great service as well.  Very friendly."}
{"input": "Three night stay. Not plush but not a total dump. East side was noisy from a factory air vent and cable was short on channels but right near airport and Pima air museum with several breakfast spots (Waffle House and Denny's) close."}
{"input": "Muriel's is a great stop in NOLA. The goat cheese and shrimp crepes are by far the best food I ate in the city (perhaps anywhere ever) and the rest of the meal lived up to the appetizer. Service is great, venue is quintessential French Quarter. It's a little distracting to see ghost tours outside the window at dinner- but the food is so delicious, you won't mind the audience. Rumor has it that Muriel's is haunted, but the only thing other worldly I encountered was the cuisine."}
{"input": "Smoothie attack!  I rarely have smoothies, so it was odd that I was craving one.  \n\nTheir recipe is pretty simple yet so delicious and smooth: yogurt, a little fruit juice, frozen fruit and a little honey to sweeten the deal...or some variation of that.  The hubby had the strawberry banana and I went with a peachy banana smoothie.  Both were delicious, but I liked the peachy banana more, it hit the spot divine!  \n\nGreat cafe space with free-wifi!"}
{"input": "Authentic Greek taverna in the heart of Philly Fairmount neighborhood.  This family owned restaurant features a fantastic selection of tasty Greek food. Whether for a salad, a Gyro or and entree you can't go wrong with this classic local favorite."}
{"input": "Best pizza in Saint Louis. Whenever my family wants pizza, we always go to Dewey's. Great service, delicious salads, beer selections and plenty of seating. I recommend the Bronx Bomber and the Southwest BBQ Chicken."}
{"input": "The front desk lady at our hotel (The Lafayette) recommended Lucy's - and wow am I glad I asked! I got the shrimp and grits, my boyfriend got the jerk chicken. Absolutely fantastic! The place was surfer chic, had a great vibe and a cool bar as well. TV's viewable from any seat in the place, waitresses were attentive and had great recommendations on what to eat. I definitely recommend a stop at Lucy's. You won't regret it!"}
{"input": "Horrible experience, pizza was soggy and cold when I received it, took 2 hours until I actually received my order as well. Absolutely no communication on my order, even after calling twice. Once I finally received the pizza I called to get my money back, which was communicated that I would not be charged, soon to find out that I was charged the very next day. I highly recommend never ordering from here, service was horrible and they were extremely rude. I won't be ordering from here again and either should you."}
{"input": "I cannot say enough wonderful things about this place.  There is no bad seat in this stadium.  It has a wonderful view of the skyline.  I just love the liberty bell in neon sign that swings back and forth for a homerun.  Plus, the ticket prices are pretty reasonable and easy to get- before they won the World Series.  Food here is pretty decent just expensive.  There is dollar dog night but the hot dogs are pretty small.  I also like the fact they have freebies to give like those hand towels that fans wave in the air."}
{"input": "Great experience!  I went in for a routine cleaning and found the facility to be very clean and modern on the inside.  The hygienist was extremely friendly and helpful, and the doctor who performed the exam was also very informative and friendly.  I was there about 20 minutes early and was taken in right away, with the entire process only taking about 15 minutes.   It was great experience, and I'll come back again!"}
{"input": "In the area and found this location on Yelp. The young cashier asked if it was our first visit and offered samples before we ordered. He even gave us a free gift because it was our first time visiting. The food was fantastic! Full of flavor and huge portions. I tried pulled pork, baked beans, and corn pudding. Among the best baked beans I've ever had. My husband thought the pulled chicken had a bit of a bitter taste and his Mac and cheese looked a little bland. He offered to let me try it, but I would have had to share my beans and, despite the love I have for the man, I didn't want to. I deducted one star on behalf of his bitter chicken. Definitely recommend the restaurant, though."}
{"input": "My brother raves about this place and it was better than described. The service and food was excellent. Everyone was very nice and attentive. Cannot say enough good things about the place."}
{"input": "Price of Jim Beam $18 best I found in French quarter great service great family business. $6 smokes and they deliver!!! Gonna hit them up every time I'm down here."}
{"input": "Always outstanding. This evening, they were a bit short on wait staff but Frank our waiter made up for it, after some initial delays, with extraordinary attention. An outstanding generous gin Martini followed by the smoothest imaginable vichyssoise and a distinctive duck dish, all crowned by an exemplary creme brûlée. Fabulous! Whoever edits the menu should correct the spelling of sauce bearnaise and of Riesling."}
{"input": "I absolutely love coming here. Great outdoor place with a wine selection you can't find anywhere else (not your typical wines you find in the grocery). The live music today was fabulous - and on a Thursday afternoon! Come here, get a few cheeses and wine and you will be satisfied. Oh, and the regular menu is crafty and artistic. It's a beautiful place with ambiance and on the palate."}
{"input": "Great concept, decent healthy food, but portions are off. I ordered the Buffalo chicken sandwich minus the bun and had the veggies. While they gave me a generous helping of veggies, the piece of chicken \"might\" have been 3 oz. What a rip off! I can get more meat at other places and have it be the same price. Most likely won't be back unless it's to try a smoothie or get a vegetarian dish."}
{"input": "Man. This place is nice. The bartender was awesome. Try the burger. It's fresh with all local ingredients. The plates of food I saw come out looked amazing as well. \n\nThe beer is cold. The drinks are mixed perfectly.  This is not a chain restaurant but a dedicated local place with good employees."}
{"input": "I really enjoy the service here. I've been coming here for almost my entire life and the food never ceases to amaze me!"}
{"input": "I once had an allergic reaction to stealthy hidden carrots when I told the waiter that I didn't want carrots in my food.\n\nOther than that, it was yummy, but I think that the food really doesn't match the atmosphere and decoration of the place."}
{"input": "First of all, this place smells AMAZING. There are so many spices, spice mixes, and great loose leaf teas - it's hard to decide what to get. I was low on cash so ended up getting just 1/4 lb of Japanese Pan Fired Sencha tea, which was around $3 or $4. Great price for a good amount of good-quality tea! Am definitely coming back."}
{"input": "This publix is always clean and the staff always pleasant. Cashiers talk to you instead of being drones. Shelves always are well stocked and if out on a sale item are always happy to write a rain check. Always in and out quick. Never had to wait more than a few minutes in line. Staff always asks to help you out if you have a full buggy."}
{"input": "Pretty cool place and nice to be able to rent movies without waiting for the mail or getting in the car. And thanks to Video Library I finally get to see Pink Flamingos... so take THAT Blockbuster Online, prude. \n\n\nKind of low-tech operation, I walked in a little before or right after they opened yesterday and couldn't open an account yet because the computer was still churning something or other. Guy at the counter was friendly and pretty into the place. \n\nSunday, Monday and Tuesday are 3 for 2 rental days. :D"}
{"input": "It always has a strong smell when you open the door plus they aren't friendly or approachable at all..\n.I will never go in there again"}
{"input": "Went there for my birthday this summer because I'm a huge Sunny fan.  I ordered Hummus so that I didn't get drunk too fast.  It was so good, I got some to go at 2am.  If you don't get the Hummus at Mac's then I just feel bad for you.  It's so good it's almost criminal.  Trust me, I'm chubby.  I know food  :P"}
{"input": "The WORST electricity company on this continent. \nPECO simply did not have my address in their system, so I was not able to pay or get my account information. I gave all the information I could to them. I even read the meter numbers to the customer service morons, but they still do not know what was going on. Now they are threatening me that they would turn off my service because I did not pay. \n\nI think PECO's business motto is this: Solve all their problems with the I-WILL-SHUT-YOUR-SERVICE threat."}
{"input": "I found this deli on my map as I was driving towards 95... Even though one review stated that the hoagies here are amazing, I didn't rule out throwing away more of my hard earned money. \nWell, this is one very good deli. The hoagie I ordered was really good, and the service was friendly. The sign says that they've been here since 1948, and you can tell.... I love stepping into stores that have been in business for years and has that old school look, service, and products.... The hoagie was as good as it was propped up by other reviewers here on Yelp, and I'll be back for another when I'm in this part of town...."}
{"input": "I am giving this restuarant one star because we did not dine there. We attempted to though. We showed up on a Saturday night about 8:30 pm. The parking lot was full but we did not see a line or anything to look like there was a wait. When we walked inside the music downstairs was so loud it sounded like a Salsa club. There was no host to greet us. Finally a man came up to us and told us they were booked for the night and that there was \"going to be a long wait\". Uh okay... He did mention we were welcomed to sit at the end of the bar if we wanted to. Who wants to eat a nice dinner at the end of a bar? \n\nWe will not be back to try to eat here."}
{"input": "Had a great date nite with the wife, fried avacdo tacos, Chuck wagon nachos, and baby greens salad and shared all three.  Another great place to eat in D town.\n Food is always prepared fresh, this is not a fast food restaurant.. .as one review seemed to expect, and ignore the one star reviews by people that only give 1 or 5 stars, they are destroying yelp..we know the scam."}
{"input": "Worst hotel I've ever stayed at. Breakfast was terrible, and they had NO sugar in the entire hotel for coffee. We got stuck multiple times in the pool room because of the door not properly working. My sons feet were black from walking barefoot in our room. The water in the bath tub was constantly draining while my son was trying to take a bath. And we only came across one staff member who was polite to us. We checked out and went to a different hotel that was much better."}
{"input": "I love this little cafe. Currently my favorite dish is the garam masala bowl, but the veggie burger is pretty awesome. I love that they're dedicated to organic, local, and sustainably raised food, and the renovated former laundromat is pretty cool too.\n\nI've also been here for the Indian food they do on Friday and Saturday evenings. It's called Thalia, and they do an all-you-can-eat style. It's really awesome, and I highly recommend it."}
{"input": "Welcome to Flavor Town!  This was my first time to try Indian food. I had the Chicken Curry and it was amazing. Staff was friendly and service was fast."}
{"input": "Fabulous meal! Tender beef, crunchy broccoli, zesty General Taos Chicken. Yummy pork dumplings served with a sprinkling of chopped green onions. A cool respite from the heat outside. Efficient and polite wait staff. Clean with ample seating. An undiscovered treasure near the 40th Street Field and University of Penn campus!"}
{"input": "Ordered a large pizza-1/2 pepperoni and 1/2 cheese. The crust is not too thin and not oily at all. I subtracted 1 Star because I found it a little too salty. Otherwise- not bad."}
{"input": "Planet fitness gets four stars just because it is open 24 hours. If you are looking at cheapest it's cheapest best bang for your buck . Not much motivation since bodybuilders don't go there much mostly big women . No pun intended . No discrimination I myself used to be big, although I changed that . \nTanning bed and massage chairs and a sculpt machine and everything. Else for 20.00 a month . 9.99 - the massage and stuff and can't bring friends . All the employees are polite and helpful ."}

{"input": "The unlimited lunch buffet is 8.95 can't complain being on state street is a premium cost. However the chicken tiki masala is worth it, and they provide Naan, and rice pudding is _________.=( I  Love the decor and randomness of this House. Makes me feel like I could be in the streets of India, and to add, the random indian pop music videos playing on the TV's, my kids sit there laughing, entertained."}
{"input": "Went here twice during my visits to philly in the last 6 months and both time I enjoyed the food here. Cool lil place and that burger"}
{"input": "Favorite indian place in Tucson, hands down! Most always get meat samosas, tiki marsala, veggie korma, rice and naan. Never disappoints! The only complaint is one time on a to go order they forgot their delicious sauces for the samosas, but only happened once. Otherwise, get ready for a party of flavors and spices in your mouth!"}
{"input": "I love this place. The service was awesome and the food, even better. I always hated beets until I had it here. OMG!!! I will only eat beets here. Love!!!"}
{"input": "Had the pizza delivered to the hotel that I was staying and it took 45 mins. The pizzas are large slices and very good. My only problem was it was very oily."}
{"input": "Came in looking for housewares and furniture.  Didn't find anything worth buying."}
{"input": "Pathetic experience with them. I ordered for rava masala dosa and vegetable uttapam to take out. They gave me dosa which is as good as burnt. Packing was so bad that the dosa layer has stuck to the white sheet of wrap. It did not smell good either. I called them and explained the story. I was expecting an apology and someone to provide us with the replacement if not refund but nothing of the sort. They did not even apologize, forget about refund or replacement. i shall be disposing the dosa as is.\nUttapam was not very good either. It tasted sour and cilantro seemed old. I could not take it more than few loaves. Remaining will go in the dustbin as well. \nSuch a disgusting experience with them"}
{"input": "I had called at 630 tonight to see what time they were open until tonight due to the snow. I was told 10. I got there at 830 and even with a packed restaurant they would not seat us because 'they close at 9 tonight' why was I told 10? I also drove about 15-20 min just to get there so waste of time and gas. The fact we were turned away is rude and unprofessional, I get the early closing but maybe  they should inform the girl answering the phone."}
{"input": "I had been hearing nothing but great things about the Block for years and finally made it there for a friend's birthday dinner. It definitely lived up to the hype. We went on a Saturday night and used No Wait to check ourselves in ahead of time. There were a few parties ahead of us when we arrived, but there just so happened to be a table open in the bar, so we sat there. The service was incredible - very attentive, but without even noticing they were there. Our table got the Brussels sprouts to share, and i would go back just for those alone. For our entrees we all ordered a pork dish - two had the braised pork, another had the pork and pappardelle and I had the pork chop. We all tried each other's dishes and my personal favorite was the pork chop. Amazing experience overall and highly recommend."}
{"input": "Great food!\nAmazing customer service!\nA hidden gem within the community, and great location."}
{"input": "If you are looking for customer service, continue looking! Both appointments my partner made on two separate occasions were neglected. What's the point of an appointment if you can't be seen within a reasonable amount of time? Twice, they asked if he could come back in two hours. This review has nothing to do with the quality of hair cut, it's strictly about this business respecting their customer's time."}
{"input": "This is currently my favorite place for takeout! It's priced fairly, delicious and they package it so nicely."}
{"input": "If you want to eat at Prep & Pastry on the weekends, go right when it opens or before it closes. There is always a long wait because of how busy it gets - but the wait is always worth it. The food there is absolutely amazing. I go there often and love the green eggs & ham, bloody marys, and mimosas! They gave me a free pastry on my birthday once, it was delicious! I wish I remembered what it was called. \n\nI also love that they serve EXO coffee here (a local coffee) - nothing better than a great breakfast with great coffee to go with it!"}
{"input": "Today was my first day at this spot, and I loved it! I had my hair cut by Kris, and he was very attentive, listened to what I wanted, and did a fab job! I just love this shorter do! I shall definitely return to him for further hair appointments. Plus he was quite pleasant to chat with. I also had a wax by Crystal, and she was just amazing. Friendly, efficient, and quite meticulous. Really enjoyed my time there and the staff was on point with their service."}
{"input": "Service here was quick and friendly but it was really slow while I was there so who knows if it's always that quick. The menu caters to everyone - vegans, vegetarians, and carnivores. I don't recall any gluten free options but don't quote me on that. The atmosphere is okay but they had way more seating than I expected from the entrance. I ordered the vegan sausage sandwich and I thought it was pretty good. I would probably go back at some point."}
{"input": "I had one of the top three worst restaurant experiences of my life here. One example is that my wife got a lukewarm burrito and sent it back after talking with the manager. The burrito came back partly eaten....by the chef....as the manager said she has the chef taste things when complained about....AND SHE BROUGHT THIS BURRITO BACK TO OUR TABLE...THE MANAGER  (who said she is part of the founding family). This is after waiting more than 90 minutes for our food. On top of that, the food is mediocre at best. Now I've read El Charro is selling burritos at 7-Eleven stores in California....enough said. Do yourself a favor and go to Poco and Mom's or even Guadalajara Grill. El Charro is WAY past its expiration date and those running it now no longer know how to serve excellent, or even decent, Mexican food."}
{"input": "Great atmosphere, above average burgers, but super cool drink selection - both alcoholic and non alcoholic.  They have pretty much every kind of soda style you can think of and some really tasty \"spiked\" shakes.  Definitely a fun place to be at no matter what you're feeling."}
{"input": "Walked here from our condo and found this awesome place! Delicious sliders...donuts...unique drinks... Awesome atmosphere and the staff was sooooooo friendly! Will definitely be back!!!!!"}
{"input": "Beautiful place with an amazing carousel bar. The drinks were great. If you're looking for a perfect place for a slip-n-fall, here it is!"}
{"input": "I ate here with my colleagues after a long day of meetings and we certainly enjoyed the very good food, and even attentive service. I had their gulf fish mahi mahi as an entree and mashed sweet potato as side. Excellent! I finished with the sorbet sampler and that was just right, not too much! I would recommend coming here and then going upstairs to check out their balcony facing Jackson Square."}
{"input": "Lovely little restaurant which was converted from a house...lots of history to this place.  The patio area is romantic and the bar is fun to hang out in. Very good food and surprisingly not expensive. Amazing brunch on Sundays.  You know this place is great when Pamela Anderson, Brad Pitt, Jennifer Aniston, and Bill Belamy (heh heh) have been seen dining there."}
{"input": "Place is okay. They were the only restaurant that was able to accommodate a large party on such short notice. I ordered the black spaghetti that other patrons raved about. It was pretty disgusting. I'm not sure why he had some a weird texture and almost tasted like plastic. I've tried many different types of spaghetti and this by far was the worst plate I've tried. My co-workers said their food was okay though. Maybe it was just what I ordered that sucked. If I'm ever in Nashville again, I'd give them another go. The drinks were on point as expected."}
{"input": "This is my 5th MB i have purchased and i recently had the greatest experience ever with both the dealership and my sales rep Bret. It was a surprise 25th anniversary present for my wife. The vehicle was a special order and to say that all involved went above and beyond, would be an understatement. As i am writing this, I am truly humbled by the way they took care of me. Please keep doing what you guys/girls are doing because it works. Treat people like people and be fair!  I am a customer for life."}
{"input": "The food is quite good (and at a lower price than other, similar popular brunch spots in philly). The stuffed french toast, smoothies, and fries were all delicious. The wait is usually a bit long b/c seating is very limited."}
{"input": "Not impressed. My husband and I decided to try take out this evening from this place. When we got home we opened our daughters spaghetti and meatballs and there was hardly any pasta/sauce and NO meatballs. Frustrating. Hubby had to drive back to the restaurant to get her meal corrected. I'll also add that I think $9 for a kids meals is a bit absurd for PASTA. My fettuccini Alfredo was bland. The portion was small but I never finish all the pasta most places give me so that wasn't a big deal. My husbands tortellini tasted like it was frozen, same with the calamari. Definitely doesn't taste like they use fresh ingredients. I will say they marinara is good but not enough for us to go back. A disappointing experience."}
{"input": "The one thing I really wanted for breakfast while in New Orleans was Grillades. I have made them at home from a recipe but never had them in a restaurant. When Yelp searching this place popped up so it was a must for breakfast. \n\nThe restaurant has a diner style atmosphere. We were seated by the window so we got to watch traffic pass by on Canal Street. Our service was quick and our server was great. \n\nOf course I ordered the Grits and Grillades. Slow roasted beef with peppers and onions in a brown gravy over creamy Gouda cheese grits sounded perfect. It did not disappoint as it was so delicious!  I get excited when I go to a restaurant and order something I've cooked before and it tastes better than mine. This will be a must on any future New Orleans trips."}
{"input": "These guys are the best, I've been putting off this filling for about 5 years and it finally gave in, these guys got me in the same day were quite affordable seeing as I do not have insurance, the staff was lovely as was the dentist, quick and good work. I couldn't thank them enough."}
{"input": "Horrible for the most part. \n\nI ordered $50 worth of food and 27 was eatable\n\nThe fried rice was soapy \nThe duck bun that was $8 alone was gross and I love duck \nThe sushi was $5 for two pieces I ordered $15 worth 6 pieces it had next to no rice but the fish was awesome very fresh that alone gave them the two stars I would give half a star for the miso \n\nHe ordered a sushi roll he said it was pretty good again the fish was great 1star for this review \n\nI won't go back because I would rather drive to Tampa and go to I ai sushi for cheaper higher quality food."}
{"input": "If you ever want brunch on the weekends, then this is the destination. The dishes are so cultural and succulent. I always get the eggs benedict, but the chicken and waffles are also top notch. I would give it a 5 star, but I haven't ate anything on the lunch or dinner menu. However, their brunch is definitely 5 stars."}
{"input": "Service was ok, but the food was excellent.  Nothing against our sweet server, but she was alone on a 20 person table - really? I completely blame that one on management! \n\nBuffalo cauliflower was awesome and the chicken skewers were so so good!  Everyone had a wonderful time! \n\nAmbiance was so fun!"}
{"input": "Typical Mongolian style restaurant with lots of options and a fun twist on dining."}
{"input": "The best Szechuan food I have had in center city~\n\nTheir food is spicy, yet amazingly flavorful and the ambiance is sure to encourage a fun conversation with those you share your meal with (you'll definitely need a glass of water the first time you visit to handle the sexy heat). For what is expected of Chinese food, it is on the pricier side, but all well worth it.  My favorite recommendations include Dan Dan noodles, Dry Pepper Chicken/Shrimp, and Cumin Lamb.  The service can be slow during busier days such as Friday/Saturday/Sunday, but the waiters/waitresses are very friendly making the wait forgivable."}
{"input": "Acme in Flourtown is good for a small local grocery store. It's clean, has a fairly decent layout and selection and the staff is pretty good. If you're looking to grab something quick it's the best option close by. (The Genuardis in Flourtown and Acme in Ft Washington both kinda suck)\n\nHowever, If you're looking to do some heavy, stocking up, grocery shopping you're probably better off heading somewhere else."}
{"input": "AMAZING food. Make sure you make a reservation for the weekends. This is a BYOB and the wait is worth it. Their pastas are sooooooooo good. I LOVE the gnocchi Fellini but I get it w/ Linguini. One plate of pasta will fill up two people w/ leftovers."}
{"input": "The Shop is an amazing space! Their attention to detail and services are unbelievable. Plenty of places to have private meetings as well as post up and get work done."}
{"input": "I stop in here fairly often for lunch. The person who I think may be the owner is always so friendly and so sweet. It's a small place, but it's always busy and service is fast. \n\nMy favorite meal is the hummus and veggie wrap that they sometimes have on special. The grilled cheese with tomato soup is always good. Actually, all of their sandwiches are pretty awesome. The salads are also very delicious. The bacon is actually made to order, so it's not dried out or deep fried. \n\nI hope this place continues to do well."}
{"input": "This place is known for their 'free' margaritas, which really just means that the food is overpriced to include alcohol cost. We were a party of 6, so they sent over two servers to take our order. Both servers nodded and said that they understood when I said that I had a dairy allergy and couldn't have any on my food. We asked for one order of chips and salsa for the table (REALLY overpriced)\nMy dish arrived, smothered in cream sauce. I asked to see the owner and explained it all to him, and he apologized and brought out another plate, 20 minutes later.\nWhen we got the check, we found that they had brought us THREE orders of chips and salsa, with 3 orders of guac, which we didn't ask for- they saw three couples and decided to up the order on their own. \n\nOverall, if you have allergies, I'd say stay away from this place due to the language barrier. And if you do go, make sure that you double check on the order so you don't get cheated."}
{"input": "Great concept, inventory is always changing, affordable prices, and all while helping New Orleans to be GREEN!"}
{"input": "A bit off the beaten path for most tourists, as it is in the Marigny, but worth the trip. Sure, the place is not perfect, but there are ultra-expensive restaurants in the FQ that are also not perfect. Look, cheap food, especially food this good, gives \"wiggle\" room for imperfections.\n\nBreakfast served all day is a bonus. Sometimes you just got to have a lox omelet (under $10) late in the day. The restaurant boasts vegetarian and *gasp* vegan dishes, but someone needs to tell them that cheese doesn't fit into either of those categories. That aside, the french fry poboy, and the mac 'n cheese sandwiches are amazing. So is the Saturday Blue Plate of BBQ Chicken legs. \n\nEvery entree is under $10, well except for the Friday Blue Plate, but why quibble? And who can argue with $5 Bloody Mary's, especially ones that are this good?"}
{"input": "We all had a great time. We went to watch the football game. We ordered wings, onion rings, and drinks. The server was great, the food was great!! Food on time, drinks on time as well. All tv's were working, sound system was great. We sat outside, and had a great time! It's not our 1st time here, and we love it!!"}
{"input": "We were visiting Nashville for business and everyone raved about this place so we had to try it. This is an average BBQ joint. The service and food were good but nothing like the hype."}
{"input": "First off have to give the service and amazing rant. The waitress whom I believe was the owner was friendly, helpful and a pleasure. She asked how everything was if we needed refills in timely manners and was genuine. I got the goulash, spatzle and red cabbage. The food was very tasty seasoned well and presentation was down hone style but appealing to the eyes. I was full but took home a slice of black forrest chocolate cherry cake which was great. I would highly recommend the restaurant and I will be back."}
{"input": "I needed stucco and a small repair on my side steps.  Alston Stucco was on time and professional.  The job they did was excellent.  Even friends who are retired contractors said the job was done extremely well."}
{"input": "I'm glad that Michael & Lucy found a way to open up another family restaurant after years at Tony's on Linden (now closed following an ugly family dispute). The food is good and the prices are reasonable (ask about the slice and salad special). The Tuscany design is pleasant as are the owners (Lucy is always sweet and friendly). They have local beer on tap (Figueroa, Island Brew and others), 3 HD sports TVs inside, one HD sports TV outside for patio diners, a TV dedicated to surf videos and a TV dedicated to kids shows (and a classic old family friendly Ms Pac-Man game that was a hit with 2 kids when I was there). It's a tough location but I hope they make it work. Santa Claus Lane seems to be having a bit of a Renaissance after many years of being known mostly for outdated kitschy roadside attractions. Good luck!"}
{"input": "I've only eaten at Cosi when I travel. I've eaten at this location a few times. I like their flatbreads and salads. \nThere bbq chicken Flatbread is good. It's a pretty good portion size too."}
{"input": "Here on vacation the Biglot on Lemmon Rocks!!  So organized and everything I needed at great price."}
{"input": "Great food and the staff are some of the best \nBest tequila selection in town\nBest value \nMy go to place for Mexican food \nThanks \nJeff in Fishers"}
{"input": "The staff is what makes this place great. It is frustrating dealing with the corporate office but Mike always takes care of us. We have had several windshield's replaced here as well as two hard to find side windows on an 84 Toyota. Mike is trustworthy and doesn't take advantage of people and that is worth it's weight in gold. Stop in and talk with them and they will take care of you with kindness and respect. They even do on site repairs and everyone I have dealt with have been great. Keep up the hard work team!"}
{"input": "This place was a wonderful find for a late-night meal! We were at Chaifetz Arena for a concert on Saturday night and were hoping to find somewhere to eat in walking distance so that we didn't have to drive and hunt. It was 11pm so the first place we tried had already closed their kitchen. We then decided to try The Fountain. We were pleasantly surprised to be cheerily welcomed in and told the kitchen was open. And not only was the kitchen open but the menu options were great! As a vegetarian I was pleasantly suprised to find multiple options. I went with a veggie hummus sandwich on a unique and delicious bread. They had several unique and healthy side options as well. After a fairly healthy meal, we decided we could treat ourselves to the chocolate banana malt and it was fantastic! I am very glad we found the Fountain! In addition to the great menu, the decor is really cool and the staff was wonderful!"}
{"input": "Great food, great drinks. Try the fried mozzarella or the black bean burger. Delicious."}
{"input": "Would give it five stars except for one thing. First off, the food was great. Party of ten and everyone liked what they ordered. Our waitress provided quick and friendly service. She was great. Losing a star for the hostess. Told it would be 45-60 minutes for a booth to accommodate a party our size. Not a problem. Then I see three tables on the outdoor patio. I tell the hostess we would take those and they don't have to move them they are close enough that we would be good. She tells me she had to get with the manager. Holy crap you have to ask the manager ??  What, to accommodate customers and feed them in a restaurant ?  She came back and moved the tables together, which we didn't ask her to do. And man was she ever pissed about it. She didn't say anything but you could see it on her face."}
{"input": "Not a good experience. Won't go again. Weak, misguided service.Needs some more training by management. No Hostess or Greeter at entry.  Waiters and waitresses all around spent more time cleaning table tops with spray bottles and filthy cloths in their hands then tending to present customers eating their meal. No consideration. Music blaring. Kids running wild on Kids Eat-Free -Night.  Poor choice in seating - ppl without children seated right next to the Free Color and Scribble Table\n ( didn;t know it was kids night until too late. Awful. Never again)  Worse than a poorly run loud cafeteria vibe with roaming , unsupervised kids.  Waiter forgot to bring an ordered side dish, yet had it on the bill, of course. Took extra time to remove it. Lighting was much too bright. Food was mediocre to taste.  Overall disappointing, and will not go back."}
{"input": "As with all Publix locations I have been to in Florida over the years, this store is much older than the stores in Nashville - and it shows. Despite the age of the building and shelves, this store was clean.\n\nIt seems smaller since the stores here also carry a large selection of beach-going items, and have an aisle solely for wine. Somehow it is all cram-packed in there...neatly.\n\nI thought the produce section at this location was very tastefully displayed and well-stocked. \n\nThe staff was not engaging, but when asked, helpful."}
{"input": "Wow new ownership and they don't care about customers that's for sure.dont go here for lunch or if you are in a hurry.\nI think this location won't last long with the attitude they have here ..."}
{"input": "If you like lobster this is the place. Great prices great service and great food. Very casual dining.\n\nBack again to enjoy the Lobster special w 1  1/4 lb lobster,1 # mussels and 1-2# steamers with corn and potatoes for $19.99. See photo. \nClam chowder so good as is the Ucon lobster roll covered in melted butter."}
{"input": "Great crab  soup. But too much cheese.   Service the best. Unfortunately music started at 930.   The ground were gorgeous. Would of loved to sit outside."}
{"input": "La Copa is a good store that carries soccer jerseys. Whether you are looking for international or Euro jersey's this is a pretty good spot.\n\nThey also carry training clothes and soccer gear but it's best for jerseys. I found they didn't have to big of a selection and the most popular jerseys are always sold out here or not in stock. \n\nYou'd probably have better luck at a place like Free Kick or even ordering online."}
{"input": "I've come here two days in a row, it's that good. I got the cookies and milk donut the first day and it was delicious! Not too sweet and very well fried outside with almost a crunch, and the inside of the donut is fluffy and awesome. $2.75 post-tax for that. The second day I got a glazed and a buttermilk drop, each $1.65 post-tax. The buttermilk drop was really crispy on the outside but I could taste the oil a bit. It was too fried I think. Inside was chewy like a cake donut which was good. The glazed donut had an interesting taste to it, still good consistency though! Definitely recommend, would come again!"}
{"input": "I'm only giving this hospital two stars because my mom's primary care dr is on staff there and he's great. But the rest of this place is for the birds."}
{"input": "$0.75 oysters everyday 3-6 pm! This is a great deal if you like P&J oysters. We also ordered the crawfish bisque which was creamy smooth. We shared the rib eye entree, seasoned well and came with decent fries. There was some lulls in the service."}
{"input": "Ordered delivery from here recently. I was able to order online which I liked. The food came pretty quickly and was exactly what I ordered. Unfortunately, the food was not very good. Ordered an orange chicken, mongolian beef, a shrimp dish plus some soups and egg rolls. There's so many other chinese food joints in the area, and nothing stands out about this place at all."}
{"input": "A beautiful setting but the food doesn't live up to the surroundings.  In particular, my wife had the Sauteed Fresh Gulf Fish and was disappointed by the fishy flavor.  Very little else of what we had that day stood out.\n\nAdd to that a bit too much of a \"the chef prefers that you order all your food at once\" type of attitude that detracted from the enjoyment.  Last I checked, the customer should have some say in how a meal gets paced.\n\nI'll pass."}
{"input": "So far I've been sitting here wanting to dine in for about 30 minutes and have yet to see a waitress. Had to finally get up from my table and go order a pizza and drinks from the front counter. There are two waitresses and about 5 tables of families. The waitresses are lazy and would rather stand around talking to friends than wait on a table. The girl just told the next family that came in here that it would be a better idea if they ordered to go than to dine in! LOL what a joke! This place is crap. Don't bother trying to eat here. Get delivery instead."}
{"input": "Got yelled at to close the door...as I was walking in....I guess they didn't want my business."}
{"input": "Great neighborhood pet supply store. We are able to pick up all the necessities for our little dog at reasonable prices. Everyone is friendly. They have promotions from time to time. Check their Facebook page."}
{"input": "I am so excited to have somewhere to get an acai bowl on the weekends when I am not in center city! I have tried the Boostin Bowl and the Banana Split Bowl and both were great! Everything is fresh and delicious. \n\nI would agree that the menu is a little pricey, but I don't mind paying extra to support a local business. Plus, there's a puppy to greet you at the door."}
{"input": "Had the Spring onion soup. Could not eat it. \nMuch too salty. Much too spicy hot and I like hot. The General Tso's wings were ok but too much sauce- drenched in sauce. My husband had the pulled mushroom sandwich. Funny taste. Guess we will not be back.  Noise level very very loud too. Sorry to have to write this because we like to patronize local places. They are very busy so I guess we are of a minority opinion"}
{"input": "I love coming here! Food is great and the service is what I'd expect coming to an lower-end Indian restaurant. The portions are so large I always have enough for 2-3 meals after!"}
{"input": "We had a great experience.  Visiting from dc, near our Valley Forge hotel.  Pizzas were great, appetizers, chicken cutlets and the specials of the day all on display at the front of the restaurant were amazing.  Need to come back and try the fresh pastas! Tiramisu was amazing! Definitely a great experience."}
{"input": "I was just visiting St Louis/Clayton for a business trip. I was referred to Sauce on the Side by a colleague. It is amazing to say the least. The food is fresh and creative. I ate there 3 times that week! Super friendly staff. They even gave me the low down on the local beers!  Love 4HandsBrewing by the way!"}
{"input": "The tiki bar has a great outdoor music venue, and the inside bar can be a fantastic time if  you want it to be.  They had on stage some of the most talented musicians I had ever heard.  They were very versatile, playing all kinds of music from rock, to dance, to hip hop, to oldies.  The dance floor is packed with enthusiastic tourists just having the time of their life.  I also love the bar area, they have all kinds of microbrewery beers on draft, and a full liquor bar with somewhat reasonable prices.  It's an excellent way to spend a night in Clearwater Beach."}
{"input": "Cool place if anyone would wait on you.  Hung around for 15 minutes and watched the bartender and wait staff chat at the bar.  There's plenty of places to drink in the casino.\n\nI find it strange how Peppermill prices identical food and drink items differently between establishments in the casino."}
{"input": "Amazing new find! Small cute cafe with VERY reasonable prices for delicious food. I tried the egg on Gouda crepe with bacon which was delicious and well stuffed. I just wish the Gouda taste was a bit stronger and that there was some type of sauce to go with it. The caramel ricotta crepe was DELICIOUS and very well prepared. I'll definitely be coming back to try the rest of their menu!"}
{"input": "Beautiful lobby, average rooms.  Staff up front are very nice (as mentioned in previous reviews), but they don't have enough staff to keep rooms up.  Not enough space in bathroom to hang up towels and cleaning staff don't get around until 3 or after."}
{"input": "Great bowls & sauce. All of the ingredients were fresh and healthy. Service was great. I'm going to become a regular at this place."}
{"input": "Finally made it down for brunch today, and loved everything.  Great service, great mimosas.  Food was amazing.  We ordered the loaded biscuits and gravy, sweet potato hash, and 'chicken' & waffles.   So delicious.  Would LOVE to see a kids' menu at brunch.  The regular portion is a bit too much food, and a little pricy, for our 6yr old. But it tasted good, so we helped eat his meal. :) \n\nWill absolutely be back. Try the noochy grits and the braised kale!  Yum!"}
{"input": "There was a reason this place had plenty of open tables while the rest of the boardwalk was packed.  We should have just waited. The staff was friendly. Not overly helpful but friendly. Food was tolerable. Typical fried fish, shrimp, baked potato sides. Certainly nothing worth the prices nor worth wasting a meal. Keep walkin"}
{"input": "We took a tour at 2 pm and it was a great way to start, the brew place is interesting on how they make all the manic happen with their amazing brews.  I generally love the saisons but the sumo stout and abraxas stout were top notch and would drink more If didn't have to drive.  Stouts were so smooth, flavorful!  Love this place"}
{"input": "Pass this place all the time always wanted to stop by and try it out. i got the chance to go and DEFINITELY ENJOYED the sushi and complementary dessert. Waitress was very nice. I have to definitely come here again"}
{"input": "I've lived in Santa Barbara for awhile now, and somehow haven't stumbled upon this gem..... until.... I did. And wow. Like shh stop. Wow. This place is bomb. Go here. Prices are reasonable for the dank sushi supplied. You won't be disappointed."}
{"input": "I don't think there is anything in this place that is particularly healthy, but I can't get enough of their pork belly slider - fantastic.  Donuts are really fine too.  A good lunch spot."}
{"input": "Average or slightly above, despite the hype.  On the expensive side.  For $10 or $12 you should get fries with your burger, not a large to share for $8.  I had a bison burger. that was the only reason I went there.  Seems we had 1 beer, 1 iced tea, 1 burger, 1 bison burger and split a large fry, for about $37.  Rather ridiculous. And they try to hard to be different or interesting, but ruin a good meal.  The bison burger was tainted with unnecessary slaw and BBQ on it to call it a Carolina bison burger.  Not worth $12 on its own.\n\nBeen there.  Done that.  No reason to go back.  Next..."}
{"input": "Over-priced and poor quality. I bought a 3k couch which took 12 weeks to build from BoConcept in Philly. The couch had structural problems after 3 months! Customer service was very disorganized and communicated very poorly. I would not buy anything from this company again. Horrible support, high prices and poor quality. STAY AWAY!"}
{"input": "The hubby and I have been here on multiple occasions and we have loved every part of the meal, every single time. Everyone from the servers to the bartender is very knowledgable about the menu and was able to immediately recommend items I could eat as-is, substitute or delete to make something safe for this Celiac girl to eat. The wine and cocktail menus are spot on. The food divine.  My only wish is that they would have a gluten-free dessert, we've always had to go elsewhere for something sweet. But that is not a big deal and I still want to go here time and time again."}
{"input": "First off, it is a bar through and through. The alcohol selection is good and the drinks well mixed. It is also a casino bar, so you'll be paying higher than average prices. There is a small food menu, but the selection isn't that great. To add insult to injury the food made me ill. The reviews about service aren't exaggerations. We, too, practically had to tackle our server to order food and drinks many of times. Not my preferred place to go when there are so many better options in Reno."}
{"input": "Nice hotel, room was very nice and clean, staff nice. Reason for the one star is the elevator. DO NOT get a room by the elevator, you can hear it and it is very loud with lots of banging. Unless you like a loud thud every 20-30 seconds, do not stay here. They put us in a room by the elevator and it's impossible to sleep."}
{"input": "Taste is individual, and this reviewer thinks the fro-yo tastes great.  The flavors and consistencies are just right for the following I have tried: vanilla, strawberry-banana, coconut, mango, lychee, almond, and pistachio.  The toppings are fine and the people working there seem pleasant.  Like the outdoor seating.\n\nThe downside is the layout inside -- it is cramped and narrow.  It makes navigation difficult (esp. with a stroller).\n\nMake sure you get the Tutti Fruitti card punched out with each purchase!"}
{"input": "My husband and I went to Andre Richard Salon today for the first time. We happily followed Kate, our stylist from Chester County, to her new home at the salon. \n\n I found Kate three years ago and stayed because in that time I've always gotten exactly what I've asked for in cuts and color. It was well worth the trip to the city!\n\nAlso, everyone in the salon was very nice!"}
{"input": "Great food and great environment. Awesome pros the room if you wanted to have a private party"}
{"input": "Went to dinner while in the Santa Barbara /Montecito area for memorial day weekend. We made reservations but we arrived earlier and we're seated right away. The chips and salsa were moving the corn sauce is really fresh. The drinks were strong and delicious. Service was amazing dinner was incredible."}
{"input": "I had the Entrecôte Grillée et Frites (picture included) and my wife had the Boudin Stuffed Porkchop. Both meals were amazing. In addition, we walked in on a Friday at 5pm with no reservation and were seated immediately. \n\nThe only negative comment is the that the wait staff seemed stretched a little thin. We got our drink orders and it was probably 10-15mins before they came back to see if we were ready to order. I even noticed the couple next to us also trying to get the wait staffs attention so they could pay their bill.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience and we plan to come back in the near future."}
{"input": "This is actually the first negative review I've ever written because I've never had an experience bad enough to warrant one. Shit happens sometimes. I'll also preface this by saying I've dined here many times with no issue. Unfortunately, I won't be dining from here any longer. My order tonight was literally inedible. The crab rangoon tasted like the cream cheese had turned, the soup didn't taste like anything at all and there were several undercooked pieces of chicken in my fried rice. Even after realizing this, I had no intention of writing a negative review because like I stated above, shit happens. However, I changed my mind after I called to request a refund (because being served undercooked chicken warrants a refund in my opinion) and I was told I couldn't get one because \"they didn't know how to do a refund on the credit card machine.\" I was then offered a $20 gift certificate to compensate me for my $32 order, which is laughable."}
{"input": "Was wandering the streets of Philly and came across this restaurant.  Realizing I hadn't eaten all day I stopped off to grab a sandwich.  I immediately fell in love with the atmosphere and the staff was amazing and friendly.  \n\nSitting alone enjoying the view, a glass of proseco, and my amazing turkey sandwich; the staff checked in and offered light banter.  \n\nVery impressed and highly recommend."}
{"input": "There are bars you can still smoke in?! Yuck. Sorry smokers (I used to be one so I get it) but yuck. The stink of smoke in my hair woke me up in the middle of the night after stopping in here and was so bad I had to get up to wash it before I could get back to sleep. That's not good.\n\nDefinitely a dive, this bar is very dim and smokey. The bartender was friendly and came to take my order as soon as I walked up to the bar. The bloody mary I ordered wasn't that great or strong, though.  That's not good either."}
{"input": "Spent way too much money to get actually spoiled food delivered to us. Ordered a huge order, over 50% of it was incorrect. Will never return to this location."}
{"input": "short ugly girl has Bad customer service! \nI don't recommend this place at all, they won't give you your money back if you do an early cancellation!!"}
{"input": "Bryan atthe Terrance Lounge in Tuscany Towers is the best! My wife and I i will recommend Peppermill to everyone we know due to his outstanding customer service!"}
{"input": "WHOOPS!  Good food, but, other than pizza, served a la carte.  I would have enjoyed the experience more if the food was cooked to order.  Service was very quick.  In fact, too quick, which took a lot of romance out of an otherwise enjoyable date night.  Ava might be a better lunch place instead of a dinner night out place.  I understand they also do lunch."}
{"input": "bar menu and seating was great, Nola traditional experience. Lobster roll terrific - light and fresh. We'll be back."}
{"input": "Such a great place for gifts, NV themes and other homemade items, plus antiques, beautiful artwork of all types, etc. In a new location but still in the same mall, just a much bigger store - check it out!!"}
{"input": "Great food... Love the Fish tacos & Nachos are great  it's really a nice atmosphere for family settings and night or dates too.. Music beach bar, home made ice cream  & a little play ground - it's great"}
{"input": "Try the bouquet tea tonics-  they're delicious! The mochas are also very yummy and the artwork on top of the mocha is cool! The lavender latte was awesome too! If you're in Reno, don't miss it!"}
{"input": "Excellent service. Sent a request online and within 30-45 mins had a call back. Got the spot scheduled. Shanna was Prompt on arrival, very informative with prevention and such.\nChecked both mine and my daughters head. Full treatment on both. \nIt is a bit pricey but I already had one round and was over it all. The off the shelf stuff just doesn't work. \nThe comb they use is not available in stores and gathers the nits way better. \nOnly complaint is the comb should be included in the session not extra. I bought it cause I wanted to have the proper tools in case of a next time."}
{"input": "Worst dinner ever. Place was empty and the not so friendly greeter asked us 3 times how many people were in our party. Then we waited 15 min for our sever, another 15 for her to bring us water. Dinner took 30 min to arrive , again place was empty.  The food was terrible."}
{"input": "Buddy Brew is a very trendy coffee shop based in Tampa. Their coffee is flavorful and their presentation is nice. I really liked the fact that their lattes and cappuccinos have beautiful latte art on top. The store has a beautiful modern design that reminds me of coffee shops in New York. \n\nThis particular location is in Hyde Park Village. The benefit is that parking is free. The down side is that seating is limited. The store is also extremely cold, so it is uncomfortable to sit and socialize for very long. You may be better off getting your coffee to go and walking around Hyde Park Village instead."}
{"input": "Best sushi in Tampa bay! So fresh and great service, and they have an awesome lunch special."}
{"input": "I would have given 5 stars in the past (and probably would give 5 stars to the chestnut location), but recently I feel there's been a decline in quality.  I went in recently and their signature crispy ranch was soggy with no crunch.  Their fries were great, well seasoned.  Yet I felt the entire meal wasn't worth the 14.50.  \n\nI did have to walk 3 blocks, which may have caused some of the issue with the sandwich.  The fries and good customer service save this from being 3 stars in my mind, but the price prevents it from a 5 star.  Avoid peak hours."}
{"input": "The chorizo tacos are amazing!!! We also tried the carne asada and shrimp tacos, amazing as well. The potato taquitos had great flavor and the service was excellent!"}
{"input": "This restaurant smells like old, sour maple syrup. It's been ten hours and I can still smell it. \nThe food was terrible. I have no clue how this restaurant is in business. The eggs were mushy, slimy, and very watery. I took a few bites, but the flavor was so bad I couldn't eat anymore. I just can't understand how a restaurant that specializes in cooking eggs can be so bad at it. The potatoes were also gross, tasted like old dirty potatoes that were microwaved. \nThe coffee was really weak, too. It tasted like watered down tea. \nI just can't stress enough how bad this restaurant is. Even the flower in the case on our table was dead. Stay away!!!!!\nI will say, the waiter and manager were very nice and friendly."}
{"input": "This location has a drive-up window... great for when you call your order in ahead of time!  Also, this one is the only Papa Murphy's I've been to whose pizzas are always round (never wonky).  Nice employees, too!\n\nAnother plus at this location: a frequent-buyer stamp card!\n\nWe like the De-Lite pizzas, and the creamy garlic sauce can be a tasty change from the usual red."}
{"input": "Fabulous! Best happy hour, fresh menu, Delish- drinks, if I had the time, I'd come here every day!"}
{"input": "Hotel was overcrowded and lost our reservation it seems. We had to pay extra for a suite so we could sleep together the taxes alone are a reason not to stay. They just add tax after tax. Could never get to the carousel bar as it was way too crowded. What's the point of staying here, couldn't get a drink and ended up getting room service several times because the streets were too crowded and smelled like piss never again New Orleans."}
{"input": "Had dinner here last night, filet skewers were excellent.  Our dinners were ribeye and filet both were perfect, tasty, cooked to perfection, had great accompanying sauces of bernaise and bbq. Our waitress, Lisa, was very helpful, she knew all of their menu and helped us select terrific choices. Steaks were one of the best we have had, cud dos to the chef.  Can't wait to return."}
{"input": "Small restaurant in the casino. 4 stars because there isn't much service. You order at the counter and they deliver the food to you. Busing of the tables were slow as well. However the food we ordered was great! I had the fried oyster platter and it was really good. We also ordered the charbroiled oysters and they were AMAZING!!!!"}
{"input": "Great service.  The chicken fajita quesadilla is awesome... grilled onions are amazing."}
{"input": "Top rate service,  nice ambiance,  friendly staff.  We were taken care of from the moment we sat down.  Loved every second.  Good was just as good.  Splurge for the wagyu filet, it's worth it.  As for appetizers, the Kung pao calamari was one of the more intetesting appetizers I have had in awhile,  i loved it.  Amazing sauce. Top marks all around"}
{"input": "A consistent chain when you want some decent seafood.  Standard chain décor with good service and good food.  We tried the venison stuffed mushrooms, sweet potato tots, tuna steak wasabi, fried grouper and key lime Mahi.  All dishes were well prepared and tasty.  Never had a problem or complaint with this chain."}
{"input": "We've been here three times and on each visit Djorn has taken excellent care of us. (I may have said \"Better than family\" once.) This was definitely a great break after lots of walking and the new grey robes feel AMAZING. Make sure to check out the saltwater pool and hot tub, too."}
{"input": "If you're in the Warehouse District anyway (perhaps you're on your way to Cochon, which would be wise of you), not a bad spot to visit. If you're in the mood for an expensive novelty cocktail, which will undoubtedly be strong, bright, and maybe include a prop such as a plastic shark, holy moly are you in the right place."}
{"input": "Very nice restaurant in the heart of downtown St. Petersburg with a nice homey feel to it. The burgers full of flavor and the arugula is a fine touch to the chicken and potato gratin meal.  I was not a fan of the cheese used in the potatoes gratin but will definitely be. Ack for the burger. Wine was a little high priced so I didn't get any. The atmosphere is very nice and so was our waitress."}
{"input": "I have read some of the other reviews and should have read them before trying this place.  Eating should be enjoyable.  I have started eating at Jade Garden at Hillsborough and Habana.  Definitely worth the drive to get some quality Chinese food."}
{"input": "What else can be said about this place?  I've been to St. Elmo's, and never could have imagined the place working as a more casual american restaurant.   Well, they pulled it off.\n\nCome in for their lunch, which offers a combo of a half sandwich (prime rib, yes please!) with classic sides.  And hey, their dinner offers basically the same menu as St. Elmo's just incase that is booked for the night.\n\nWorth the visit"}
{"input": "Oh how I love a good salad! Oh how I love a good soup! Oh who doesn't love a good Mac and cheese! \n\nI finally stopped in with my son for a quick lunch and was immediately impressed by the menu items! Fresh salads, soups sandwiches and Mac and cheese! \n\nMy shrimp and avocado salad was huge and made with lemon basil vinaigrette. The salad was fresh and the shrimp was perfectly cooked. I had to get a take home container it was so big! \n\nThe Mac and cheese was impressive. I got the 5 cheese. The béchamel was a nice creamy, consistency. The top had a nice brown crust. I especially like that it wasn't topped with bread crumbs, but instead topped with a bit of cheddar. It may not be better than my homemade Mac and cheese, but it was good!\n\nI tried my son's tomato basil soup and it was delish! What a great presentation! I think there was a little creme fraiche on top for garnish.\n\nI can't wait to come back and try more of the menu!"}
{"input": "Good on the 'getting away from straws' for environmental reasons! Not so good on ingredients in ur mixers! Not so impressed with bar girlZzzz energy Saturday eve... Her Margarita getZ 2 thUmbs DOWN...  ItZ kind of an easy drink..."}
{"input": "Not opening in Monday and if you want to order pizza call over an hour in advance! Always great service, and the pizza is amazing!"}
{"input": "I've been visiting Butler Toyota for at least 8 years now. Their customer service greatly improved over the years. \nFriendly personnel, they explain what they'd do with the car, how much upfront costs are and how long it would take them to fix it. They get their job done on time. \nThey could've refreshed their coffee more often. Brian the manager is nice and friendly.\nLast time one of our back lights were out and they replaced it free of charge. Maybe because I spent a large amount on my repair bill. Not sure but they treat customers better than Lexus dealership down the road lol."}
{"input": "I come here all the time never had a problem. Not sure what the other reviewers are talking about. Yes the store has aged but they do try and keep it looking its best. Never had a problem and i still enjoy my Kmart exp."}
{"input": "Really good hamburgers.  Good menu with lots to choose from.  Relaxed atmosphere, good bar, great patio.  Excellent service!!"}
{"input": "This is the best Thai food I've found in the Nashville area. This is a very authentic Thai restaurant and I would highly recommend it."}
{"input": "LOVE imperial. best snoballs around. anna and maddie are the best employees. also we stan frank."}
{"input": "I live in Manhattan, but I visit New Orleans a lot. I love it there, and every time I'm in town, I make sure to go to Blue Dream Vintage. They always have awesome clothing, and obviously put a lot of time in curating what they bring into the shop. I always find something cute that is a one of a kind piece, but relevant to contemporary fashion. Well done, guys! I get compliments on my clothes every time I wear them! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"input": "My family was drawn into Rotten Ralph's by their good Happy Hour prices. We got appetizers and the food was fine - not great but typical. The issue came when we got our bill. The prices were all messed up and apparently our waitress had given us the wrong food. Ultimately though it was resolved."}
{"input": "New place, good wings, good sauces. \nNo 5 stars: bathroom smells and no napkins. Only a giant paper towel roll, not very clean. \nCustomer service is hit and miss. \nAgain new place, management should get the process down in a few months. I will post again then."}
{"input": "Better quality than your typical Indian buffet. My kids love the butter chicken. Lamb Vindaloo and chicken tikka masala are excellent."}
{"input": "My husband and I go here often and we have yet to have a bad meal.  Love this place! Wonderful service, wonderful food, wonderful everything! Worth your time!!"}
{"input": "Very good chicken. The baked beans were not sweet enough for me though. Garlic fries were good. Service was pleasant and didn't hover. I appreciate that. Very good chicken joint"}
{"input": "Starbucks...so aren't they all just clones?  a review would be futile if you've already visited one before.  Coffee is ...OK.  It's more like coffee flavored water to me, but does the trick when called upon.  I much prefer some home brewed New Orleans style coffee & chicory.  Chicory makes the coffee... Starbuckathons have no clue what real coffee is like."}
{"input": "This place is a treat. I found this place on yelp during my trip to the beloved Nola. It was a last stop on Christmas Eve. It was very elegant and exquisite. The wine was good in quality and flavor. The food was very fresh and delectable. I tried the pate and it was a culinary experience. That ended up being my main meal since my sweetheart did not want any. I also tried the bread pudding which was amazing. The ice cream was made fresh. The drizzling and pecans  where the best part. I can't wait to go back and try more offerings."}
{"input": "Quaint, cozy and clean. The Boudin ain't boudin in the traditional sense. The hard brown rice chewy casing and under seasoned pork lacking any hint of Cajun seasoning was way off the mark.  The saving grace was the beef and onion over coconut rice, the cordial owner/cook and nice renevation of the space."}
{"input": "Ordered delivery through Postmates to be delivered to our hotel room. The delivery guy was very very friendly. However, the restaurant did not pack any utensils or napkins. Please be mindful when you are packing the food."}
{"input": "This is our second time at sassafras. The first time we were meeting someone and the food was great along with customer service so we decided to revisit. The customer service was excellent! Food is so well seasoned. My husband is a catfish fanatic and he gives this place a thumbs up!"}
{"input": "Solid rice and fresh vegetables. Pricey for what you get, although understandable given that the location is on South St. Also try the panjeon (Korean pancake) and yukgaejang (beef stew) on a cold winter day. Small restaurant, seems like most people take their food to go. Very friendly staff."}
{"input": "best chinese/taiwanese/fusion in reno, hands down. definitely try the more unique stuff like the sandwiches and pancakes, but the old standbys are also good. can't really be beat for quality and the price is reasonable too. plus.... boba tea. yum."}
{"input": "This is the best food I've had the whole time we've been at Nashville. In all seriousness the avocado toast with the home fries was the best I've ever had. The staff is amazing and we didn't have to wait  for a table. I wish we could eat this every day of our lives. Also my soy latte was AMAZING."}
{"input": "The staff at wheel tech is very friendly but dropped the ball when I had a vehicle in for tire replacement. I dropped the car off around 10 in the morning, the employee that took care of me said that it should be about 2-3 hours. I decided I could go grab some lunch burn a bit of time and come back. As it turned out I ended up getting busy and came back for the car at 4 o'clock. When I walked in the door I was surprised to find that the replacement tire was not even in the building yet. Luckily it showed up about 20 minutes later and I was of the store by 5. \n\nI gave this 2 stars because of the slow service. Also if you have my car all day and then you run late gettnig it back to me perhaps you could clean the wheels off before returning the car. Stepping up the service a bit would have earned you couple more stars."}
{"input": "King Crap Legs were dry.  Scallops weren't that great.   Quiet expensive for the quality that wasn't there.    I was looking forward to it and I wanted to like it but oh well."}
{"input": "Great place to go for the price! Really awesome military discount and the standard prices are pretty reasonable as well. I've only shot pistol here but its definitely been great."}
{"input": "Cute place right by the beach. I ordered the grouper sandwich. The sandwich was rather skimpy on the fish, but the waffle fries were great."}
{"input": "Really enjoyed the meal here. I had the General Tsao chicken and it was delicious. My wife loved her Curry Chicken as well. The portions were reasonable as was the price. The customer service was all very good. We ate there and they brought the food to our table. There is not a lot of seating, but there is some for eating in. I am sure that we will be back again."}
{"input": "Best put together rooms I've been to so far. Directions were clear. We did the Bank room it was really cool. I liked hearing all the statistics after we finished. When we needed clues they didn't just tell us they slipped pictures under the door to help you so you still had to figure it out. I liked that a lot. Pretty awesome experience."}
{"input": "Merritt A. saved the day for us!  Earlier in the day, we had someone who \"attempted\" to change out two toilet flanges and flush handles.  This inept person botched the job terribly!  He started leaks, when there were no leaks. When he finally left, we immediate called Lee Company.  They sent out Merritt right away.  Merritt fixed the problems on both toilets right away.  No more leaks, no more problems!  He fixed the nightmare this other private individual created.  Thank you, Merritt!  Call Lee Company - they are true professionals!"}
{"input": "1st time at Bagger daves in this area. I've always loved their burgers. They have a new one called crispy cheese bacon burger. Oh holy cow, that is one awesome explosion in your mouth. I think this is my all time favorite burger. I read many negative reviews about how long it takes to get your food. And I guess they listened and have improved . Our food came in a very respectable time. Also very good service and was seen to within minutes.  I give this place a two thumbs up. Oh and ask for extra napkins cause they are one juicy and messy hamburger.."}
{"input": "Really great food and people.  Super small casual atmosphere connected to a small grocery store.  Lunch time during the week is madness but they still keep the orders moving fast.  We tried almost everything on the menu And even had catering.  Highly recommended and come back frequently. \n\nTry the sopes if you've never had them before.  Tongue taco is really tasty too.  Tamales are soft and fresh.  The salsas are super spicy and really good ok everything.  \n\nWas allowed to try both red and green sauce on a burrito once.  The second time I asked she said no...guess it depends on who is taking ur order.  Still fantastic either way."}
{"input": "My boyfriend and his friends go every year for his birthday, and it's always a great place to stay with a large group even with kids. They've got everything from arcade, gym (with a room to do yoga/stretching etc!), pools, spa, club etc. \n\nI'm not much of a gambler but definitely enjoy the rest of the amenities. Rooms are definitely a tad older then others, and I would say food quality could improve and the crowd is interesting (I'll leave it at that). \n\nIt's definitely not vegas but you're also not paying vegas prices."}
{"input": "Excellent tasting Po-Boys but it could have had mire catfish, pretty skimpy.\nService, very good."}
{"input": "Frank is a great dentist and a very nice guy. He has a gentle manner, takes a sincere interest in his patients and in general is a top quality dentist and person. If you are in the market for a dentist he is an excellent choice. I've gone to him for years and know many others who have as well."}
{"input": "Haven't been getting out much since having hip surgery\n  Had a massage with Lisa and facial with Erin.  Will definitely be going back."}
{"input": "I thought I reviewed Luke last time I came back from Nola, but I see that I was remiss.  This is place is a solid win.  My fiance always gets the burger and it's huge, juicy self is complimented with perfectly cooked shoestring fries.  I loooove the crab and corn soup and wish I could have vats of it shipped to me during the cold NYC winters.  It's spicy, flavorful and full of fresh crab meat and plump kernels of corn straight off the ear.  The P&J oysters are a must, especially with that damn delicious crust.  I definitely scraped the remainders of it off the shells with my bread (that was warm and soft).  As for drinks, go with the Cypress in the summer--crazy refreshing and strong without tasting like straight liquor.  Great service and casual, upscale atmosphere."}
{"input": "Great atmosphere and good music. This place is a hidden gem in NOLA and is away from the hustle and bustle of NOLA streets. We had the cheese platter and lamb sliders which were so good that we had to order another plate of lamb sliders."}
{"input": "Here's another steakhouse I have not frequent for some time....I was dating someone, who lived out of town, for some apparent reason, we used to visit this restaurant around the X-Mas  holiday..Ruth Chris used to give out this large type bells you could hang around your neck..started collected them. Anyways...I was surprised at the size of this restaurant, very professional..starting with the hostess to the waiter..This is a \"pricey\" restaurant everything is \"A LA CARTE\"....each item you order is going to cost : appetizer / starch / vegetable / entree / dessert etc.  $$$$  *As a Footnote I didn't Pay !      Dessert : Tiramisu  (out of this world)"}
{"input": "Nice new place, definitely worth checking out.  Cozy, lounge-like atmosphere. It was my first time trying either Kava or Kratom teas, so I wasn't sure what to get, but Paul was great, and explained both very well."}
{"input": "Our nice little neighborhood park. Welcome to the nice part of west Philly aka Cedar park. With rich old school architecture that is maintained and the ability to walk around feeling safe. In the summer stick around to watch some fire twirlers and partake in the small music festival."}
{"input": "The hotel is beautiful and clean and the Carousel Bar is fun. My only complaint is that when we realized just how small a fill size bed is, there was no option for an additional cot. Seating was minimal in the room with one chair, but we didn't spend a lot of time in the room anyway, with so much to do close by. The doorman, Gerald, is a gem!"}
{"input": "This a really price store with great clothes. Mostly high end stuff, everything here is designer. \n\nThe workers here are really friendly and not pushy. They will leave you alone if you just want to be left alone, they are never breathing down your neck trying to make a sale. They carry casual clothing but I think it's much better place for suits and dress shirts and fancy clothing. I think this place stands out in West Edmonton Mall in terms of service and dressy clothing for men. They really do everything to make your shopping experience better. \n\nBe prepared to spend some coin here, although you won't be disappointed."}
{"input": "Nice rooms and shower pressure was great. Check in was fast and staff is friendly. Free breakfast. Hotel is right near the on / off ramp of the interstate. So its very easy to get to."}
{"input": "So my girlfriend is from Chicago, and I'd been searching forever to try and find her a place in Tampa that had Chicago style pizza. She's pretty picky about it of course, she's been used to the main 3 places up there that do it a little differently. Of course I was excited anyways because I'd never had Chicago style pizza before.\n\nAfter all the worriedness that she had, she was extremely happy with both the pizza and the awesome vintagey atmosphere. The waitress was very friendly as well. The self-serve beer cooler had a pretty good selection of craft beer, though I would have loved to see more of my favorites there. Also, the greek salad was easily one of the best I'd ever had in my entire life. It was pretty epic.\n\nOverall, we had an awesome experience, and will absolutely be going back again in the near future."}
{"input": "In and out in less than 15 minutes, $20 and it was already in the DMVs system. Made it easy and will come again."}
{"input": "All of this staff knows how to treat people!  Charlie at the front desk...amazing.  My housekeeper...amazing.  The gift shop girls...amazing.  Friendly, helpful, always looking for ways to go above and beyond.  The hallways look old and tired, but the rooms are nice, the beds comfy.  One star off for the stupid wifi issue others have mentioned."}
{"input": "So happy I found a bomb local sushi place!! Always ignored this shop going to domino's but I'm so glad I popped in. Will be coming here more than I should from now on. I got this sushiya roll and I was more than pleased! The salmon tasted fresh and the miso was on point. 10/10 recommend this spot."}
{"input": "One star for really nice service + no wait (came at an off hour), but this place was the worst meal I had in Nashville. The grits were a massive dissapointment - the cheese wasn't even melted into them, and the pancakes weren't bad, but also weren't better than Ihop...\n\nWe couldn't understand the hype and guessed that it maybe has to do with hungover college kids rolling in and appreciating greasy food?"}
{"input": "This is one fun Irish bar.\ntheres always a good crowd there, and a fun atmosphere\nmaybe it's the $5 PBR pitchers?\nwhatever it is there's always something going on here.\niv'e never seen so much Jager jugged in one place haha\ncheck this place out! your'e guaranteed to have a good time!!"}
{"input": "This place has some of the best food in Dutchtown! Their space is comfy and cozy, and I really need to get there more then I do.\n\nAttached to them they also have a local art gallery that is always full of amazing local art work!\n\nYou can also hire them to cater events for you. They made the food for a small birthday party I had, the food was so good is was gone before I really got to have some myself!\n\nAlso - they host a boardgame night once a month. I have never been able to make it, but I am gonna make it one of these days!"}
{"input": "It took forever to be seated and its small, cramped and hot inside. On the plus side you can drink while you wait.\nThe server was really cool and very honest when we asked what was good and fresh for the day.\nThe food was cooked fresh!  I mean from being alive in the tank to killed and cooked right behind you. \nWe ordered Lobster and rock crab both were amazing. We also had the lobster bisque which I thought needed more flavor.\n\nThe beer was ice cold and the food was hot and fresh. Service was outstanding once we actually got seated."}
{"input": "Great hotel!!! Don't go to Applebees, Fran at the Bistro in the hotel makes the best quesadillas and is super friendly!!"}
{"input": "The beer is good!! They have tables to sit. They have board games to play. It was fun to just sit and have a few drinks. My wife is pregnant and she can't drink(the only reason she beat me in trivia Pursuit). They have popcorn you can buy there(cheddar and cheddar and Carmel mix). You can earn rewards for visiting there. I paid with a card and everything was easy and receipt was sent to my phone. \n\nFood***You can order from cluster truck they deliver to the parking lot. 1st time ordering you get 10% off Cluster truck has a ton of food options. And the food is Fantastic. You order from an app and they accept Apple Pay too. The reason I focus on the food is because good beer is good beer, but having food too is rare. They also have a stage area for small concerts. I will go back!! Oh and the bathroom has to be one of the cleanest public bathrooms I've used.(just saying)"}
{"input": "Tried vanilla vanilla, chocolate chocolate and strawberry shortcake today, the chocolate and vanilla frosting are really good, strawberry shortcake is too sweet for me. As for the cake part, vanilla is excellent, loved it, but I could taste baking powder/soda in the chocolate cake, the last one was soaked in strawberry jam/sauce, and the cake became sticky. But the cakes are not dry as in others' review, I think they have improved the recipes. Vanilla vanilla is the best I got today, will try other flavors next time."}
{"input": "Right flavor but the mac & cheese was gooey and undercooked. I would not recommend this place as a visitor."}
{"input": "When this place first popped up on my phone as hot and new, I was so excited to try this place! It's always so exciting to try new cafes and ice cream places that pop in Reno since there really isn't many trendy places like these. It was interesting to see the cute wired sign and pink wall. The man at the register said him and his fiancé started this business so I wish them both luck! He was very welcoming very informative. The soft serve is so creamy-- the way it should be. The flavors are so yummy, it was nice to see familiar flavors like Ube and green tea. For some suggestions maybe a Thai tea or strawberry flavor? It was nice that we were offered pocky sticks to add to our krem creation. Maybe next time if adding wafer sticks or some type of cookies would be nice. I got the ube baby baby and it was delicious! I'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"input": "Great place to watch footy.  I was visiting town for work and needed a place to watch my blues take on barfalona and came across Chatham.  It was a Tuesday so they had $4 Guiness and Black and Tans. Had their fish and chips which was new experience for me. Never had fish that was so soft after being fried, but I really enjoyed it, almost the texture of a donut. Saw my team win and had a great time at this pub."}
{"input": "Great place for a drink, nice friendly staff.  Didn't eat there though and would be hesitant to as it doesn't look to be the cleanest place."}
{"input": "This place is game changer for the neighborhood. We got some take out tonight and the food was absolutely  delicious.  I'm really stoked they moved in and I'm newly smitted by southern Latin food.  The family who owns it also seem very sweet! \nI think this place is exactly  what the neighborhood needed!"}
{"input": "Hello again yelpers!\n\nI gotta say, this is a pretty solid mexican restaurant. Their food is usually great-tasting and nice and hot and the service is not too bad but could always be better. This review is gonna be a pretty short one though. Whenever I want good mexican food that's nearby then this is the place I'd go, unless, of course, I'm going to another area altogether. I could go ahead and compare this place to other mexican joints, but I think that's kinda like derailing my own review.\n\nI'd certainly recommend this place to anyone in the Rivergate/Madison area."}
{"input": "We went for lunch on Saturday.  They only serve from a brunch menu.  It was very disappointing.  They really need to re-think the brunch menu and serve items from their good at.  I never had dinner her although I would assume it is better than the brunch items.  I had the meatball omelette which was just ok.  I would say anywhere else would have better omelets. My husband had the burger with an egg on it.  He thought it was good but there are better burgers out there.  I should have went with my gut instinct after seeing the brunch menu but decided to stay since it was Joe Madden's restaurant.  I say skip this place and go down the street to Goody Goody."}
{"input": "Small, crowded and hectic but boy the food was good and plentiful. Wait staff was right on top of the chaos. Great breakfast place."}
{"input": "As a fan of the late night kabab, shwarma or gyro in nyc, I made a stop through Ali ba ba's on one occasion and ended up here again near the end of the trip as it hits the spot!  They are bigger in size of the ones I get in NYC and double the price ($6) but I can imagine the cost is a factor of limited demand (small lines) and pallets in NOLA for a gyro vs a po boy.  They only have rooster sauce for hot sauce which is a knock and they can be slow to serve but the gyros are better than the $5 slice next door or the $5+ lucky dogs on the corner."}
{"input": "This place puts \"hole\" in hole in the wall!\nIt's an excellent size for it induces you to get to know the people around you!  I've met many a great and fascinating people here over the years!\n\nWho can beat their \"shot:30\"??  A different flavor every week!\nThe bartenders are awesome, beautiful, and snarky.  (I have a favorite bartender who shall remain nameless to avoid \"favorites\" but they are all great!  Sorry, I like you all, but she's my fav!)  A different happy hour each night which makes the week that much more exciting!\n(You can smoke here so be warned and don't get pissy when somoene lights up next to you)\n\nPlus, their prices are conducive to repeat business!  I can drink all night AND still have money left over for a 2am taco! \n\nSo I suggest you add this place to your local week visitation schedule!"}
{"input": "I absolutely love Khyber! Low-key atmosphere, reasonable prices, and fabulous food. Their pulled pork sandwich is amazing. They also make a mean cocktail. Would absolutely recommend it, and can't wait to go back!"}
{"input": "This salon is under new ownership!  I was so disappointed when the previous owners left, however the new owners still provide the excellent service I had previously.  They are just as good; services are not rushed, they do a great job; very attentive and I had a foot reflexology with my pedicure.y and my feet feel so good.\nThe massage at the end was awesome to!\nI'll definitely go back!"}
{"input": "Thought we would try this place out for a quick bite with the kids. The food was terrible, even the kids burger which was about half the size of the bun (didn't think you could mess up a kid burger). I had the crab cake pasta which was bland and full of crab shells. My husband had the white beans which were not yo momma's for sure."}
{"input": "This place is decent for some quick fresh tacos. I tried the sauteed shrimp tacos, and they were okay. They needed to be seasoned but otherwise it was good. Overall I would visit this store again"}
{"input": "One of the best shopping experiences one can imagine.\nA perfect jewel of a shop.\nIt has the most carefully selected eye glass frames from all over the world.\nThe service is second to none.\nIf only all shops could be like this.\n\nI read all the other reviews here. Apart from 2 all are 5*, clearly all these customers actually bought something, while the 2 negative ones...draw your own conclusions."}
{"input": "The donut Paninis are outstanding. The Kolaches are delicious. There isn't a thing on the menu I didn't want to try. My heart is so lucky we do not live in the neighborhood."}
{"input": "Decided to try this place since it's close to my house...it was a good gamble.  Fish was fresh and the chefs were really attentive to us.  We were in there before a dinner \"rush\" so I can't speak to what it would be like if it was super busy, but we were pleased and would definitely go back."}
{"input": "Best Thai food South of Bay to Bay. Everything I've had there is great; no overuse of oil or fish sauce either, like some other nearby places. Only done takeout, but it's always ready within 20 minutes."}
{"input": "Best breakfast in West!!!! The chicken & waffles never disappoint and neither does the service. I only wish they were open  at 2am so I can get pancakes after dancing at Dahlak."}
{"input": "I don't know why i had such high expectations of this farmers market, but I did.  I guess I thought it would be similar to those I find at the beach cities of San Diego.\n\nI was a little shocked at how small it was.  It is one of the bigger farmers markets that I have been to, but I guess I still had those expectations.\n\nThe location is really nice because you can also stop by state street for an additional outing.  However, I wasn't a fan of the group of homeless people and beggars that you have to walk through to enter the market.\n\nIn terms of the vendors, they have the typical fruits and veggies, eggs, meat, flowers, etc.  I was a fan of this pie that I was given a sample of on my way out of the market."}
{"input": "I haven't been here for at least three years and it's due to the service. Everytime I went to this store, just to look mostly, the staff were stuck up and one girl was even telling me how to hold a book so I don't break the binding. She even told me I have to pay for it if I hold it wrong. It was so odd that I just left and never went back. When I was in highschool, in the late 90's, this store was great but being grown up now I expect better service. Maybe they've changed but after over 10 visits of the same crummy service I'm not sure I want to find out."}
{"input": "Suzie is great! Professional, efficient, personable. Everything you'd want in an aesthetician. I've been going to her for years and I will for years to come."}
{"input": "Pretty good and clean Walmart. Lines are long as usual bit we used the self check out for speedier service. Lol :-)"}
{"input": "Mr B's BBQ shrimp is of my favorite things to eat in NOLA. For those of you uneducated in this dish, it has nothing to do with BBQ. Weird, right? The large head-on shrimp are simmered in a rich sauce of butter, Worcestershire sauce and Creole seasoning and served with French bread. The flavor in this dish is beyond incredible, and after the shrimp are all eaten I'm sopping up every last bit of sauce with the bread.\n \nFor the rest of the review, visit: http://dashofles.com/blog/new-orleans-birthday-weekend/"}
{"input": "We decided to try walking in on a Saturday afternoon, for pedicures, and we got right in!  Clean facilities, good color choices, and great massage chairs in the pedicure area.  There were plenty of technicians, and they were friendly and courteous.  And they did a really good job on our pedicures, for a decent price.  Will definitely be back."}
{"input": "All of the previous reviews are fairly spot-on. This is a little hole-in-the-wall place. It has a definite Mom and Pop feel. The decor is ok.\nI had the Potato Skins as an appetizer. Wow, that was a huge order! They could have been heated a little more, but I can't complain otherwise.\nFor my entree, I went with my personal benchmark, Chicken Fried Steak. The portion was huge, and I'm pretty sure it was hand-breaded, and likely in their fried chicken breeding. This is a GOOD thing. In addition, it came with two sides. Green beans were delicious and bacony, and the 4-cheese Mac and Cheese was good...and a little kick of heat!\nOverall, this isn't fine dining by any stretch. But it's good basic homestyle.\nI will return...if I ever stop feeling so stuffed!!"}
{"input": "My wife and I went here for our anniversary and had such a great experience from the moment we arrived.  We were seated next to the huge fish tank, which is like getting a front row seat at a concert. \nFor an appetizer, we started with the seared scallops, which were delicious. For dinner, my wife ordered the mahi and I had the grouper piccata. Both were great.  After dinner, we almost made a big mistake because we weren't sure if we were going to have dessert. Thankfully, our server, Jen Fig, told us that there was a new pastry chef who makes all the desserts in-house. Jen raved about the chef's newest creation, a lemon meringue cheesecake which I don't even think is on the menu yet. We had to try it and it seriously turned out to be one of the best desserts I've ever had. It was such a great way to end our evening. Thank you Jen!  I look forward to returning soon."}
{"input": "Watermelon pickles were amazing and the wedge was done well with great ranch dressing and juicy plump partly sun dried tomatoes"}
{"input": "Stopped in to check out this new spot around the corner from us, as my boyfriend has been anticipating its opening for quite some time. Can I say it- FINALLY! Am amazing place for sushi in the city. We were there for what they were calling their soft opening, where apparently they are testing out menu and cocktail items for their \"official\" opening sometime soon. We were very pleased with the ambiance, service and food/drink. The fish is top quality. We said hello to the owner/executive chef and he seemed to be beaming over his accomplishments, rightfully so! This is a must stop if you're a sushi/Asian fusion fan. We look forward to seeing what's in store for Tuna Bar and are thrilled to have this a two minute walk away!"}
{"input": "Sublime! Came here on a recommendation from a NOLA native friend and was not disappointed. Everything we ordered was incredible and our server Gary was excellent. Great cocktails, amazing appetizers (tuna tartare, hamachi curry, marinated shrimp \n\nI strongly recommend this restaurant, definitely will go back next time I visit New Orleans."}
{"input": "An excellent experience. Clean and stylish rooms, comfortable beds and a stunning city view."}
{"input": "I'm a vegetarian who loves fried foods. This is the perfect spot for me!"}
{"input": "In addition to my previous review, my husband reminded me that the waiter leaned over him multiple times, dropping sweat onto my husband and the items in front of him on the table. GROSS!"}
{"input": "Honestly, didn't live up to the hype. Food was definitely good but was not BBQ that blew me out of the water. And the corn bread was SOO DRY. Disappointing. Hoping it was just a bad night but seeing as I was visiting Nashville for the first time, I probably won't be going back when I visit again."}
{"input": "The coffee ice cream is a must-try. The flavor is great, not too sweet, not too rich. It is just right."}
{"input": "Best pizza in town! fresh ingredients. a little on the pricey side but well worth it.  delivery and pickup only.  the white pizza and thai chicken are my favorite."}
{"input": "Known for their enormous salads and toasted sandwiches, my favorite is the California style pizzas.   I tend to always go back to the Deborah Pizza.  It's a pesto style with roasted onions and chicken. \nI have them leave off the tomatoes because it makes it too watery.   The indulgent every so often choice is the Pimento Cheese pizza.  This is greasy, so blot the pie with a few napkins and double up on the Lipotor and enjoy.   I became a member of their Roundtable elite which is a email list that sends you specials and new menu items.   On a stalker note, there are loads of \"Nashville\" cast stars eating there all the time."}
{"input": "Tried Cafe Deluxe for the first time with a friend. All the food on the menu looks delicious. I had the deluxe salad with a scoop of egg salad on top, yum yum. Their prices are great, love the veggie options, and large portions! I will be going back.."}
{"input": "One of the best places on Washington Avenue to sit outside and relax.  A very relaxing atmosphere both inside and out, with service to match.  We enjoyed both outside for people watching and inside for the fireplace and black and white movies on the televisions.   One of the best features of Blondie's is that while the rest of the block is loud and raucous, Blondie's is a nice oasis away from all of this. \n\nFood and drink:\nBlondie's offers an above average list of wines by the glass, and some very nice beer selections.  I enjoyed several red wines, a cava, and a few glasses of beer over several recent visits.  They also offer a limited menu of smaller plates, charcuterie and the likes, from which I have not ordered.  Given their offerings, I'm sure these are quite nice.  Also a very nice feature is their $4 wine nights on Wednesdays, which is always a plus.\n\nWe will definitely be back in the future..."}
{"input": "AWESOME thai place. Went for lunch and the service was snappy and friendly and everything we ordered was fresh and incredibly flavorful. Really comfy/cool ambiance and you can sort of watch them cooking the food in the big woks. Definitely going to frequent this place. A bonus: they sell cute t-shirts with elephants on them."}
{"input": "Slllooowweeessttt deli counter ever! Been waiting for over 20 minutes for the Daily Special of all things. I could have caught the fish myself in this amount of time."}
{"input": "Great prices and portions.  It is what you would expect if a traditional American diner.  Decent breakfast burrito and good size kids meals for $4.99.   The coffee was good too.  \n\nThis place was pretty busy and the service was quick.  It was a little bit o a wait to get in but we expected that with a party of 8.  \n\nWill definitely go back if in the neighborhood.  The Yelp cash back is nice too!"}
{"input": "Everyone with bad reviews needs to know this place is a bistro. Service was great, friendly, and entertaining. We enjoyed the bacon sampler, which was amazing. had the bacon cappuccino which was different but good! Recommend this to my fello baconeers!"}
{"input": "It may be a bit pricey, but it's good food in the cafe and a good selection in the grocery. I love their vegan sandwich and tofu melt and they always have a great selection of vegan sweets."}
{"input": "Awesome food...everything was fresh and made to order the owner Chris is super helpful and his wife Henna are super nice and made my experience there super Awesome!  Kimchi was fresh and the food was super delicious.  I will be back!!!"}
{"input": "My review of 12/17/14 remains valid and true to fact.  Since my review in 2014, we have eaten breakfast here multiple times and it never fails to impress whether it be the breakfast itself or the delicious pastries.  A hidden gem!!"}
{"input": "Went to this store for an alignment,  when I parked the mechanics were just sitting with no work to do. At 8:30 this is not a good sing for the shop. They checked my vehicle and then notified me at I needed approx $1500.00 in repairs. They even said things that were just replaced needed to be replaced. Drove to my normal mechanic and only needed 2 parts for about 1/6 of the price. \nWould not go to this place again."}
{"input": "Perfect if you know what you want and just drive through. A little cluttered feeling if you decide to park in front and walk around looking for something new/different. The guys that work there are always nice and friendly. \n\nGets 4 stars in my book for being a rare commodity in this part of the U.S., having competitive pricing (not necessarily the cheapest in the area), a decent selection, and a cool staff."}
{"input": "Best place for salads! I go there every time I'm in town for lunch. It's fast and veggies are always fresh."}
{"input": "I really am not sure how Subway maintains restaurants in the Philadelphia area when there are so many good hoagie places out there.  Everyone knows what a Subway sandwich tastes like -- meh."}

{"input": "My days as the dutchess of the beagle are numbered. I went this past week, and was extremely excited to do so bc I hadn't been for a month or so... Only to find out it's no longer a gay bar?!?!? That's what norristown needs! Another straight sports bar! If the new straight owners wanted to 'try' to keep it up as a gay bar, they should have promoted it as such, with various events like there had been in the past. But why would straight men want it to be a gay bar anyway? They don't... So not only did I find out the unfortunate news that my very regular local gay bar had been taken from me... But it was also empty... With nothing fun or exciting going on! AND! Whatever genius new chef they had in the kitchen tried to serve someone at the bar shrimp cocktail with RAW, GREY SHRIMP!!!! This is also after they had to send someone out to get tortilla chips bc they had NONE to fill their initial order of nachos.\nTo say I'm disappointed would be an understatement.\nGOOD. LUCK."}
{"input": "Went here with my friends and I had a horrible experience. I asked for a hookah menu and apparently it does not exist. The owner was very rude and unwelcoming. You have to pay $25 per 2 people and they only accept cash-_- I had a horrible experience!!!! If you want to hookah with friends, do not go to cleopatra cafe."}
{"input": "Very nice atmosphere.  Valet  parking. A little pricey for meals,  but there is a sunset menu 4:30 to 5:30 I believe.  We started  with a drink at the bar.  We were not told it was happy hour,  I was charged $4 more for a drink at the bar than at the table?  I should have questioned but didn't.  A glass of wine was $2 less at the bar?  We started  with 6 oysters 6 shrimp cocktail . Best oysters  ever!  Mixed grilled seafood with vegetables  ny strip mashed salad 1 dessert  it was my birthday  and they suprised  me with creme brulee! 1    drink each.  $125. Waitress  was very attentive."}
{"input": "This is my favorite pizza place in Tucson! Great food! Great service! Relaxing atmosphere! And did I mention the super stix! You haven't lived until you've tried the super stix!"}
{"input": "Adorable little shop. The food/snacks were great and the portions generous but of course the alcohol is the star. While I wasn't too big on the meads, the ciders were wonderful and I ended up enamored enough to bring one all the way back home to the east coast."}
{"input": "Great little sushi spot, a little out of the way for most but worth the drive if you are looking for a new sushi bar. The mussel appetizer is amazing, and the charred salmon is delicious."}
{"input": "Over price and pretentious hipster food . 4 bite of nothing on my small tasteless snapper.  The carnitas my daughter got where tasteless."}
{"input": "The food was pretty good. I had the general tso's chicken, medium spice level; fried rice; and spring roll. The spring roll was delicious. Delivery took long."}
{"input": "Wasn't impressed by the crazy long lines and only 1 person working, took absolutely forever and was definitely not worth it. The food was terrible and so was the coffee. Definitely wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"input": "A great neighborhood coffee house.  (The hood in question is Dogtown.)  The java is good and draws a wide demographic from college kids to seniors to moms.  Not the pretty people scene that Kaldi's can be sometimes.  Very laid back and inviting.  Good food too."}
{"input": "We had a very nice dinner here on St. Patrick's day, which happens to be my sister's birthday.  The server was super sweet and served the cake we brought to celebrate.  The bartender was so kind and gave my sister a complimentary St. Patty's cocktail, which was incredibly yummy.  \n\nWe ordered various dishes:  tri-tip, rotisserie chicken, pulled pork and a veggie burrito.  All was wonderful, except for the veggie burrito, which was lackluster (but who orders a veggie burrito at a rotisserie grill???).  My father-in-law has visited many more times, raving about the moist, flavorful rotisserie chicken.  \n\nThe prices were reasonable, portions adequate and service super!  We will definitely visit again, minus the resident vegetarian.  :)"}
{"input": "I've had nothing but great experiences at Plate. I've had the Burger and Fries about a dozen times, the Filet Mignon, and a number of the other entrees and have always loved the meals. The service has always been terrific and timely. What more can I say! I look forward to enjoying many more Plate dining experiences!"}
{"input": "I had buyers remorse buying from them as soon as I was ready to drive off the lot.  The car was considered Honda Certified.  It was a 2013. That basically meant they had thoroughly inspected the car.  When I test drove the car I did not notice the small crack in the window and scratches on the passenger side.  Their inspection said no cracks, chips etc.  That was my first clue I had made a mistake.  After I arrived home I looked at the financing.  I was charged a fee to get a better interest rate. The finance person also convinced me to get a protection package I had already told the sales person I did not want.  He had already put the package into the price on the paperwork.  The car had a Sonic price of 16900.  I put 6 thousand down and still owed over 16,000 on the car at 5 % interest for 72 months.  I could have bought a new car for that price.  Beware once you go to the finance department, they will try to get you!  Go to CARMAX, you have 5 days to return the car!!!!"}
{"input": "This place is just the greatest.\n\nFirst, the correct current address is 33 S. 43rd Street, between Chestnut and Walnut. Don't go to the old address like I did!\n\nThis place is basically a hole in the wall but they have EVERYTHING, and at great prices. Every time I have called for something they have it. I bought an external hard drive dock that has input for laptop AND desktop, both SATA *AND* IDE, for sixty dollars. It works like a charm.\n\nToday I'm going in for an external CD burner with lightscribe capability, for $40!\n\nPlease don't get impatient if there is a language barrier. There seems to be an older Asian man, and a younger one, and the older man may have some communication issues, but you can tell he is trying and if you are patient with him he will be patient with you!!!!!\n\nI can't recommend this place enough when it comes to your computer item needs."}
{"input": "Been eating here since the beginning. Best Sonoran dog in town hands down. The comp is overrated and his buns and ingredients aren't as fresh. Their carne is also good and i also mess w a caramelo from time to time. There is a reason rachel ray said they the second best hot dogs in the U.S."}
{"input": "Had #42. Very good. I like being able to add all the sauces to tweak the flavour and add heat. \n\nWe also had spring rolls and salad rolls. Both yum. \n\nFast service even though restaurant was full. \n\nWould come again."}
{"input": "I tried the Diablo omelette I like spicy and it was delicious staff was friendly good Corner Cafe"}
{"input": "Beautiful modern place, they have a nice view, the only thing is that is close to the train and you may hear it if you are on that side of the building, other than that it's great and has a yolk on the corner!"}
{"input": "AWFUL. I have been there more than once, and it was never great but ok. However the most recent time we went was the WORST EXPERIENCE I have ever had at a restaurant. We were sat and no one ever came to our table, I had to go get them, she got us the wrong appetizer, the food was awful and cold, everything took forever even though the restaurant was empty!!! The waitress was just terrible, I had to go find her several times. We almost got up and left and I wish we had! At the end of it our check was wrong and I never complain but when I did finally talk to the manager she didn't even care and did nothing about it. She didn't apologize or offer any kind of restitution. On our way out I did see that waitress was eating at a table, that would explain why she never came to ours!"}
{"input": "Well rounded company with an amazing owner - Danny. In terms of start to finish IT solutions Voree is the best there is.  Danny has a very very high expectation for his employees and their performance.  Top notch everything. Reasonably priced for quality service."}
{"input": "I'm not one to watch the chef shows so celebrity chefs don't do me. That said, the food was creative and cutting edge. We had the  four course tasting menu. The dishes have many flavors that reveal themselves to you one at a time which is fun. Small portions, but enough food. I had a wonderful glass of Argentinian wine which was fun. My only disappointment is that they only change the four course menu seasonally so no real incentive to go back again until next season unless I ante up for the six course menu which is just a little too pricey with a kid in college.  Wonderful service. Really top notch which is becoming more and more rare these days."}
{"input": "Some of the finest Mexican food I've had. The fried fish taco is WONDERFUL, as is all of the other food. My biggest regret is not buying their red sauce and birria to take home. \n\nAlso-there is no air conditioning. They do have ceiling fans, but we all know those aren't necessarily helpful in the monsoon season. The food is definitely worth the trip though!"}
{"input": "The park is nothing to write home about, but the view of the city and ocean are incredible. The parking is limited so be patient."}
{"input": "Walking to a neighboring restaurant for lunch, we passed by a sign:\n\n\"Nashville's #1 Rated Burger\"\n\nI've gone to a lot of places specifically for things like 'the best burger in town', or '#1 rated burger', and it doesn't take a lot of convincing. So, there I sat a few days later, awaiting this highly sought after ground beef wonder. The service was really good and very friendly, and the overall atmosphere is pretty good, though unmemorable.\n\nThen came the burger.\n\nIt was pretty tasty, though I'm pretty sure their secret is salt. I've definitely had better, in Nashville and elsewhere, but this one had it's own charm (read: salt). I don't always like a ton of salt, but when I do, I'd go to National Underground for a cheeseburger."}
{"input": "Workers are nice and it is very clean kids clothes are very cute and they are for a reasonable price"}
{"input": "Many places in Philly claim to have the best cheesesteaks in town but this place really does! An there's a bonus to that as well...They have a special everyday of 3 Cheesesteaks for $13. An trust me you will not regret eating there. If cheesesteaks aren't your thing the pizza and pasta are equally wondeful.\n\nYou an your pals can get a good mow on for dirt cheap.\n\nTrust me."}
{"input": "I'm loving this whole fresh local food trend. It makes me feel so healthy (even though it may not be). \n\nSo the last time I was there, I ordered the Spicy Avocado and Lime kale and grain bowl. It was delicious!! It was so filling that I was able to share it with someone else. The fiancee ordered the buffalo chicken burger and wasn't all that impressed. He said it was kind of boring. So I guess it's a hit or miss depending on what you order.\n\nMy only complaint would be some of the employees - having to deal with unpleasant people kind of ruins your dining experience just a bit."}
{"input": "Not sure the significance behind the name and logo of the restaurant.  Unless it was three guys putting their money together to form this business \nThe food was great/ staff friendly/ huge menu from breakfast /lunch/dinner to dessert.   Open 24 hours will definitely be back next time in town"}
{"input": "Back a year later for more birthday ice cream martinis!! I forgot our servers name :( but he was excellent and made the night so fun. The Tuscan bean soup was delicious and the martinis were spot on. Got the chocolate framboise and then they whipped me up a cake flavored one on request. Completed the night with a tiny glass of ice cream with a candle. I think this will be an annual tradition. :)"}
{"input": "This is basically a neighborhood corner bar in Port Richmond. Parking is a bit of a problem. Service is always good. If you are looking for good beers this isn't the place (Bud, Coors, etc.). It's a local shot and a beer type of place. I have never tried anything on the food front so I cannot comment on their kitchen. They usually have local cover bands on the weekends with no cover. Family and friends have played here and I've had fun for what the place is."}
{"input": "Love the food at El Tumi, but it is truly family run and the service is informal.  But the food makes this a gem- unique flavors and tastes from a country most of us have not visited.  Start with the great green salsa and chips.  The palta rellena salad with avocados stuffed with vegies is awesome.  Entree are really good also.  My fav beef is lomo al jugo, beef with sauteed onions and tomatoes.  Aji de Gallina, chicken in a cream sauce with Peruvian yellow spice is a good choice also.  Both of the Peruvian drinks chicha morada and cebada are different but a good accompaniment for the food.  Prices are extremely reasonable. Altogether, the kind of restaurant that makes a city a great place to live. I'll be working my way through the menu enjoying the experience."}
{"input": "Everything about this place is great. Located in Historic Reading Terminal, quick service, flavorful dishes... :)\n\nI don't know anywhere else in Philly that you can get amazing, authentic New Orleans food.\n\nI seriously salivate thinking about how amazing the bread pudding with the whiskey butter sauce is... MMMMMMmmmmmmm !!!!!\n\nThe jambalaya, cajun chicken alfredo, and gumbo are also so yum. \n\nThe owner (I hear also a professional caterer on the side) loves New Orleans food. \n\nGo here when you go to Reading Terminal, trust me."}
{"input": "Got there mid-morning today, the early rush was over. Two tables were full, each with three people. The family in one of the tables had just walked in ahead of me, so they were being attended to first. Still, I was immediately welcomed, and in a couple of minutes a friendly lady brought the breakfast menu and asked if I wanted coffee. A cup appeared a few moments later, and was kept full throughout my visit. Radio playing golden oldies from the 70s, my kind of music. The ham omelet with home fries and toast arrive a few minutes later, worth waiting for. Done just right and kept me filled for hours. A friendly family restaurant where you feel welcome and appreciated, just north of Gulfport."}
{"input": "Plain, bland, not good sushi restaurant.  3-4 younger Chinese boys were the sushi chefs.  None of the staff was friendly or concerned about my experience.  \n\nI had a dragon roll which was mushy, a spider roll which wasn't soft shell crab, and a spicy tuna roll that had a bunch of sesame seeds rolled into the rice.  \n\nNormally at a sushi restaurant I would order nigiri only but the fish in the hoshizaki refrigerator at the sushi bar looked unappetizing and not properly stored.\n\nWill not come here again. Stay away."}
{"input": "My first time to La Fusion, on my way to the mall, decided to grab a bite first. Great food, great service, very beautiful restaurant setup, very clean. This restaurant has the atmosphere that is a relaxing place to catch up with friends and enjoy a great meal. \n\n I'm very picky about where I go, I love good food, good service, and cleanliness... I gave La Fusion a five star rating because I feel that this restaurant deserves it. I would definitely return with friends."}
{"input": "My go to place in IN when visiting family!  David does the most amazing pink and whites!  The shop is clean and the staff are professional and courteous.  The new management is outstanding (well three years ago but new to me)."}
{"input": "Family, friends, and everyone you are happy to meet. All under one roof. I have some feels for this place and they all come from the caring hearts of this establishments owners. Amazingly the staff all remember me by name each time I stop by. I usually stick to the salmon dinners and wings. But when I do indulge? Its the angel hair alfredo with sauteed chicken. I have dreams about food when I diet heavy. And this is one of my normal courses in la la land. My favorite place for all that it is and will be. Thanks to Robert and Henry and their lovely family and staff for always making me feel important. Not to be confused with impotent."}
{"input": "URINE!!! This place smells like urine. Would never come back here, very old style theater and super old carpets and seats. Even the screen size is small. \n\nI wish there was a way to give negative rating on yelp! Expensive for nothing but urine smell"}
{"input": "Hotel was very accommodating! Staff was very sweet and helpful! Alisa made our stay that much more stress free and a great experience!"}
{"input": "Cute little date spot tucked away down town Edmonton.Good service and good food.Was very happy with the Venison tenderloin and blue cheese gnocchi.Plating was very nice and the cook on the Venison was very good.My wife loved the lobster tail as well!"}
{"input": "Unique items, worth a stop in.  Their silver jewelry is reasonably priced, and they have lots of silver chains in assorted sizes and styles."}
{"input": "Good sushi, slow service and moderately expensive. They did bring us free edamame because of our wait and couldn't have been nicer. We had 3 rolls, 2 hot sake, 3 beers for $60. The big Sapporo was $10. The edamame was awesome, the philly roll was awesome as is the standard, the spicy tuna was good and the dragon roll wasn't for me, I didn't enjoy it. For two people I felt the meal was worth about $40-$45 not the $60 we paid. I will probably try somewhere else the next time I get a hankering for sushi. The decor is plain and simple, a few large tables, people sit together, it wasn't too crowded. Nice people, good food, a bit overpriced. I wouldn't not recommend it but it's not the greatest. I'd give it 2.5 stars if I could but I'll err on the nice side"}
{"input": "My favorite place to get a hot chai in town! They offer a selection of non-dairy alternatives, including my favorite, almond milk. They also offer 3 different types of chai - all brewed tea and not that sugary Starbucks stuff. If you go in the morning they have a wide variety of croissants, quiche, cinnamon rolls and other yummy stuff."}
{"input": "Cinco de mayo means margaritas and sangria and all things fried... this great place does a nice job with combining flavors of several different ethnicities and backgrounds and develops recipes that are unique.  Although not touted as a \"Mexican\" destination they know how to rock the rock salt and pour that tequila.  They also just opened a wine bar a couple doors down for overflow and specialty bottles.  A high five for the on the rocks margaritas and house made white or red sangria - definitely worth the trip!"}
{"input": "Saw all the negative reviews and was a bit worried.  Place is still fairly new and working through some growing pains.  Staff is still learning and I think they are cycling through a bunch of kids in training.  \n\nPizza was ok but kind of high priced for what I got.   They had a slice and beer special so I didn't have to get a whole pie.  I had a slice of meat lovers and pepperoni.  I think their sauce overpowers the taste of the toppings and cheese - could barely taste the pepperoni.  Light sauce would be my recommendation to others.\n\nWait on food is definitely an issue here and I don't think he servers do a very good job of preparing the customers.  Brought up concerns to manager but he didn't seem too worried.  \n\nI need a local option for Chicago style pizza but not sure yet this place will be it."}
{"input": "Great place to go for large gatherings/groups! Family-style eating is best here and even though the taste isn't as authentic as Chili Szechuan on 42nd and Chestnut, that doesn't mean this place isn't wonderful. This place is great for those who love spicy food. I love the Dan dan noodles here! So addicting and the dry pot chicken is awesome. Another recommendation is cumin style chicken, bokchoy with black mushrooms, and scallion style (not spicy)!"}
{"input": "I love this place. Love the Dan Dan noodles, the scallion pancake, the three cup chicken, and all the dumplings. It's delicious, the service is good, and the food is not as agonisingly spicy as some reviews say. It reminds me of all the old Szechuan places on Spadina in Toronto, except marginally better and more upscale. Good, interesting cocktails too."}
{"input": "Phenomenal brunch experience. The poached eggs on buttermilk biscuits and pork confit was delightful and just the right size. The service was impeccable-- friendly and watchful. My orange juice and water were regularly filled! They had live jazz during weekend brunch, and the restaurant is beautiful and cozy.\n\nWhile the menu is small and can be uncreative, the food is high quality and decently priced for Rittenhouse Square ($12 for the above mentioned plate and $3 for OJ). \n\nAll in all, a good experience."}
{"input": "I really wanted to give this a higher rating. I've heard great things about their cocktails and small plates. My friend and I each ordered two different cocktails. I was underwhelmed by all of them; Time Enough For Love was the best of the four we ordered between the two of us, if you like sweet cocktails. I was craving a spicy cocktail and was not a fan of Unholy Night.\nThe small plates were unique. We ordered four different plates to share. We were apprehensive about the scallion pancake, but it ended up being my favorite. We also tried the poblano dumpling, the truffle beet salad, and the house made burrata cheese. They were all average. I was disappointed there were no meat options that didn't include pork (even the meatballs have them). \nLove the location and the decor, but doubt I will hurry back."}
{"input": "I like this place. All of the food taste good and is reasonably priced. It's a step up in food quality from usual chains like Cheesecake Factory and such. The menu is very large with some creative items. I've never had anything bad there, but I've also never had anything great. Everything is consistently good, which is fine with me. The atmosphere is excellent as is the bread. I dislike that they don't have reservations and the service has been hit or miss in my experience."}
{"input": "This place has awesome salsa.  Too bad it is such a small cup for four diners.  They serve the same size to a party of one or two.  There are no free refills...hmmm!\nThe Huevos Rancheros was delicious.  The egg was cooked to perfection and the veggies, rice and guac were excellent.  The Sante Fe Burrito is truly HUGE - also delicious- great salsa verde!  The Grilled Skirt Steak was tender and properly marinated. Check out the Enchilada Oaxaca it was a real winner.\nWhen visiting family in this area again, we will return."}
{"input": "I love this hotel. We always stay here anytime we come to town, the free night stay offers don't hurt either, but after staying at several other hotels/casinos in the area, I will only stay at the peppermill. The rooms are always clean and I love the Tuscany tower suites."}
{"input": "My lunch included a small portion of jerk chicken, collard greens, and apparently cabbage.  I wanted Mac and cheese!  Cabbage sounds nothing like Mac-n-cheese!  Anyway, after my initial shock and disappointment when I opened the container, I started digging into the chicken.  Portions are very big, and the chicken fell off the bone and was juicy.  I love Jamaican food and get the cuisine in any city I visit, so I was a bit disappointed by their chicken.  It wasn't bad, just not very flavorful or memorable.  Collard greens and cabbage (ugh) were the same story.  For $8 plus tip, I was expecting something much more, especially after all the great reviews. I did notice the customers ahead of me ordered chicken wings, so maybe I'll try that the next time.  \n\nI can't imagine a worst place to be then in a food truck during a heat wave, so I will say that the service was very friendly by the lady."}
{"input": "Always hot & i'm always left satisfied. The hot wings are addictive! The ghetto punch is amazing!"}
{"input": "We have rented from Milpas Rental for over 12 years to include major rentals for our vacation home remodel. I rented a carpet cleaner from them today as I could not get a carpeting cleaning company to come out on short notice. Upon using the carpet cleaner I run into a glitch. When returning the item I explained the situation and they were most accommodating.\nThanks again!"}
{"input": "I had high hopes for this place since the parking lot was full. I ordered fish and chips, and got peas and macaroni and cheese on the side. My companion ordered the knackwurst and saurerkraut with mashed potatoes on the side. The main courses were all right. The macaroni and cheese was inedible for me. The flavoring tasted very artificial. My companion's mashed potatoes tasted like paper. We have eaten at enough establishments like this to know we can get better quality food for more affordable prices. We will not be returning."}
{"input": "Ordered a pizza for the first time. Love the crust, just the right size and very yummy! They make their own gluten free crust, my daughter says it's among the best. The only thing is they don't have dairy-free cheese available but the Pizza Chef said we can bring our own and they will put it on for us. I imagine it will be extra good melted in the wood burning oven. The place smells awesome would love to go there just to smell the mix of aromas...wood and baking pizza!"}
{"input": "For food truck food this place is hit or miss.  They end up outside Ms. Mae's a lot.  Have had the pig sandwich, the bacon barbecue burger and the crawfish mac and cheese.  Some is more delicious than others but a good options for the late night crowd."}
{"input": "I have used \"vrbo\" and home away websites for a longtime. This is the worst experience I have ever had with a site. My friends and I were trying to book a place for the Essence Festival in July. We knew how the housing would be an issue so we started looking for a place to stay at the end of Feb. We saw the French Quarter Suites offered Town homes, they looked nice, so we began to inquire. The process is usually pretty easy but working with Ms. Leslie was not. When asking questions about a 5br town home she would often skirt the questions and not give direct answers. She raised the prices on our stay, without our knowledge and refused to breakdown the price of our payment.  The pay for parking was never mentioned, and the we had to inquire why the invoice stated the town home was a one room annex NOT a 5 bedroom town house. The Frech Quarter Suites Hotel website and business are misleading and dishonest."}
{"input": "They were VERY short of staff yesterday but the waiter was extremely sorry & did the best he could! I recommend this place! The food was hot & I felt like we didn't wait too long. We did wait quite a bit for our drinks. I was disappointed that when our meals came that our appetizer came with it too. Other then a busy day. I recommend this Chedders!"}
{"input": "Very expensive!  $10.00 for a 4\" steak sandwich, chips and a drink WTF.  The service wasn't that good.  The two female employees behind the counter weren't friendly.  SMILE sometimes!  If you don't like your job then QUIT!!!!   All that being said, the sandwich was very good.  Just a bit of sticker shock."}
{"input": "I personally have had a good experience so far. Although there were a few problems scheduling my appointment with a personal trainer, my sister and I got a sweet deal on our membership; we got to split the cost since we live in the same household. It can be a bit busy around 5pm but that's a normal occurrence at any gym."}
{"input": "Availability on a Friday/Saturday night is about the only thing this restaurant has going for it. 15 minutes to take our drink order, another hour until your food arrives (2 of which were kids meals). Broccoli was soggy, premium side spinach was rotten.  Bruschetta topped tilapia had only 8 small pieces of diced tomato on it. Salad bar was pretty much empty. \n\nWe've been to this location 4 times in the past year and have consistently left disappointed. Unless they drastically turn things around, we'll never go back."}
{"input": "Very slow service.  Was 10 min after we sat down for anyone to come to the table to do anything other then bringing us water and papadum. Noone seemed to care we were here. To there favor they are busy and the food is food. Not sure it was worth an hour from time we ordered to getting the food to the table."}
{"input": "$28 for two cheesesteaks and a large gravy fries? Cheesesteaks nothing to write home about either.  If your paying that much the steaks should have been the best. Go to Pete's or Lenny's in the neighborhood, you'll pay less but get more. Once this fad dies down the windows will be boarded up, and this place will be another fly by night outfit."}
{"input": "I came back to Santa Barbara for a little pre-Mother's Day weekend getaway. My mom had never been here so it was perfect.  A few months before the trip I knew I just had to reserve a room at Castillo Inn because last time we were very happy with the room, amenities and location. \n\nThis time you were on point Castillo Inn! I reserved the same room as last time because it was very roomy and pretty. There were four of us. The tp and towels were stocked nicely and we didn't run out of either. The wifi was free and fast. The morning breakfast treats were great. My mom loved having her coffee, pastries and fruit. The beds were very comfy. Loved being so close to everything. We didn't have to drive much since everything is a short walk away, or you can ride the trolleys or the water taxi. Had so much fun! \n\nCastillo Inn, your level of service, and the quality of your rooms are to be commended. You are reasonably priced too! Another experience made memorable. Thank you again."}
{"input": "I'm not sure why this place doesn't have more stars, but I love it here! I have been a few times now and have had a great experience every time. The outside seating area is BEAUTIFUL and overlooks the water. The first time I went, I had the \"world's best\" turkey sandwich which is VERY true to the name. Literally the best sandwich I've ever had. I wish I could have that sandwich every day. The next time I went with a large group and we did the bottomless mimosas and bottomless brunch. It's a bit expensive, but as long as you come hungry and thirsty you definitely get your money's worth! You can also make reservations ahead of time which is nice! If your looking for a place with great food and an awesome view, definitely come here!"}
{"input": "Ordered some food at 11:47pm after not eating all day due to airline issues. I was starving. 2 and 1/2 hours later my food was delivered after I called twice looking for it.  When it arrived, there was no utensils or napkins.  I ate my salad with my fingers.  The food is good, the service is horrible.  Never again!"}
{"input": "An amazing and innovative new establishment, we stopped in on a weekend trip from Vegas. Good was excellent (bone marrow was stellar) and the brews were top notch. The corn whiskey was excellent and the service was friendly with a touch of class. We enjoyed it so much that we returned the next night to enjoy more of its diverse menu and beer selection...\n\nMost definitely worth a \"shot\" and Reno is lucky to have this great option for food, beer and whiskey connoisseurs..."}
{"input": "Got the charbroiled oysters. They were great. Little heavy on the garlic. Took a while, but I was made aware there would be a wait."}
{"input": "Extremely competent, prompt and upfront and fair about price. Had an issue that required trouble shooting, some general repairs and adding outlets done to my complete satisfaction. I will use them a gain and give my highest recommendation."}
{"input": "LOVED their Cobb salad. Service however was below standard and the place was a little dirty."}
{"input": "I ordered the Chicken Carbonara and after getting halfway through my dish, I realized it did not have any \"chicken\"???  Instead if apologizing and helping me, both waiters told me the chef had been here for \"30years\"???  Does that mean a mistake can't be made?  I did not agree with the lack of empathy nor did I welcome their tone!\n\nYou guys need to improve and make sure that you treat your customers with more care.....\n\nI am visiting from Los Angeles, CA and I will surely NOT recommend this business.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nJames"}
{"input": "We went late on a Saturday night and sat on the patio! Our server, Robin, was friendly and answered the (many) questions and (many) recommendations I asked for! Food was delicious and the Nutella cheesecake was seriously the best cheesecake I've ever had, which is saying something because cheesecake usually weirds me out. The menu is quite large however I am in the restaurant industry and I really love having so many options, especially at 10:30pm after my shift when I don't even really know what sounds good or what I'll be craving!"}
{"input": "This Dollar Tree puts all other Dollar Trees to shame--I am a bargain hunter, so I've been to a lot of them. This one is super clean, well organized and has a HUGE variety of products. They even have maps of the store by the entrance (and by the cashiers). \n\nDefinitely worth going to, if you're looking for a bargain buy."}
{"input": "As much as I like chicken wings and local restaurants here in Tucson, I don't know how many more times i can stand WOB. As for the wings they are great, always large and perfectly crispy, and totally drenched in sauce. I haven't tried anything else on the menu that I can vouch for. My issue with this place is the service, on the phone it always seems like an inconvenience that I am calling in an order and the call is always rushed. And in person when we are feeling daring enough, the staff always looks like they are in the weeds or behind on all their work. What has brought me to write this review is the mid 30 looking, tall server. Her attitude is unnecessary, her guest interaction screams lack of training and her aura if this counts for anything seems like a black cloud moving through the restaurant. I don't usually let service bother me as long as the food holds up but I just don't like her. And that's that. I'll finish up this dozen of hot, wipe my fingers and contemplate dining in again."}
{"input": "Great service, oysters, crab cake sandwich, crab she chowder and drinks! You should come here!!"}
{"input": "SRS is truly an exceptional management company. They have been extremely accommodating with very specific requests that I have made. Recommend."}
{"input": "Moved to Tucson and needed a new dentist, everything went great here!"}
{"input": "Mike's ice cream is the best, great flavors to chose from.  They moved off Broadway,  but worth it, more room."}
{"input": "This place surpassed our expectations!  The steak is far superior to any steak house I have been too.  The staff flows together like a well trained team, the hostess Mallory, our waiter Max, and the busboy all keep things moving smoothly and leave you never wanting for anything.  Honestly the whole experience was amazing and we will be back for more. Love this place!"}
{"input": "Great place for a happy hour or a group! I'll admit I'm not a big beer fan, but a lot of my friends are, and here, they have beer as well as other drinks, plus a great ambiance. They have a yummy (and cheap) Sonoran hot dog on the menu, too. Live music on some nights. And happy hour prices every time a train passes by! Clean dining area and bathrooms. Fun hangout, away from the mostly busy streets of central Tucson.\n\nThe only downside is the hit or miss service -- hey, sometimes it's super crowded, but still!"}
{"input": "This is my favorite restaurant!  I always order their ceviche, which is delicious.  The atmosphere is fun, and the service is great.  Alex was our server, and he was friendly, attentive and thoughtful."}
{"input": "They have the best bagels in town! I have been coming here since high school and still stop by when I am back in town. The employees are always friendly and efficient."}
{"input": "Staff are wonderful. Bartender was extremely pleasant. Other than that a horrible nightmare. Interesting decor, though trying to hard.Dirty carpeting and dark rooms.  Super loud air conditioning unit, bring ear plugs, or don't sleep. Fancy shower unit but leaky doors and mildew. Light bulb went out in the middle of the night, forced to shower in the dark; no body is regularly changing the bulbs to prevent this. Would avoid staying over night."}
{"input": "Well let's start with the good. Panera type restaurant with good food and laid back atmosphere. Now with the bad a focus on the staff. Every time I go up there the staff seems to really hate being there or has an attitude you'd prefer not to see when walking in a place. It actually makes me not want to go up there for food anymore. Definetly not world class customer service on any scale and the sad thing is, they barely have to interact with you."}
{"input": "Great market. Fresh pasta. Freshly baked bread for $3.50 or less. Fine cheeses. Great wine cellar. Limited produce. Full service meat dept with dry aged beef. Really good sandwiches for unbelievably low prices - $5 to $5.50. Place can get very crowded, especially at lunch time."}
{"input": "No military discount for my son headed to Kuwait to serve our county! Shame on you all! All other places were happy to give the standard discount. Unacceptable!"}
{"input": "Went back in on a Tues. Bar was busy but cleared out. Single bartender. Four of us ordered some food and drinks. Bartender to worried about chatting with other employees than getting us new drinks. Wasn't very knowledgable on types of alcohol they served. Food was so so at best. Stay away from roast beef sandwich. All of our dirty plates stayed with us till the end. Owner just sat at end of bar oblivious to our situation and other patrons with the same issues. Itll be a loooong time before I eat there again."}
{"input": "We stopped by here around 2:00 pm on Saturday and the place was hoppin!  We were promptly seated, so I had a few minutes to look over the place before we ordered the food.\n\nAmbiance:  I have stated before in my reviews that I absolutely loathe it when restaurants rely on big screen TVs for entertaining.  They assume that the majority of people really give a crap about sports.  I don't and I find it really distracting.  The Cheese in Cheeseburger must really mean CHEEEESY DECOR.  Seriously, fake hula skirts on the wait staff?  \n\nFOOD:  I almost didn't want to come here because I remember people saying they charged you for soda refills.  We were not, so they must have changed their policy.  I had the pulled pork sliders.  The meat itself was pretty good, but I didn't like that the bottom of the sandwich was soggy because of the cole slaw.  We also ordered onion rings as an appetizer which were excellent.\n\nOverall, I'm glad I came, but neither the food or ambiance did anything to scream \"Come back, Allie!\""}
{"input": "I requested service because my gas oven heating was unreliable: sometimes, when turned on, it would heat as expected; other times it would not heat and I would smell natural gas odor.\nI was delighted, from the beginning of the process to the end: the person who answered my phone call on Monday and scheduled my appointment was friendly and helpful; appointment was scheduled for Wednesday, which was earlier than appointments offered to me by other appliance repair services that I had called; communication from company - by phone, email, and text - was well-timed and clear; repair technician was on-time and personable; he diagnosed the problem and fixed it efficiently (he had, based on the description that I had given when requesting the appointment, anticipated the cause and brought with him the required replacement component, an igniter); the company waived the service call charge - I paid for the repair (parts and labor) only."}
{"input": "I don't care how long a wait may be this place deserves 5 stars over and over and over again. \n\nYes it's a bit pricey. But the pure fact of being transported to another part of the world the second you step inside is well worth it \n\nI've tried multiple things from the bakery and honestly cannot say a bad thing about any of them. The earls cake though----im drooling as I type. The levels of chocolate in this is actually heaven on earth. It's perfect. And I do not take cake lightly.\n\nThe tea, coffee and champagne selection is also top-notch \n\nOne of my absolutely favorite places in Indy!"}
{"input": "first visit this week, super nice server, awesome food....we loved our dinner and I had the beet salad and scallop risotto....we are going back soon and I think this is going to be one of our go to spots"}
{"input": "Best seafood restaurant ever!! I've had it in the USA & Toronto and was soo happy to learn they just opened in Edmonton! \nWent on Friday of the May long weekend and waiting time was 30mins although I was told it was 45mins to 1 hr. Make sure to go early enough as they do not take reservations.\nSeafood super super fresh. I had shrimps, dungeonese crab, mussles and oysters and corn. Oysters needed a bit of salt. We ordered mussels with garlic butter sauce but next time I'd go with everythin captain boil. \nPrice was surprisingly not as expensive as I thought it'd be.\nI recommend getting the captain's boil house flavour every time! Service was excellent! Waiters kept refilling my pop, one of the best services I've encountered so far! Keep it up Captain's Boil!\nDefinitely recommend this place!"}
{"input": "Ordered Caramel frappe at Drive thru, BIG MISTAKE! Took 30 min and there were only 2 cars in front of me."}
{"input": "I definitely check the bathroom to rate the cleanliness of a restaurant and of all the pho places I've been to, this has been the most clean thus far. Quiet, well decorated & friendly staff that I'm not accustomed to from the pho places in San Francisco; this restaurant surely deserves the rate that it has."}
{"input": "I truly expected more from a burger place owned by St. Elmo's and Harry and Izzy.  The restaurant felt more like a sports bar with all the TVs on and the pop music blaring so loud it made it difficult to focus on my date.  I got the Stanford (turkey burger) and zucchini straws.  The straws where much better than my burger that lacked any real taste.  My date got the Going Greek (lamb burger) and loaded potato salad and once again the side was better than the burger.  I've had better burgers for much less.  I will try it again with a more traditional beef burger to see if it was just the non traditional that didn't work for us."}
{"input": "We stayed in St Louis an extra day to check out downtown St. Charles and finish with lunch at Hendricks. This may be the best BBQ we've ever had. The ribs, brisket, pulled pork, greens, mac-n-cheese were amazing"}
{"input": "I give 2 stars not because of the food, but, the service. Our Server was actually very nice, cheerful and professional! But, waiting 35 minutes for our apps was a bit much! There was a party of 2 seated just before us who managed to eat and leave before our entree even arrived! \nThe house salad is large enough for three people! I had the fried mozzarella which was quite good...as were the onion rings. I had the cheesesteak and fries. Again, not bad at all! The bacon cheeseburger was also very good. Though, the bacon is so thick you could never bite into it on the burger. The bacon of the third person with us was as black as the ace of spades!\nSo, to wrap this up, I wouldn't make a special trip again for dinner because of the slowness. They're recreating the buffet so will make a point to try it out once it reopens."}
{"input": "We love our thai milk boba tea! This place does it great. They're always adding new things too."}
{"input": "the music and the ambience brings you in a different time....best traditional New Orleans Jazz"}
{"input": "Another five-star dining review!  Fresco serves-up wonderful fresh and tasty pizza.  We tried this store as a change in our usual fare when we visit Tucson during the gem shows.  For what you get, their prices are very reasonable.  My husband and I were new, and the friendly young man behind the counter told us about their pizza, how it is made from all fresh ingredients, etc.  The restaurant was very clean and inviting.  We ordered the meat-special pizza, which included chunks of chicken besides the usual sausage, pepperoni, ham and bacon.  The pizza was GREAT!  Crispy AND tender crust, plenty of toppings, and a \"multiple-napkiner.\"  We also had a nice talk with the young owner, and you can tell his business is his passion and only wants to serve the best and highest quality food to his customers.  We will definitely return next year!  Do I recommend Fresco?...YOU BETCHA I DO!!!"}
{"input": "Just found out that Virgil Kelly and Kathy Carlson sold the place. Hubby and I have been customers of theirs for 20 years.  Hope the new owner won't make too many changes to the breakfast (excellent eggs benedict) and lunch menus. Dinner menu needs to have a drastic makeover."}
{"input": "My husband and I ate lunch here a month ago and the experience wasn't the best. We had to wait at least 20 minutes to get our drinks and we heard our waitress complain she was overworked right in front of us... I doubt we will be back."}
{"input": "My favorite spot for brunch and lunch! Be prepared to wait, but the wait is worth it. Friendly staff and terrific food more than make up for the delay... unless you're one of those posters who says \"Nobody eats there anymore - it's too crowded.\""}
{"input": "Wife and I got the eggs Benedict. I am an eggs Benedict lover (I'll Admit it) whoever first decided to put together poached eggs English muffins Canadian bacon and a creamy leaning sauce called Hollandaise is a genius. This eggs Benedict didn't disappoint. The English muffins was crunchy but not over toasted the eggs were poached perfect the Canadian bacon was done solidly and the Hollandaise a homerun. We also both got grits -- I thought they were great the ride thought a shade bland. I'll go with her assessment as she is from the South and so am a transplant. It is a bit pricey $42 for two but we were staying at the Royal Sonesta so it was convenient."}
{"input": "Service was a little slow but food makes up for it. I had the shepherd pie and my husband had the trout. Wow, it was super tasty!"}
{"input": "My visit this Saturday was a complete zero from the time we walked in.... The entire place was so very disorganized. The owner Jerry was screaming at his employees in front of customers and was very arrogant to his dining patrons. Our server admitted to me that things were not in place and that all of his fellow employees were confused and unhappy... after almost 10 mins of waiting for a server to acknowledge we were waiting for service he took our beverage order which took 10 more mins.... Server also communicated to us that no one took the time to review the ordering process with him prior to opening... The food did not match up to past experiences at this restaurant.. We always had Paul serve us and he always and still remains an excellent server, but his tables were all booked! We would have had a better meal at McDonalds!! Will never return to this Hell hole....:"}
{"input": "The pizza is completely tasteless. We ordered 4 different pizzas to try and all were bad. The dough and sauce actually have no flavor. It's too bad. I was so excited to have a good fast pizza place but this is not that."}
{"input": "Recommended by our hotel. They were spot on! We sat at the bar as the wait was an hour for a table.  This was a great choice.  Sarah the bartender was super friendly and helpful.  The cherry limeade delicious  and the burgers fantastic."}
{"input": "The food was great, the service was quick, and the drinks were delicious. The servers have tablets now and it makes the food come out faster--someone actually brought drinks to our table while our server was still telling us about appetizers, how cool!"}
{"input": "My favorite place to eat sushi and the nicest people I know that work there! It'll always be my first choice and they have a great menu! It's always more than just good when you eat from there!"}
{"input": "I love this place. Been three times for their chicken drunken noodles. Came once with a friend who likes his pad Thai and...something else. Their lychee iced tea is good!! Sometimes they have fresh baby coconut that you drink from and then scrape the meat out of--SO GOOD. It's run by a really nice, friendly family."}
{"input": "Prompt and professional. On a Saturday.\nSimple mirror fix, but they made it easy for me. I have used them in Charlotte and they were great then, too."}
{"input": "By far the best cinnamon roll I've had in life!!! Make sure to get it heated, because they heat it \"Cream Brûlée\" style and that's the best part!!"}
{"input": "The best Mexican in the city, hands down. \n\nA little pricey but great happy hour specials. \n\nMy favorite part is the guacamole, which you get to customize by selecting what you want added from a checklist. \n\nThe staff is friendly too and very knowledge of the lengthy tequila list."}
{"input": "This place is very crowded.  The prices are reasonable.  We had two omelets and two coffees.  The food was good but not great.  The eggs were overcooked and the cheese very light so nothing to cover up the overcooked eggs.  Coffee was fine for an all you drink setup.    Four stars because the service was quick and friendly."}
{"input": "Horrible  experience .\nWe been there yesterday with some friends.\nLong time waiting, costumer reclaim for food never come to the table,somebody ask  for pizza they just forget including in the order and when they bring to table was no ready.\nWe order milanese steak wao!!!!! Extremely overcook you cant even cutting ,beans come to the table late and the banana plantain was just ridiculous. \nWe choose this place yesterday\n but am not recommended  to nobody."}
{"input": "I've had about all of their sandwiches and visit this place when I'm in the area during lunch.  I think their bread is great and their prices are phenomenal.  I also enjoy their spring rolls."}
{"input": "So disappointing. Stopped by for the first time Friday night.  There were 3 people at the bar. The rest of the place was empty.  Sat down, no acknowledgement from the staff.  Went up to the bar and took a menu, still no acknowledgement from the staff.  The guy behind the bar walked right past us to get a bottle of wine for the people at the bar, still no acknowledgement.  Finally after 15 minutes of being invisible, we walked out, and still no acknowledgement. We are new to the neighborhood and are wine drinkers.  We really wanted this to be our new hangout. However, we will look for a place that wants to provide service, where we are happy to spend our money."}
{"input": "We wanted salad for lunch so decided to try this place. The older gentleman given the task of making our salads was a complete jerk. After being rushed to give him my toppings order several times, he told me he had other things to do. I responded that we could always go eat elsewhere if that was the case. He shrugged to let us know he didn't care, so out the door we went. Don't go in there if you're new to the establishment and don't know exactly what you want!"}
{"input": "Love this place! Great food, and the owner will help you pick something if you are not sure what to order. Try the king fisher beer. Save room for desert! Great change of pace from regular boring food"}
{"input": "I waited to go a second time before writing a review.  One positive: a variety of healthy smoothie options with fresh ingredients. I really appreciate the lack of added sugars or overuse of ice. However, my first experience far exceeded my most recent visit. The inconsistency in the smoothies makes me hesitant to return. I ordered the same smoothie on both visits. On my second visit, the employee admitted he didn't know how to make all of the menu options; he could definitely use better training. I received a smoothie that likely had all of the listed ingredients, but the proportions of those ingredients were way off. My smoothie only tasted like lemon and celery. It was too sour to finish.  Considering South Tampa's dedication to Xtreme Juice, I  doubt this place will last long given the inconsistency in the smoothies and lack of a BOGO option on Sundays."}
{"input": "Comfortable beds!\nThe hotel is overall very good, but most impressive were the beds... they're comfortable! Most hotels cheap out & buy hard (uncomfortable) beds because they last longer, but Drury's were great and we slept really well.\n\nThe location is good for the value, and the hotel is very accessible.\n\nBathrooms were very clean, and had LOTS of water... more water out of a shower head than I can remember at any hotel ever (usually it's just a trickle).\n\nFree breakfast and snacky dinner were good, though only an idiot would stay in NOLA and fill up on free hotel hot dogs.\n\nThe only negative is the loud hall & door latches. All night long you hear other rooms' doors going KA-CHUNK.\n\nFree WiFi is nice... amazing that some hotels still charge for this.\n\nAfter the Royal Sonesta, this is my new favorite NOLA hotel (and it costs 1/2 as much)."}
{"input": "hmmm...not sure yet.  in the process of seeing about a warranty issue for a defective item.  I'll update once done with the transaction.\n\nupdate:  they handled the warranty issue and i am very satisfied!  great service."}
{"input": "We had two pizzas delivered, loved the flavored crust, all in all very tasty.  Pizza crust was a bit soggy but otherwise good."}
{"input": "Had a maple, cayenne latte- spicy and delicious. Went back another time for lunch and had a chicken, mozz and peach jam with basil sandwhich- YUM. I'm sold. Will definitely go back again :)"}
{"input": "It's good for being a mid-range Indian and Pakistani restaurant, with above-average vegetarian options.  I wasn't completely thrilled with the service and the decor felt schmaltzy but it was exactly the kind of place I was looking for."}
{"input": "I was fully surprise by Beck's Cajun Cafe, I never would've thought that a hole in a wall like this place that is tucked in Reading Terminal Market would be this amazing. \n\nThe staff behind the counter is a trio of mother and daughters working together. They are extremely nice and are willing to give you little samples of jambalaya or gumbo if you ask for it.\n\nI had the Gator Gumbo with Rice and Fried Mac and Cheese ball. I was hoping the mac and cheese was good but it lacked cheese. A lot of mac inside but not even cheese so it was definitely a bit bland. The best part was the Gator Gumbo, packed with cajun spices and a lot of gator sausage and meat. This was absolutely amazing and a must get at Beck's.\n\nA place worthy of a return when I visit Philly again."}
{"input": "I like that Sally's has more options for hair supplies than any other beauty store in the area. The staff is nice and friendly and everything is usually well stocked. Sally's is my go to when I feel like experimenting with my hair due to the wide array of products they carry. I do wish the staff was a little more knowledgable on what they carry but I understand that that's a lot to ask. I also wish that the store was bigger, brighter and cleaner. The cramped aisles, dust bunnies and flickering, yellow fluorescent lights don't exactly give that same \"beauty/trendy\" feeling that other beauty stores have. If I could give one piece of advice to management it would be to work on the appearance of the store, other than that I'm pretty happy with Sally's."}
{"input": "I went to this salon to get the devacut which is dry cutting for naturally curly hair and I came out in love! My stylist was Mario he did an amazing job on my hair. I have dry, thin 3a 3b hair and he knew exactly what to do. He did my cut which I needed badly and diffused and used Devachan products. Love it!! Thanks Mario!\n\n*You have curly hair? Get your hair cut here!*"}
{"input": "Dined here this past Friday night for dinner. The restaurant has a very casual feel to it. The food was delicious! We started with the complimentary garlic oil and garlic knots. What's not to like?\n\nMy friends and I split a salad and the fried risotto balls. Two of us ordered the chicken parm (delish) and my other friend ordered the steak which was also delicious. We shared a piece of cheesecake that melted in your mouth.\n\nThe portions are huge (that's what she said) :)\n\nOur server Jenni was fantastic!  Accommodating, friendly and efficient!\n\nBocconcini is also BYOB which I love.\n\nWould definitely recommend!"}
{"input": "Stumbled on this while walking Mass Ave to the hotel site seeing. Had a cup of coffee and a Veggie, Egg & Cheese breakfast sandwich on toast. Loved it.\n\nThey have a great selection of sandwiches and drinks."}
{"input": "Meh.  Kinda under cooked and doughy.  Ild image it's pretty average when fully cooked."}
{"input": "I love this place - their food is just cafe style but I always enjoy what I order. Lots of GF options which I don't necessarily need but my sister has Celiac's so it's awesome to have the choice! I love the coconut chai with coconut milk! This place also has a fun vibe to hang out or study. I would definitely recommend it and come here often!"}
{"input": "Without a doubt. ....some of the best barbeque I've had this side of Texas.  The meat was smoked so well, you didn't need sauce.  It was offered on the side and the sauces were good too. I also had their collard greens and mac and cheese.  My sister had the smoked wings and she said they were delish. Her cocktail was a Metropolitan that had kick.\nThe staff was friendly and offered a shot that tasted like apple pie. The bar is loaded with tasty treats including Jameson Cask Mates.\nMy sister lives in Texas and I live in California. We were in town for a family funeral but next time we're here,  we'll come back. Highly recommended by our cousin Scott."}
{"input": "This place has an amazing lunch special. I definitely recommend the lunch special that has two sushi rolls and a salad for 9 dollars. If you go to Jefferson it is really close by as well, so definitely come after exams."}
{"input": "Very good for breakfast. The portions are huge. Our server Frank was very attentive and made sure everything was great. The manager Tim came over and we ask if we needed something cooked special for allergy reasons and he said yes they can accommodate for that, just let the server know when ordering. Coffee is very good and my wife had the tea and it was also good."}
{"input": "We came with the family for a late lunch. Kids each had a kid's meal; adults each had a pizza. We had an order of bread sticks as well. Service was friendly, but it took a long time for our food to come, despite the short cooking time of the pizza in the fire. Kid portions are small, but I have kids on the older side of kid menu appropriateness. Adult pizzas were spectacular. I had the wild mushroom (with added bacon). Other adult was a different veggie Pizza, also very good. Kids described the pepperoni as just right in spiciness, with a nice crispiness.  All in all, we enjoyed it and will return. Just make sure you have enough time in your schedule if you go."}
{"input": "Usually packed with conference/event attendees from the nearby Convention Center. Totally worth the wait in line. They tend to have quick turnovers so the wait isn't all that long. If you go definitely try their freshly made in house juices. That's their specialty but their food is also great; I never leave a morsel on my plate (yes the manager teased me about this and gave me free coffee lol). The owners are great and that's reflected in the staff they hire."}
{"input": "Spider, spider everywhere! Best for the Halloween day ;-) We had to literally kill a few spiders inside the washroom and one nearby the bed. Worst hotel I ever lived... Even non-smoker room smell smokey, tiles and fixtures were broken (check the posted pics), and the water was dripping all night. The whole corridor felt damp and smell nasty :-0 We were forced to stay here, as there wasn't anything else nearby, and we were unfamiliar of the city, and it was 9:00 at night to search another after 8 hours of driving :-("}
{"input": "Such a great spot!!! Authentic, amazing food with many options and super friendly staff. Food tastes fresh and comes with really good portions. Wish These were all over America!"}
{"input": "This store has the worst customer service time and time again. \n\nThis morning I went in at 11am (when they open) and there were probably four other customers browsing the store. I turned the corner and the associate looking shocked said \"we don't open until 11.\" I said it is 11 and her other associate said yeah it is 11. She then said well let me check. Comes back and said no one will be at register because they're closed. (The door to the front was open)\n\nI asked if I could buy something and she looked at me like I was dumb and said \"ya.\" \n\nI was both confused and annoyed so I left. \n\nThree times before this the service was also terrible."}
{"input": "This place is a gem.Attractive space, great location near Broad Street line, plenty on street parking. BYOB. I've been twice and enjoyed every dish. Highlights were the chaats, beef short ribs, lamb vindaloo, beet salad, breads/pickles, and chai. We got the chocolate cake for the table to share each time and everyone loved it. Can get takeout beer at the corner bar. We'll be back."}
{"input": "This grovstyles is very unprofessional and took forever for my order to come in and never do I shop there again"}
{"input": "Tasty Mexican food nothing fancy, they did have a salsa bar that was really good and about 100 different bottles of hot sauce.  Everything comes with endless chips. All and all I was happy with the food and the price."}
{"input": "Went for Sunday brunch. Arrived a little after 11 and the place was empty. Service was friendly and helpful. Prices on food were good, but drink prices were a little high. Definitely cheaper in Old City. Anyway, the food was great. Fresh and hot and huge portions; neither of us could come close to finishing. Only food complaint was the bacon was way under cooked; needs to be crisper.\nBy the time we left, the place had started to fill up, so get there early for a spot. Definitely will return."}
{"input": "This is by far the best pizza in the area.  Brick oven and very tasty.  We love getting the special sodas there as a extra treat.  Tony is so friendly.  We usually get take out or delivery.  I love this place!"}
{"input": "Got there and lady's was not welcoming but neutral asking if we were ready. Took a while then finally I ordered a special chicken sandwhich.  9 almost 10 dollars for that lemonade and fries(medium). Sat down and my order was ready in less then a minute.  Excited because I was starving then upon opening it looked so dryyyy tasted dry, outside was crunchy. Friends burger was greasy like dripping grease. Fries and drink was bomb. Didn't bother complaining just ate and left. Had to go to pole vault summit. Decided to leave a review instead."}
{"input": "I should have known it would be a bad experience from the beginning. The chips tasted stale and the salsa tasted like ketchup. Old el paso salsa from the jar would have been better. The guacamole lacked flavor, I suggest they add some cumin. The enchiladas tasted like they had Vodka sauce on them and the onions inside tasted like they weren't cooked. The tacos had cabbage on them.\n The best part of the meal was the margarita. The strawberry margarita was really good. \nThe gentleman collecting the plates dropped a dirty knife on my cream colored shirt. I didn't say anything, we just got the check and left. We will not be returning."}
{"input": "All over good food. Not super fancy, but I have never had something there that I did not like. \n\nRecommended items: \n\nMarathon Burger\nBasil Lemonade (alcoholic)\nDark and Stormy (alcoholic)\nVegetarian Chili (awesome!!)\nFire-roasted salsa\nCrispy Buffalo Chicken Sandwich\nSouthwest Salad\n\nGreat place to get a decently priced meal and is easy to get into any day of the week."}
{"input": "It was amazing! We went as a big group and they were able to handle us well. All of the captains were amazing. They knew the history and how to get the animals to come out. If you're close by, this is not a experience you will want to miss!"}
{"input": "So I'm not a huge Greek food fan, but the souvlaki from Zorba's was quite amazing. The restaurant is a classic little Philly spot that doesn't look like much from the outside, but let's it's food so the talking. The people i was with, who do like Greek food, were gushing about the excellent hummus and Greek salad... \n\nI will happily return to Zorba's again."}
{"input": "not a bad little burger joint. i got the bacon cheeseburger. bacon was cooked perfect and had the perfect thickness. bun had a really great toasted crust. fries were good, as well as the chocolate shake I had. 3 complaints, i wish the burger was more juicy, I wish I wasn't paying so much for the tiny burger portion I was served, and I wish I didn't leave the place smelling like burger grease."}
{"input": "Excellent, tender, delicious BBQ. The potato salad was creamy and the potatoes had the perfect consistency. The beans were sweet and tangy. Soooo good. The staff was really friendly and kind and all of our food took minutes to receive. :)"}
{"input": "This place has a great selection of anything you need, it's also very spacious. The staff is kind and quick, and I like that. They are a bit on the pricey side if you are purchasing hard liquor (which is why I am giving 4 stars instead of 5). If you are buying beer, or hard soda, the price is normal."}
{"input": "A friend suggested this cafe for a lunch date a while back and I cannot stay away. My husband is obsessed with their Peanut Butter Deluxe smoothie. And while Its an obsession I cannot afford to indulge - their bread is what dreams are made of. I love to get their soup due jour over brown rice. Yum! Whether its Breakfast or Lunch - you can't go wrong at Cafe Deluxe."}
{"input": "For those of you (possibly the select few) that don't know Gillane's has been under new management since the summer, EVERYTHING is different, and will remain in transformation for what seems to be awhile now. With that being said the food has now evolved into a spectacular meal that is no long \"so-so\" (and without changing the menu might I add). And how could you forget those crazy clowns? Well now you can! Because not a single one is in sight and they can no longer stare at you while you eat (and I swear I saw one of them move awhile ago). But not only are the disappearance of the clowns a change, but there are gorgeous flat screen TV's down at the bar that if the food doesn't make you drool those will! With new silverware, glassware, plates, placemats and booths Gillane's seems to only be getting STARTED with it's renovations. So I will definitely be coming back not only for the new and improved great food but also to see what's next!"}
{"input": "Fantastic new store! Huge and bright, and so much great stuff! There's a deli with freshly made meal options to go (lasagna, salads, sides, etc), gorgeous desserts, a meat department with meat already marinating, and so many more aisles filled with other food.  Bulk bins as well with lots of beans/lentils. They have frozen meat and fish, and the prices looked reasonable to me.\n\nThe produce section seemed kind of small when you take into account how big this store is, and the actually didn't have something I was looking for.\n\nThis is overall a great organic grocery store!"}
{"input": "This is my very first time and I have to say the Mexican mocha is super good and chocolate-y but packs quite a spice!! That's how delicious it is!! I will be definitely coming back since it is the bang for the buck and it is an awesome place to get coffee and some studying done."}
{"input": "If you are shopping for any kind of Italian food product, you need not bother going anywhere but Claudio's.  First, you must understand the culture--Claudio's is old school.  They are family.  There is a reason everyone lines up and tolerates standing in line.  The product is THAT good.  These folks know their cheeses.  They know their food.  If you have a question, they will bend over to help you.  Other customers will too!  I'm \"medigan\" as they say, American....ie  I am not Italian.  Hanging in Claudio's makes me want to be!!  Going to Claudio's isn't like running to the Acme for a box of pasta----this is an EXPERIENCE.  Everyone should have an experience!"}
{"input": "After a full day of snorkeling, the ice cream was delicious.  It is located inside of the hotel, but if you ask they will let you park for free.  They had a wide variety of flavors and Starbucks coffee.  Seating is in an air conditioned room with old fashioned tables."}
{"input": "Food was a bit bland. I didn't feel the taste was worth all the calories I knew I was consuming."}
{"input": "This is a great place to visit if you enjoy large crowds and overspending.\n\nThey have plenty of delicious deli and bakery items available but you generally can't see either case over crowds while you wait, and if you don't know your order immediately when your numbers called you are S.O.L! They will very quickly call the next person in line so my advice would be to arrive the second they open so that you actually stand a chance of seeing the cases.\n\nIt's a great place for extroverts, but it's very small and very very full of people, so if you're the type of person who is not into that sort of thing, I would probably try to go in the most non-peak hours you can."}
{"input": "My boyfriend and I spent New Years Eve at Tzin and it was one of the best experiences we have ever had. The restaurant is small but cozy with the addition of pillows on the booth side of the tables. We were both a little apprehensive about the dinner going into it because the pre-set dinner for New Year's Eve was a little pricey ($140/person for 5 smaller courses and a bottle of wine) but it was worth every penny! The food is out of this world. I'm actually disappointed that it took us this long to eat there. We will for sure be back!"}
{"input": "This easter instead of going to Lopez Lake we went to Los Padres National Forest which is really pretty but if you go to white rock the staff needs to cut down all the dead grass that invades the rock and the water. I would wish the staff would also clean or get rid of the dead grass that's also living by the water. The water is really green and dirty. Los padres national forest staff need to work hard to maintain this forest looking pretty and not like a dumpster. Even Cachuma lake looks like they put a bit more effort."}
{"input": "Specialty Sazerac. Specialty moonshine! Yucca fries. Brie, garlic cloves, onions, and bread. Butternut squash ravioli with mascarpone. Streak and (crab) cake. Scallops. Seriously, the scallops! Apple and goat cheese pie. Need I say more? Ok, I will: all were mind-blowing! Best meal of my life. And live music to boot! I had an amazing night here."}
{"input": "The food and service were just like the old days at Tony Angelo's.  This time we had the marinated mushrooms, lobster cup (now a seafood cup and veal parm.). Next trip will definitely be the the Feed Me."}
{"input": "Great, rotating, draft list.  Good pizzas, salads, wings.  All around pretty solid menu!  Get's very busy during happy hours, games and weekends."}

{"input": "Great place if you are a carnivore...and if you're not try the sides!\n\nI've had everything off of this menu and it's all delicious.  Pulled pork, BBQ chicken sandwich..rack of ribs, corn salad, mac and cheese, baked beans...just writing this is making me hungry.\n\nIt's so awesome to have something this good and this authentic in the hood.\n\nNOT expensive either.  Informal but cozy."}
{"input": "I started going there after being charged and insane amount at another place in Tucson for a full set. The prices are extremely reasonable and I love them every single time! The customer service is outstanding as well! The lash tech I see is Joy, she is amazing! I have sensitive skin and my eyes get irritated easily and whenever she put the eye pads on she asks if its bothering me or if she needs to adjust anything. She also goes over the length and type of lash i want before she starts (i don't really know the terms for everything) but I personally like a natural look but just making my lashes look fuller and she does it every time!! Just explain what you're looking for and you'll get it! If you need a new reliable lash place, this is the place to go!!"}
{"input": "Restaurants don't have to have $50 entrees to be great.  This hole in the wall is ran by a nice family and offers 7 different types of BBQ Sauces made in house!  The Maque Choux Mac is one of the best things I've ever had.  For under $15 you can enjoy that with their many times of sandwiches and/or meat selections."}
{"input": "We absolutely love this place.  It's just the right touch of Old Town Florissant you would love out of town visitors to see."}
{"input": "Today was my first time at Frequency and my second time getting tattooed by Dave McCall.  Overall, I had a really great experience. Everyone was very professional and the shop was clean and I felt very comfortable there. I am extremely happy with how my tattoo turned out, and I will be back in the near future."}
{"input": "This is the first time I went to the Brandon service center. They perform the job I asked them to however, there were other things I mention to them I was concerned about regarding my car and they did not check these things out. When I asked about this they said they could only do what I asked them to do. Example: The car is on a lift. You remove my tires to check the brakes. When I come to pick up my car, I ask do I need tires? mechanic I did not check. I only check what you ask me to check. There is more to this, but why bother I will continue using tires plus on Bloomingdale, Plant City (preferred location) Plant City. better customer service. Bloomingdale was one of the best until they changed managers. I will never use this location again."}
{"input": "Mexican \"comfort\" food....love from a truck."}
{"input": "Waited an hour for a Caesar salad with a tiny chicken finger on it that cost an extra $5. Sadly the hour wait was the typical story of the night for anyone that stopped here during GMX. The place did not seem that busy as far as restaurants go, so maybe they're not used to the traffic. \n\nThe salad was not worth $15. If I hadn't gotten it with chicken I would have been sorely disappointed, though it was sad even with the $5 chicken finger on it. \n\nThe food is cooked in the restaurant, but the server has to walk out of the restaurant and across the hall to the bar to get your drinks (at least alcoholic ones). The same goes for the bar: the food comes from the restaurant across the hall."}
{"input": "We'd been searching for just the right chairs to go with our dining table and not having much luck finding anything we liked that was reasonably priced, until we stopped in at the Ashley Home Store in Edwardsville. Our sales rep, Todd Shaak, was very helpful (and funny) and made our shopping experience a pleasant one. I will definitely go back again should we need any furniture in the future."}
{"input": "Sat. Jun. 10,17        \nRoom 115: \nMade a stop in SB late evening arrived at 8pm to leave at 7am. Next morning.\nThe Place is pretty clean. Being that I had stayed here before about 5yrs ago.\nSo I called to see if there were any rooms available, which there was, they quoted me a price but when I go there it was $30 above what they had quoted me. I needed to rest so I ended up paying the $160\nI gave them 3 stars because the bed was hard and Walls are thin, can hear ppl next door talking and ppl upstairs walking. I was tired and wanted to rest after a long drive but it made it a bit difficult withe the noise."}
{"input": "Absolutely amazing.  Stayed  here  for  our wedding and they decorated  our room  without  us even requesting it. It was so sweet. I cannot  wait  to come back for our 1st  anniversary.  The breakfast was so nice as well. LOVED everything.  Thank you to all at The Eagle Inn. Great staff."}
{"input": "I really loved Ralph's. We came here for a rehearsal dinner for a friend. The space is lovely. The balcony upstairs offers nice views of City Park. \n\nThe staff was very good and friendly. We had a set meal. Started with some delicious gumbo. I had the red fish which was outstanding. Spicy and peppery with a not too heavy sauce. My friends found the potatoes a bit salty but I didn't notice. I also tried the shrimp dish which was excellent. We ended with a bread pudding that was a good sweet end to dinner. \n\nReally enjoyed Ralph's and would love to come back some time."}
{"input": "We ordered delivery because I'm sick at home. For $12 carnitas that was supposed to come with cilantro, onion and salsa, non of these was included. they came with only a little bit of meat in two taco shells and tasted unseasoned. My pork shoulder was very chewy and was supposed to come with pickles but didn't.  The beans, potato salad, and coleslaw were all filled less than half way. Only good things are the toasts. We will not order from this place ever again."}
{"input": "What an awesome place. One of the best dinners I've had in a while, as well as great service and a neat atmosphere.\nThey have a great selection of beer-the melon Gose was outstanding. \nYou have to order the whipped feta and hummus small plates. The whipped feta has honey in the middle, served with warm pita... it's life changing. \nMy friend knew one of the chefs, so we were lucky enough for him to select a few items for us. The tomato & corn dish was outstanding and the Korean fried quail--amazing. Something I would never order on my own, venture out and try this because it's great.\nI can't wait to go back. I've been for brunch and definitely liked their dinner menu more (pickled shrimp is great), but I'll be back to try new items for sure.\nSo impressed!!! Love butcher & bee"}

{"input": "I love this super cute, super delicious pie shop!  Kelly the owner makes delicious pies from scratch, including the famed Sugar Cream - which I had today for the very first time and was blown away by how good it was.\n\nThey've got coffee and tea and other little goodies to buy and cute tables inside and out where you can sit and enjoy your little slice of heaven or just buy a whole pie already to go and take it home to enjoy. :)"}
{"input": "So my fav thing about Cracker barrel is the store. The restaurant is spacey inside and our server was really nice but the food was typical chain style southern food. I wasn't blown away in fact I didn't eat most of it. I got the chicken fried Chicken and it was overcooked, the breading was hard on my teeth and I'm only 30 lol but it wasn't great. The mac and cheese was bland too but the cucumber tomato salad was good. My fiance loved his food though but he's from New Jersey, I'm from the South so I know southern food. I kept hearing all this hype about cracker barrel and how great it is so i was really excited to try it and I was really disappointed. It's just not great food by any means and for anyone else who knows southern food, you will probably be disappointed too unless you like mediocre stuff. The shop however is a gem they have so much stuff I felt like a kid. The staff was really friendly there too."}
{"input": "This review is for a corporate event in a private dining room with a limited food menu & bar. \n\nI was blown away! One of the best meals I've ever had and service was flawless, expert, courteous, and never intrusive. Passed hors d'ouevres were creative and tasty. Lobster consommé was delicious and filet was PERFECTLY cooked & seasoned, melted in my mouth, and a generous portion. And that view is just stunning! Actually a better view from our private room than the main dining room, where I've been for a happy hour event (which was less perfect since the space was very overbooked resulting in slow service). Highly recommend for an event and may be back here for a special occasion dinner."}
{"input": "I had a really great first visit to Growler's Taphouse! The beer selection is really great and our server made some excellent selections, I usually don't expect much food wise from a place with a lot of beer but the food here was pretty great! I ordered the pork sliders and chips & salsa, the hot salsa was so good!!!"}
{"input": "A great option in the French Quarter for good food and service.  Everyone was happy with their meal and the well-priced wine.  Only flaw was the terrible dry reheated bread with the over salted butter, skip that to save room for the meal, which, like everything in New Orleans, is not light.  Not the classic New Orleans dishes for the most part but brings in the flavors.  I had the crab cake and the red fish, both delicious."}
{"input": "This place always delivers. Yet another great year with hayrides, pumpkin picking, and lots of other activities."}
{"input": "Beautiful atmosphere with locally sourced kitchen made everything . Located right in the middle of 12th south and the popular angel wings mural - great place for brunch/lunch if you're in the area. Fries were nice and crispy while the lavender hibiscus tea was gentle and refreshing . This time I ordered safe but I can't wait to come back and try something new, maybe for dinner as our waiter suggested."}
{"input": "Arrive between 7am-9am on a weekday and get their breakfast bargain! Two eggs, home fries or LATKE, toast or biscuit, and bottomless coffee all for FOUR DOLLARS!\n\nThe service was amazing and I got a delicious breakfast and experience for less than it costs to take the bus to and from work."}
{"input": "Very friendly staff and nice environment although the crowd was light surprisingly the both times I went there. Get yourself a $3.50 margarita after 4 on Tuesdays, they are pretty good."}
{"input": "$2 for a drip coffee. I had the Corsica blend, which is delicious. 50¢ refills, which is a nice deal if you plan on staying a bit to read or work. My first time here, and I'll definitely be back. Great prices in Rittenhouse for a good cup of Joe. Staff was friendly, line moved very fast. Highly recommended."}
{"input": "Had a vegan chicken burger and it was delicious! Tasty with good spices. Small space inside and a bit crowded when you are waiting for the food. But no long wait, exceptionally fast and this was during lunchtime. Perfect if you order food to go."}
{"input": "The lovely ladies of Rathbone Mansions get a five star rating.  We were here in early June, and we were pleasantly surprised.  I only say surprised, because of some of the previous reviews.  I completely agree with the previous reviewer who said if you want a Hilton, stay at a Hilton.  It's an old house. Our room was nice and comfortable.  The pool was a great afternoon respite.  It's so easy to walk to Frenchman Street and the French Quarter from here.  Over the weekend, we went to the Zydeco Festival in Louis Armstrong Park a short distance away, and Ms. Pat was so nice to offer up some lawn chairs for us to take.  We'll be staying here the next time we're in NOLA."}
{"input": "Staff was nice. Food was similar to dominos or Pizza Hut on a bad day. Place was dirty and out dated."}
{"input": "We stopped by a couple of weeks ago for Sunday brunch.  The food was very good and filling.  Nice drinks, and we had a very pleasant server.  Cool cafe space.  Overall a good recommend."}
{"input": "Awesome service! Food is made quickly but accurately. It is so fresh. I just wish they delivered to me but it's good enough that I am willing to drive there to get it. Also try their day old bread for .50. It is a full baguette and makes great garlic bread to accompany your dinner!"}
{"input": "Stopped by for a quick lunch. Very pleased to find a nice salad on the menu! Also have Sirloin sandwich, a hot chicken sandwich wrap and a tempting New Nashville Burger. My big salad only cost $6. Can't wait to try their dinner menu sometime."}
{"input": "This place just opened up near rivers edge apartments. It's a boutique style taqueria with a menu that anyone can enjoy. The head chef was nominated for a James Beard Award and it shows in his flavorful and diverse menu choices! The restaurant has both an outdoor and indoor setting with double doors that allow access to both, with a bar around the corner. \n\nI personally have tried every taco on the menu as well as the appetizers! Each taco uses fresh local ingredients with an option for vegetarians and meat eaters like myself. My two favorites are the mushroom taco and the short rib taco, both have unique and fantastic flavors. But I would recommend trying them all, you will not be disappointed! Overall a great place for lunch or dinner! I will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"input": "Disc replay is where you want to go if you want an old game or movie on the cheap or if you just can't find it anywhere else. \n\nneed a classing nintendo controller or a PS3 rock band drum set? They have it.\n\nPersonally, I bought super mario cart for super nintendo. If you're not excited about that, then you have no soul. the $15 price tag was more than fair."}
{"input": "Food and coffee are great. Just have 30\nMinutes to stand in line and wait for the ONE cashier to make change. Either they fix this and add another cashier or they will be dead. Shouldn't have to wait for one cashier while 5 other folks stand behind the one cashier watching the line grow. Adds other till!"}

{"input": "Wow!!! A client recommended this place to me. Like a million other New Yorkers, our move to Tampa has NOT found great food. This place is the real deal. If I could give ten stars I would. Deli/ coffee/ bakery.... homemade pasta. Everything you need and even what you don't. This will be on my monthly shopping list for sure. Treat yourself!\n\nP.s.... the meatball parm sub was amazing, well worth the drive from Tampa!!"}
{"input": "This is a lovely place for some amazing Chinese food! The restaurant is so clean and updated. The staff is very polite and friendly. The menu has a wide selection of items even kids menu is pretty large. I personally can't get enough to do the orange chicken. It's amazing!! A must try!"}
{"input": "I did not end up purchasing a vehicle here, but the shopping experience was straight-forward and better than most other dealerships. \n\nI found that their list prices were fair and competitive, as well as the certification and warranties on used vehicles - I just chose a different car make/model than I shopped for at Hallmark. The salesman and sales manager were nice and were not pushy. I was able to quickly get attention and test drive the car I wanted to check out. \n\nHad I liked the car better than what I was comparing it to, I would have likely bought from them. Based on some pretty terrible experiences at other places, I would recommend trying this dealership if you are looking to buy locally."}
{"input": "Worst service ever.  \nAfter waiting 45 mins called and they say driver just left 20 mins late same story finally after almost 2 hours the wrong food shows up as well as everything disgusting. Called back listened to owner yell at waitress about this wile I'm listening so I drive there for a refund and over arguing w me even though order was horrible ..   wow worst food worst service and the owner is completely unprofessional..."}

Super friendly staff, great lunch specials as well. My schedule is off a lot of days so my  lunches can start late but this restaurant stays open all day which I like. Many other spots close after lunch and don't open again until 5 or 530 for dinner. \n\nOverall, great food, great staff, nice environment!Recommended"}

{"input": "Quite possibly the perfect business model to fail if it wasn't for a sequestered clientel?  We visit New Orleans often, and it is an activity of ours to bet on how many beers or ingredients they are out of.  Bartenders rude and swearing. It's almost comical, we sit and listen to patrons asking for draft beers and mixed drinks and getting responses \"can't do that\".  They said \"No mules\", to at least 5 people as we sat for about 30 mins today.  2 out of 4 taps not working. What an absolute waste of opportunity."}
{"input": "I've been to many art museums and was surprised to see a museum this beautiful with such a great collection to be FREE! I was so happy to have had discovered this museum in my short time in Indianapolis. I loved the African Art and the Modern Art sections (although I did make a mistake taking out my camera for the Modern Art museums.. that's a no no). The outdoor sculpture garden and gift shop was awesome as well. Highly recommended!"}
{"input": "I love it!  The reviews were great and I was desperate for good carry out, so we decided to try Pizzaville (is anyone else picturing JT singing - Bring it on down to Pizzaville?).  The prices are a bit high, but the quality of the food is great!  The pizza crust is between a hand tossed and thin crust.  Perfectly crunchy ends and just chewy enough in the middle.  Good quality cheese and tangy tomato sauce. I ordered it with just mushrooms and they put on a lot!   I also asked for heavy sauce.  They put extra sauce on the pizza and even gave me an extra container of sauce in case I needed more. \n\nI can't decide which was better, the pizza or \"breadsticks.\"  I say \"breadsticks\" because they were really more like garlic bread strips.  So buttery and garlicy, they were great even without sauce.  I'm ashamed to say I ate nearly the entire order myself.  \n\nThe employees are very nice and helpful.  The store is clean. I need to go back and try their lunch buffet."}
{"input": "There's not much to say except that this place is magical.\n\nAwesome candies! Pralines made on the spot.. great fudge and a cool building.. enter on Decatur, exit on Peter's.\n\nThey are so friendly you can taste your way right through the shop. So we did.\n\nWe also bought too much. Which we ate... and then wished we had more.\n\nA worthwhile side trip, it kind of made our day!"}
{"input": "We lived out of town and trying to plan a wedding that way is very difficult.  George Street to the rescue!  We met with a local coordinator who let us review online portfolios of photographers from the area we were getting married.  We chose our package which was the awesome special they were having.  An online portal was created for us so we could set a detailed  timeline for the big day.  The photographer and videographer called us the week before the wedding to check in and go over special details and to connect on a human level.  We knew we had chosen well by the conversation.  Everyone was so awesome to work with and they were definitely our favorite vendor from the wedding.  Highly recommended by a satisfied bride!!"}
{"input": "Happy International Burger Day! We have been coming here for a couple years and haven't been disappointed. Hubby always has the Spicy Crunch combo and I had the Double Mushroom Double Cheese combo one with curly fries the other with regular fries each came with ketchup and a herb aioli as well as a fountain pop. I have also tried the Blue Cheese burger and their signature BJ Burger which are equally delicious. Fresh quality ingredients are used. We would give it a 5 but we thought the tables and benches could be updated. You have the option of customizing your burgers as a mini clip board and marker are at each table with a list of ingredients. Unfortunately diners have scribbled on the tables and benches. Perhaps a sheet of glass or plexiglass on the tables would make it easier to clean."}
{"input": "Was in town for a week and came by this little hole in the wall.  The pa nang chicken was excellent.  I ordered one star spicy and it came quick.  Will definitely return."}
{"input": "Definitely gone downhill. It's still an ok buffet, but nothing special. I used to love the Mongolian grill, where they would cook to order. You would select chicken/beef/pork with various vegetables, sauces, and it would come out hot. It was healthy, fresh,and delicious. \n\nThey no longer have the Mongolian grill at the buffet. None of the Reno buffets come close to the ones in Las Vegas, but for the $, this one is still ok. Just not worth going out of your way for anymore. \n\nIf they bring back the grill, my rating wlll increase to 4 starts for sure."}
{"input": "Went for lunch. Beef brisket sandwich was awesome.   So juicy and tender.    Pulled pork was was just as good!"}

{"input": "Customer service is terrible. Got no help at the store. Went online and ordered a matress. Had to wait 9 days. I was told that it would be delivered between 4:30-6:30, it did not arrive until 10:00. I received no updates about the delay. I had to keep calling the customer service line to find out what is going. Then, they would not haul away the old mattress. This is poor customer experience. I would have gotten quicker delivery and better service than this from a mattress store. Go to a mattress store not SEARS."}
{"input": "This is a great bar....excellent bartenders especially Taylor!!! The manager bobby is great as well...as for the waiter joe, he's okay, hit or miss actually....he has great teeth and very attractive to look at but he's been here for months and stillll doesn't know the menu...he's great though and owes his roommates a lot of money so make sure you tip him well! Highly recommend this bar, it's my spot for sure!!!"}
{"input": "Good place for a burger and a great beer.  Can't beat the two for one Wednesday's!  The atmosphere and ambiance is pretty awesome.  They did a great job with the renovation of the old fire house and the construction of the additions.  Got to love a place where you can play corn hole!"}

{"input": "I had Angie for a 20 min chair massage. She was incredibly skilled and tough on my stubborn knots. I loved every painful second of it. As I sit at my gate writing this review, my back is so relaxed and no longer tense. I highly recommend Angie! Overall, I thought they were understaffed and the wait times reached over 90 minutes at one point. Noise level was a little less-than relaxing with the service providers having to field questions or ring up shoppers' purchases. The store is cute, sells indie products from Indy artists. Prices sent bad on the products and services. If I were in the airport again, I would totally come back, especially to get a massage from Angie."}
{"input": "This is a great workout, however, it is not truly yoga practice. There was blasting music while we were in savasana. I don't think the teacher stopped barking orders at the class the whole time. I appreciate the workout, but I'm really missing the spiritual aspect of the practice here. Maybe turn down the music guys. Check out some other places in town"}

{"input": "We came here for a conference and paid for breakfast and lunch. The breakfast consisted of bottled oj and aj, bread, and fruit. We got a salad for lunch one day, a sandwich the next, and a wrap the next. On the last day, we had a banquet. With beer at $7-8, we decided not to buy anything. I was not given a choice of how I wanted my steak and it came out medium and dry. I much prefer a juicy medium rare steak, thanks. Also my friends happened to have great areas of fat on their steak, which was unfortunate. We had a window room that overlooked the pool, but the window was locked shut and the balcony was unreachable. The 3 elevators are very slow and we couldn't even find the stairs the first day because they were hidden away. The trash cans in the rooms are small enough to fit one or two bottles of water. The only restaurants around are TGIF, some italian place, Burger King, and Papa Johns. The stores in the airport close at 8, so you'd best stock up on drinks before the night begins."}
{"input": "Ok so this was my first vegan meal and it did not disappoint. I ordered the chipotle \"chicken\" wrap with cabbage and sweet potato fries with siraracha aioli which was delicious! \n\nThe location itself is a quaint spot located in university city and the staff was very pleasant.\n\nThey had delicious looking desserts which I did not partake in but I look forward to to trying some my next time back."}
{"input": "Holy crap, we had an awesome time here. We did the $35 customized lunch and got a lot of special attention. The chef (Yun) was from Puerto Rico but had spent time in NC and we talked some about that. The sushi started out terrific and just got more creative and tasty from there. The flavor combinations were not only creative, but sensibly ordered so that they complemented eachother, culminating in what felt like a gourmet meal from appetizer to dessert. The slightly odd feeling of sitting at a campus dining hall take away counter at Penn State quickly diminished as we realized we were getting the best seats and the best deal in the house. We might as well have been out for a nice dinner."}
{"input": "Whoa this place is good!!  Took my family there last night and was totally impressed. I had the heirloom tomato salad with salmon---WOW. Huge heirloom tomatoes with fresh burrata cheese piled high on peppery arugula with a fantastic olive oil simple dressing--and then a side of perfectly grilled salmon-- just excellent. Burgers were off the charts good as were sweet potato fries. Check this place out and you won't be disappointed. Remember to bring wine!"}
{"input": "This place is awesome! Had to come here on the first day of our honeymoon because I got bronchitis. The doctor told me he would fix this and he did! Everyone here is so nice, I definitely recommend this place."}
{"input": "Vanilla bean lemonade was interesting, but I probably would not do that again. Cheese and cracker plate as an appetizer was very good.   Mac and cheese appetizer had some interesting flavors but seriously needed more moisture.  Lemon artichoke soup was cooked to the point it lost a lot of identity and tasted like a vegetable soup. Those that like a great lemon Greek style soup, this isn't it. Chunky avacado salad was light and excellent. My favorite thing I ate. Crab cake had good lump crab, but a bit too much breading. Chicken salad was good without being remarkable. The live jazz was a nice touch. Overall, pretty good.  Flavors were pretty deep and developed everywhere except in the soup. I'll try something here again."}
{"input": "Sad about updating this review. It has nothing to do with the food, or the service. The food is still great, and the service staff is great too. It has to with the shady business practices of this establishment. We come to this restaurant on a regular basis. My issue is, lately every time we come here they try to price gouge us. Most times when I order a certain menu item, they charge me the lunch price because I order a smaller portion. Depending on the day and the server, the price changes every time. Most recently I ordered only a child's cheese quesadilla, nothing else. I was charged full price for an entire kids meal. I was told when I questioned it that the \"manager\" made him charge me that way. Also on a separate occasion we were way overcharged for margaritas. This issue is now happening so frequently, that I refuse to return. Great job management, trying to get a couple more bucks just lost you loyal customers that frequent your establishment and also recommended it to friends. No more!"}

It's lunch time, you're located downtown, it's your busiest time.  How many waiters do you staff?  If  you answered \"one\", please stop.  I know times are tough but waiting 45 minutes for 4 cubes of chicken in combination with some rice is not appropriate, especially at lunch time.  \n\nThis one was especially bad.  He wasn't lazy but just awkward.  And he did all the food at one time, seemingly.  \n\nThe food was delicious but I barely remember it as I was suffering from \"foodsanity\" where I was waiting so long that I forgot why I had come there in the first place."}
{"input": "Can't beat the price I love it and the girls who watch my child while I work out do an amazing job. My little one is always excited to see them! They have everything you need. The staff is friendly. They greet you with a warm smiles right when you walk in the door. Non judgmental, there are all shapes and sizes all there to love a healthy lifestyle. The only down fall I would say is the women's room doesn't have a sauna like the other location. But if you sweat hard enough I guess you don't need it. Also, just added cycling classes."}
{"input": "Super Sunday Brunch \n\nSuch a great place for Sunday brunch. Split the cinnamon roll to start. So light and airy. \n\nThe Biscuits and Debris is a great Cajun twist on Eggs Benedict. The corn bread biscuits are deliciously addictive. The corn beef hash is unexpected light. Served with the perfect balance of sweet potato, braised cabbage and pickled green beans, it is the perfect breakfast bite. \n\nMake a reservation. You won't be disappointed."}
{"input": "Seriously one of the most pleasant dining experiences I have had in a while. Smiley himself is a true gem and the food was DELICIOUS. Had so much that I am eating it for lunch again today - and I can't wait! Please recommend to everyone you know in Manayunk, don't want to lose this place!"}
{"input": "It's a salad place like saladworks. Lettuce had thick stems, chickpea hot topping wasn't too flavorful."}
{"input": "Cesar did a fantastic job cleaning our carpets! They looked great afterwards and he was nice enough to send me before and after photos which is a great touch. He was also very prompt, friendly, and responsive. I would definitely recommend him in the future!"}
{"input": "simply the best! everything from here is good! I come from a very Italian family and whenever there is a family event, there is always Termini brothers dessert trays! Their cannolis are amazing! Highly recommend."}
{"input": "I wasn't sure what to expect when I first walked into Bevan's last weekend for quick lunch takeout while we were renovating our house, but I was pretty impressed. The woman at the front could not speak perfect english, but she was very helpful nonetheless. I am gluten free, which posed a bit of an issue at a deli, but we worked around it. My boyfriend was happy with his turkey and cheese and I got a cheesesteak with no bun, which was very good. They also appear to have great lunch specials that I'll keep in mind when I'm working from home in the future. \n\nWhat I didn't know about Bevan's is that they are also a little grocery store as well - carrying food, paper goods, even toys for kids! This was very good to know.\n\nFinally, they accept credit cards ($10 min) which was a big help."}
{"input": "They have a very good selection of about 14 Micro Brews on tap.  Most of which are from the local area.  Reduced prices during happy hour.  They also have a large selection of Micro Brew bottles on hand.  I go their for the beer.  I have eaten their \"all you can eat mussels\" on a Monday.  They were very good.  Lots of sausage and decent spice.  The bartenders can be hit of miss.  The guy is friendly and helpful.  The girl is not.  Perpetual PMS.  I thought she was a man hater, but I have heard other women complain also."}
{"input": "I've eaten at many Indian places.  This one is very good!!!  I felt extremely guilty, and very happy with the lunch buffet.  It was wonderful.  Their vegetable dishes, were top notch and the Chicken Tikka Masala was some of the best I've ever had.  Also would give high marks for the Onion Chutney and Palak Paneer.  I'd eat here often if I was local."}
{"input": "I do like this place. The employees are relaxed and friendly, the pizza and salads are good, and the price is fair.  Also, good location for me."}
{"input": "Sorry fellas, this place closed. \n\nIt is set to be replaced with a Stadium Bar & Grill. It's a shame because I actually liked this place. It wasn't much to look at, but the food was decent and the prices were reasonable."}
{"input": "I wish I could offer 3.5 stars but I cannot and 4 would be too many.\n\nMy date and I tried 5 items so I'll rate them all--salad was great, with a tart/sweet dressing in just the right amount.  The shrimp remoulade was good with plentiful fresh shrimp, but alas, was too salty.  The vegetarian entree was a bit odd and the items didn't have an apparent connection to one another.  I only enjoyed a couple of them.  The star of the night was the duck entree enjoyed by my date--wonderful sauce, crispy skin and perfectly prepared.  The bread pudding was saved from average by a wonderful praline topping that we both enjoyed immensely. \n\nAll in all, I\"d go back simply due to the beautiful surroundings and service.  The prices are also quite reasonable for the quality of the food"}
{"input": "Nice place, some poor employees. Feel bad for the way their customers are treated. Being in the business, would never want any customer to experience the nasty attitude of this bartender."}
{"input": "This place is pretty good compared to others in Reno. The gas station might put it off but if you know what you're ordering, it's great. I try to stay away from the spring rolls just cause sometimes it's not that fresh, but as for the pho and a few other things, it's quick and good."}
{"input": "A friend of mine took me to this little jewel near Dale Mabry and it was a great time. Its a small place with under 12 tables and a sushi bar. The bar seems to be the place to sit for the entertainment value. The sushi chefs (and owner) are pretty chatty and always say hi to everyone that comes in. It has a very friendly feel. We ended up at a table because the bar was full. I had pretty average fare in a spicy tuna roll and a rainbow roll, a couple pieces of yellow tail, and 2 pieces of Wahoo. It was all done very well! Super fresh and tasty. The sticky rice wasnt all that sticky and I ended up with a bowl fill of soy sauce and rice by the end of it, but that Wahoo...whoa....that Wahoo!! Just try it and you wont be disappointed. I spent about $30 for dinner which was a fine price for what I got and I will certainly be back for more!"}
{"input": "When I used to live in Philly and did not have a lot of money I went to this Indian restaurant, its cheap and you get a lot of food. While the quantity is great, it lacks quality, there are much better Indian restaurants in Philly this is not one of them. You get what you pay for, there used to be 2 other buffet Indian restaurants near this one."}
{"input": "Park is beautiful.  Plenty to do at this park including tennis, racquetball, handball and more.  You can even rent equipment at Lanai Coffee right next to tennis courts.  There are bathrooms located behind tennis courts as well as next to the playground.  \n\nIf hungry or thirsty while at park you have multiple choices of delicious snacks and drinks at Lanai Coffee as well."}
{"input": "tried them again after several months of staying away. their food graduated a few degrees to just above lukewarm. i will upgrade one star for that alone, BUT, the value has stayed the same as theyve apparently raised their prices. perhaps to make up for all the business their cold food lost them? i would only go back if i were desperate; the foods not worth what they charge."}
{"input": "Recently went to Make Up For Ever at KOP. Initially had a great experience and bought $75 worth of products. After trying them for 5 days I didn't really like them. I went to return and was told I couldn't because they were opened. Thankfully they let me exchange but I ended up having to shove more money out! Then they stamped a big FINAL SALE on my new receipt. Overall, still not in love with the products and definitely won't be buying from there again.\n\nThe Sephora in KOP sells the same Make Up For Ever products and their return policy is unopened or gently used can be returned, so I'll just keep shopping there."}
{"input": "Great food and selection of beer! Also, is great alternative for gluten free restaurant."}
{"input": "Blew $80 on food for the family was worth it food was hot and orange chicken best I've tasted in a awhile..now it will be the place we get Asian food!!"}
{"input": "Worst nail salon experience ever. The guy said \"what is wrong with you\" to a customer who accidentally chipped her nail. When I was explaining how I wanted my nails filed he told me to do it myself. Really bad job. Everyone was rude and does the job too quickly. You would think after having such bad reviews they would learn.."}
{"input": "I loved loved loved the pizza here. I returned and got their gnocchi and it was amazing as well. Really fresh ingredients nice variety on the menu. Really felt like a small family restaurant in Europe. Best pizza in middle Tennessee."}
{"input": "My computer got hacked and instead of taking it to Apple where they do a blanket sweep for $250 and it takes multiple days, Chris was able to walk me through what had happened.\n\nHe removed all of my files on an external drive and swiped the comp, put them back on and even re-installed Word for me free of charge.\n\nHe then changed all of the settings to make my computer as secure as possible and downloaded his preferred ad-blocker which also blocks ads on YouTube videos, which will be forever awesome. \n\nIt was cheaper, faster, and more hands on and thorough than Apple. Highly recommend his abilities."}
{"input": "This place is by far the best Mexican we' ve had so far in the Nola area. The salsa is delicious and the complimentary bean dip is very good also! We ordered queso and grilled chicken fajitas and we enjoyed it all. The service was excellent!"}
{"input": "I'm a huge panara fan.  I just don't like coming in here around 5pm.  Traffic on Street Rd is terrible."}
{"input": "Service was good.  Ambience good.  Better food can be had elsewhere. Priced too high for taste, quality and quantity."}
{"input": "Great place for breakfast. Homemade corn beef hash and biscuits and gravy. Beautiful setting.  Friendly service. Fair prices.  Just a super place to come for breakfast along the water."}
{"input": "I love this place. The staff is so nice and always helpful when trying to decide from the delicious menu. They let us sample sangria and a tequila wine as well. Their guac is outstanding and will never not order when I'm here. They were rated #24 I believe on the top 100 tacos in the US and for good reason. Unbelievably good."}
{"input": "Way too hyped up.server was too worried about getting closing work done and left her tables waiting forever .also with a kitchen that's open for everyone to see, maybe they shouldn't touch all the food with their bare hands ."}
{"input": "I've only had the wings here but they're pretty good. I just get the house sauce with garlic cheese fries on the side. Great late night spot but I often call before making the trip just to ensure they're open."}
{"input": "Quaint cafe in a hard to miss location on Jefferson St. I am very impressed!! Great menu ( bottomless mimosas would be nice)!! I had the blackened fish and grits. I'm always hesitant to get blackened in fear of charcoal burnt, but this was amazing! Perfectly seasoned. I can't get over the menu.. Wonderful variety. Came about 1230 on Sunday afternoon.. about a 10 minute wait for table for 2. I will\ndefinitely be visiting again!"}
{"input": "This place is terrible! I've been coming here for a few years with my daughters and although they are more stingy with toppings than other salad works - my kids don't mind. Usually most of their toppings get easily transferred to my salad. However today, Alexa who's the shift leader said \"toppings don't transfer\" and even though my daughter didn't get a topping and they don't offer a discount - I can't get her topping on my salad. It's utterly ridiculous to consistently pay $30 for 3 salads every two weeks at this establishment but thanks to Alexa - I won't be coming here EVER AGAIN. THANKS!"}
{"input": "We've been going here for years but over the last 6 months its been a downhill slide. The service has become inept.. Slow and sometimes painful to watch. Management seems to have a problem hiring competent staff or keeping thdm once they are trained. The food is almost always good but not a bargain unless you use a Restaurant.com coupon.\nDecent happy hour drink prices.\nI just wish they could train the staff better."}
{"input": "I used to go here all the time for the lunch special, and it was a great deal. We've been only a few times in the last year because my husband isn't a fan, but I enjoy it. The prices do seem to have gone up a fair bit in recent times, but it's still never a disappointing meal."}
{"input": "Super helpful and professional. I love the 'green' idea and was very impressed by the quality of this company."}
{"input": "Great coffee, great donuts, great place. There was a line the whole time we were there which is a good sign."}
{"input": "Great hotel. Clean. Friendly staff. Great breakfast. Great price and rooms have everything you need. Beds are super comfortable. Quiet area. Definitely would stay here again."}
{"input": "Love their juice double burgers with bacon and cheese.\nTheir new location at la Cumbre Plaza offer even better burgers."}
{"input": "A place just for Mac and Cheese? Yes pl(ch)eeeeseee!  hearing about this place and I automatically knew I had to come and try it out. I really like the food! You get to build your own or select from the premade menu items! Cheesy? meaty options?satisfying?\n\nthe environment is great. The tables face towards the windows so u can look outside. The shop itself is pretty small so there aren't many tables, but that's alright. \n\nFood comes quick and price for Mac and cheese is alright I guess. I think it's a bit much for how much you get (pretty small) and it's not like it's the BEST Mac I've ever tasted though. I was expecting a bit more since this place specializes in Mac and cheese afterall. Still give this place a try though! It's still very delicious"}
{"input": "I used to go here for breakfast often when we lived in Tucson. Now we make a point to go back when we visit and I am always happy with their breakfasts. We've loved everything on the breakfast menu, but my favorite is still the fresh herbs omelette. Service is usually good, even when they're busy. I love how there is indoor and outdoor seating. We have never been for dinner, but I have had lunch there (beautiful salad!). A terrific locally-owned restaurant!"}
{"input": "Please  be careful when you order food to go from this restaurant. Their website is not updated and their  employee's  conveniently forget to provide  that information to customers when they take out orders over the phone. I learned of the difference between what I ordered via their website and what I actually  got, when I arrived home. When I called back to the restaurant  inquire about my order, then I was informed \"sorry our website is out dated\" and further told  that what I received was the new version. Smaller in quantity and more expensive in price. So,  if you plan to order anything  to go please learn from me \"their  website is outdated\" and whenever you think you are ordering has been  changed to something slightly different and more expensive. That said, usually the food is OK."}
{"input": "We stopped here on our way through town and want sure what to expect but we were pleasantly surprised. The service sucked and the staff was rude but the food made up that in the end. We had some pulled pork which was more chopped then pulled, brisket tacos which were define, and pulled chicken which was moist. The sides were pretty good too but nothing to write home about. There were five of us and our bill was close to $60 and one meal was a kids meal. I  really only have two complaints: One, they didn't have ribs for lunch and two, the bathrooms were filthy."}
{"input": "As good quality sushi/sashimi you can have anywhere, save maybe Maui & Japan. Right by my corporate office in Wilmington, DE. (Via the lovely River Walk), in a market of sorts. Love this concept. AND THE PORTIONS!!! Normally you get a thin 2\" length at the most, piece of fish on your nigiri. Same with slices of sashimi. Here, you get a generously sliced, 3-4\" portion! In addition, the spicy yellowtail, cone-shaped hand roll I got was nearly the size of my forearm. (Ok, I jest, but it was a monster)!\nI also ordered some great octopus sashimi, mackerel nigiri, & white tuna nigiri. Very good lunch!"}
{"input": "The food and pricing was fine. However, there was a picture of Trump and a positive article about him taped to the wall. I don't go to restaurants with a political view."}
{"input": "I went here with a friend to kill some time before seeing a movie next door.  The atmosphere is cozy, and indie rather than corporate looking.  I got a mug of hot chocolate (standard size) and picked up a chocolate bar from the counter display for later.  There was no price on the chocolate bar or the display, but the total for these two things came out to around $12.  Whatever the breakdown was, at least one of these items was vastly overpriced.  They were good, though, so that earns the place an extra star.  One of the other reviews mentioned that high-schoolers hang out here.  They must have some good part-time jobs."}
{"input": "We went back for the same reason as in 2011 - we thought this was a different Italian Restaurant. Again, we were pleasantly surprised - the food and the service was great!"}
{"input": "Berry Sweet just opened today, August 21, 2010. The folks behind it seem nice enough, and the place really looks like every frozen yogurt place you've ever been to. I think they want to just jump on the \"let's make a lot of money by selling something everyone already loves\" bandwagon; however, isn't that what makes America so great? \n\nLeaving that aside, the place was just recently renovated so it's bright and beautifully clean, kind of like a Phileo knock off (and since they're a pinkberry knock off, see the trend), but its aesthetically appealing and closer to my apartment, so far be it for me to be too critical... well, I probably still will.\n\nMy 2 complaints:\n1- I think it's actually ice cream they are serving today. so they need to look up what is actually frozen yogurt because YES there is a differnent\n2- toppings = seriously lacking. \n\nHowever, again- living across the street from it, I'll give it another try, and we'll see how that pans out."}
{"input": "My husband and I went here for our anniversary dinner.  I had never tried this type of food and it was delicious!  Super high quality and amazing taste.  The bread was soooo good.  I can't wait to go back again."}
{"input": "Without a doubt one of the best meals I've ever had!  And the owners, Chris and Michelle are the most gracious hosts anyone could ask for!   The menu was outstanding, the soup and I'm a soup junkie, is the best I've had.   The filet was one of the best I've ever enjoyed!   If you have the opportunity to get a table here, you will find that your every expectation will be exceeded!"}
{"input": "Horrible service!  There for an hour and a half and never got food. Six tables seated after us got fed and left. Our server said he didn't know what happened. When I asked to speak to the manager I was told he was cooking in the kitchen. We finally walked out."}
{"input": "Yet another fine hipster coffee shop in Reno! I am telling you kids Reno is the new Portland. They have all the choices you would expect from a third wave coffee shop, beautiful fully manual espresso machines that are intregrated into the counter and are droll worthy in their beauty and function. Chemex and V60 for pour over fans and freaks, a selection of teas that is decent and some really gross versions of \"cronuts\". They also have some blends and concoctions that are good for the fans of the sugary bombs of Starbucks and that ilk.\n\nThe space is pure hipster, simple clean, subway tile and wood, just a handful of tables inside and out and they have free wifi and clean bathrooms. \n\nBaristas are way friendlier than the surly folks in SF and the west coast and the prices are cheaper too than in the usual hipster towns."}
{"input": "Finally had the chance to stop by Bab Cafe...what took us so long!  Both of us being Asian food fanatics, we are so happy to have Bab Cafe part of our ever expanding culinary experience here in Reno.\n\nWith the guidance of the very friendly and knowledgeable staff, we quickly got a hang of what to order, though there will be many more choices on our future visits.  Liking things a little spicy, we both ordered the Jeyuk Top-Bab (spicy pork).  What incredible flavor!  There is nothing that compares to this place in Reno.  The sauce bar gives you the opportunity to mix things up and the included miso soup is a definite bonus.  Great value for such a fresh, enjoyable meal.  Convenient downtown location to take away, dine in or have it delivered via UberEats."}
{"input": "I have used Wurster's for a couple of repairs to my wife's BMW.  Each repair was over 30% less than the dealership quote.  The facility is not plush, but you keep the savings from their low overhead.  They seem very honest about what your car needs."}
{"input": "Definitely my last resort when it comes to movie theaters in the area.  They're always the most expensive around and it's not even like you're getting something special (i.e. lounge chairs) with the extra cost.  The bathrooms are always really messy and most times there is some kind of disturbance during the movie.  The one good thing is they almost always have a time that you can make, which is why it's always my last resort.  There's also a T.G.I. Friday next door if you want to do dinner and a movie.  Check other theaters before this one!"}
{"input": "This place earned the large crowds it has. The ice cream is amazing! So smooth and flavorful. The raspberry sherbet is the best sherbet I've had. The brownies were so rich and wonderful. I don't think I can describe how amazing this place is. Just try to avoid around dinner on the weekends, parking is impossible to find."}
{"input": "Tria's employees are very knowledgeable about the selection of beers and wines they offer. This is probably why I look forward to going to Tria. This location has outside seating during the warmer months and is a real treat if you can get a table out there. It always seems to be busy, which is a good thing. I've never had any of the food items at Tria, because the real treat here are the drinks."}
{"input": "Best wonton mee soup!! The only con is they don't give you your change back, they automatically assume your going to give them all your change. I just think they should ask if you want change back. Other than that everything is great the food is great the atmosphere is great!"}
{"input": "I have now tried this salon three times.  The first visit was on Mother's day.  Even though it was pretty crowded they moved through the waist list quickly.  I was a little surprised to be offered a drink, but quickly noticed that this must be a big selling point for them as most women were sipping on adult beverages.  I declined refreshments and was promptly handed info on more expensive options for my pedi.  Unlike other places in other states I had gone they did not do the massage of my calves with lotion or use the hot towel on my legs.  As soon as you go to the dry station they hound you for immidate payment.  The last time I went was the last straw.  They are already $5 more than the other salons for a basic pedi, but apparently I chose a color of polish that costs $5 more than the others making my 20 minute pedi $30 before tip.  The polish was not smooth started chipping in 2 days.  I will not return."}
{"input": "Interesting find on the west side. For some reason it was really humid in there but food was great. Buffet was clean and good!  Even brought us our own basket of naan to our table!!!"}
{"input": "This place rules.  Anywhere that you can get a shot of booze in your hot chocolate is a winner for me.\n\nThe coconut ice cream I have had in the past has tasted more like vanilla ice cream with coconut flavoring; this was not the case here.  Chock full of coconut, it was some of the best ice cream I have ever had.  The whipped cream was dense and delicious, and along with the hot fudge, this place put forth one of the best ice cream experiences to date.\n\nThe decor doesnt feel like your run of the mill diner, and was excellent.\n\nI would like to go back here sometime and grab something to eat, but I will certainly be making it something small so I can end big with another sundae!"}
{"input": "I have groen up eating Italian food and i have not come across a more legit place than Mazzaros! Love their sauce and meatballs."}
{"input": "Fantastic dentist!! Dr. Jaffari & team treat you like a person, not just a patient but are so comprehensive in their treatment. Cannot speak highly enough."}
{"input": "Solid. Really enjoyed. Great food. Great ingredients. Great vibe (and service). Would definitely come back if in the area."}
{"input": "We stopped in here for lunch today and it did not disappoint. Our server was very informative and very welcoming! Our group ordered a mix of things.. some of our favorites were the fried green tomato but (she added the egg and cheese) , the homemade chicken salad sandwich (I ordered this and honestly, the best chicken salad I have ever had. Everything just worked so well together! Great flavor!!), also the blackberry cobbler. The dessert just felt like home. Pure comfort food! We loved the vibe here and it was precious inside! Thanks for the great experience!"}
{"input": "As soon as my boyfriend landed in New Orleans to meet me for our vacation we had one mission - find a restaurant with happy hour and buck-a-shuck oysters.  Luke happened to be close by (we stayed at Le Pavillon Hotel), had a happy hour, and had oysters, so we headed that way.  Found out when we got that that happy hour included $.50 oysters.  SCORE!\n\nLuke is a great restaurant with cool decor.  The food was absolutely fantastic, the drinks were spot on and worth every penny (especially during happy hour), and the service was fantastic.  Highly recommended!"}
{"input": "I want to like this place since it's right around the corner from me, but it's just less than mediocre sushi and way overpriced. The rolls are undersized and the fish is not very fresh. Good location, bad sushi, worse prices."}
{"input": "Small Japanese sushi/hibachi restaurant that seems to always be busy, even on a Thursday night! We had a group of 7 and were lucky that we were able to be seated together without a reservation. The menu is extensive and has some definite traditional favorites, but also some variations and different dishes as well. The presentation on every dish is on point.\n\nI had the coconut milk, fried calamari, and baked Philly roll. Lots of food at a good price and I left feeling stuffed. There's a lot of vegetarian options here, including tofu teriyaki and a pumpkin roll.  Between the 7 of us, we tried 5 of the desserts as well. Everything was delicious. They also offer a gluten-free soy sauce!"}
{"input": "Very cute, reminds me of a Trader Joe's. They have the best smoothies! I recommend the Pineapple Express."}
{"input": "I stopped in for lunch and everything was very good.\nI realy like the road kill very good with mushrooms an\n\nd onions smothered with melted cheese. Good job."}
{"input": "Despite being a spin-off at the burgers from Rouge, I actually think that the burgers here are, dare I say it, better then flagship restaurants.\nOver the last year they keep expanding their burger and toppings options by editing the little placard next to the registers, instead of changing their giant menuboard every time  they decide to add a new cheese or vegetable you can put on the burger.\n\nI've been here a few times, trying the 500 (lettuce, bacon, cheddar, special sauce) delicious, and also making my own combos with their Kobe Beef burger (I think its worth the extra few bucks). I like it with truffle cheese and grilled onions. The brioche bun also really makes these burgers something special.\n\nTheir fries are also extremely delicious. As a huge fan of truffle oil, I can never resist getting their truffle oil fries. When they come warm out of the fryer, coated in truffle oil, there is just no better taste known to man.\n\nMost important of all, they are open late on weekends."}
{"input": "Best cupcakes I've had in Indy!!  Nice to find a place that uses fresh indgrediants.  Incredible taste!"}
{"input": "Had a last minute request to find a special rye whiskey (High West double rye) as a present in New Orleans, but didn't have a car (or time) to travel far to find it. This place had it in stock and at reasonable price. Very convenient location in French Quarter."}
{"input": "I wish I could say it was not an incredibly unpleasant experience. She was very loud and very rude."}
{"input": "Decided to give this place a try on my lunch break and I have to say...I'm impressed. It's a little small but the decorations are pleasant l. Most importantly, the sushi is VERY good...and you get a good amount. \n\nI will definitely be going back."}
{"input": "Ordered their chicken fajita and fish chips. \nChicken was really good, fish and chips not so much. Portions sizes were too little, for the price I would expect a little more. Drinks were alright."}
{"input": "We had the Crazy Old Goat and Turkey Presto with a side of mac & cheese. The sandwiches were very good and we can't wait to try others. The mac & cheese was good but nothing out of the ordinary. Definitely recommend!"}
{"input": "Perfect little homey one owner restaurant .  Staff members are so attentive and knowledgeable. Good food, reasonable priced, and very fresh!"}
{"input": "I was in the mood for a quick bite at McDonald's.\nI thought this was the place to go. I went to this McDonald's and got me a nice big Mac, fries and a soda, cost me about nine bucks. No biggie but I told the manager specifically, I wanted hot fries from the fryer.  But she served me cold fries that's been sitting out for at least 10 minutes. I complained but she was mean and rude. All I wanted was hot fries. Is that too much to ask at a McDonald's? She refuse to give me the hot fries and argued with me that the fries were hot. Really?"}
{"input": "I wish there was more seating but what're you gonna do! Haha\n\nFriendly staff, and huge portions.\n\nSo yummy! Love the scrambles and burritos. The French toast was amazing for real too!"}
{"input": "This is my FAVORITE place to eat. They have the BEST breakfast, lunch, and dinner choices. Over the past 7 years, everything I have had has always been delicious. The owner went to a prestigious restaurant school and he is superb at putting specials together using the local fresh farmer's produce. Also, I found my favorite winery through The Blue Plate."}
{"input": "Great little spot for having done local beers. It's a bit small. Not some place I'd go extremely often but good to mark off the list. Nothing super unique but they know what they are and they do it well. Very nice staff."}
{"input": "I am only giving 5 stars because the Shamrock Shake is back and delicious!! Too bad it's around only once a year ;("}
{"input": "Delicious coffee and espresso drinks and a cute little cafe. If you come during the morning rush hour, be prepared to wait a while for your drink. There are a decent number of seats here, but again, if you come in the morning, you might feel a little uncomfortable with the people in line crowding your space. I am a big coffee drinker, so I like that their refills are 75 cents, if I remember correctly. The baristas are also very friendly.\n\nMy major problem with La Columbe is their lack of wifi. It's the 21st century, guys! It's a good place to hang out for a few hours with a friend or do some non-computer-requiring work, but the lack of wifi is seriously limiting."}
{"input": "Great waffles & chicken!! As good or better than Roscoe's! I found the service to be great! Coming back for the live music!"}
{"input": "beware of this hotel!!!!! they just approved a policy of charging customers $50 a night for incidentals!!! if you stay for 5 days thats $250 just for incidentals on top of your nightly charge for your stay! are you kidding me!!!! oh yea, if you don't have a credit card  it's double that, yes $100 a night for incidentals!!!!!!! finally, they don't tell you this till you get there at check-in!!!   \n\nps. yes that includes all you cogic people there for the convention!!!"}
{"input": "Outstanding! They have great gluten-free and vegan options too. The salad, pizza, and root beer were just perfect."}
{"input": "St. Cecilia is a lovely, intimate space with excellent food and great service.  They also make a good Sazerac, which I've learned is mandatory to be considered fine dining in NOLA.  \n\nOur party of two had two  appetizers, grilled oysters and confit wings.  Both were great.  For our entree, we split the gnocchi, which was about as good as gnocchi gets, and the reason you should visit St. Cecilia.\n\nWe drank our dessert - Sazerac, again, and went on our merry way, feeling pleasantly mellow and satisfied."}
{"input": "This place is Smokey and insane...8 dollars for a drink at center bar , even if your playing the bar-top machines?? I know its not Vegas but come on, some tickets/vouchers I had from a month ago with money on the expired?? Why is that?? Even the stupid slots would not take em?? I had to go to meet a friend who spends a lot there, I was coughing my brains out from the smoke. I was stressed the whole time I was there,  as was my wife, it used to be fun, now it sucks.We eat at some of the restaurants weekly , but we are done. Now they want to re-do the lot and charge to park , what the hell is wrong with these greedy Indians or whoever is running this scam.Talk about driving people away, I know they don't care because its always packed house, the clientèle however has dropped to thugs and lowlifes. The parking garage is nasty like New Jersey...garbage all over,  stinks, gum on the ground, just shit. Now should I tell you what I really think??"}
{"input": "Excellent shrimp and grits for breakfast! A nice spicy barbecue taste to it. My husband had the Boudin omelette and it was good but the boudin wasn't crisp and was  and he thinks that would've been better, but the hashbrowns were phenomenal."}
{"input": "Ribeye was amazing!!!   60 day dry aged. One of the best I've ever had!!! Shrimp cocktail was good, but I don't understand all the love? Service was great! Bacon was kick ass! I liked the whole experience!! So did the whole family!"}
{"input": "Just OK fried southern basics. The fried chicken was pretty good, Mac and cheese was reheated and not very creamy, collard greens were passable. Fried shrimp were good, but that'd be just sad to mess that up. I wouldn't go back for dinner but would definitely stop by the storefront to pick up some pralines."}
{"input": "My husband and I have dined at Ryan Christopher's on several different occasions. Every time we leave, we're stuffed and more importantly satisfied. \n\nAlthough we've never dined here for dinner the breakfast and lunch options are great. They have something for everyone from waffle egg sandwiches, chocolate chip pancakes, to poached pear salads and Thai chicken wraps. Everything we've tried has been tasty.  \n\nThe restaurant has expanded their seating area. They removed the bar/ griddle area and have introduced a larger seating area. In the warmer months you can done outside. \n\nI'm giving it a 4 because the service, although friendly, is not always attentive."}
{"input": "I was trying to find a decent place for dinner tonight for my moderately health conscious self when I came across this place. After figuring out what I wanted and put the Be My Bison burger in my cart for the online order, I realized it would be over a two mile round trip excursion from my job. Defeated, I started to search elsewhere but I could not get that burger off of my mind. I came back a few hours later and submit my order. I hiked it there and it just came out of the kitchen as I walked in.  I grabbed my burger and continued on my way back to work. O-M-G! Absolutely in love with this place. It has been quite the task to try and find healthy places that fit my diet but this is a dream come true! Thank You!"}
{"input": "Okay maybe the word awesome is overused but that is how I would describe Tobey's Junk Hauling service. He communicates well, shows up on time, and takes care of business for a reasonable price. Awesome."}
{"input": "I eat here everytime I'm in New Orleans and always recommend it to friends. I can't vouch for their more lunch-y items but their brunch/breakfast stuff is AMAZING. The biscuits and gravy are one of my favorite items to get. The omelettes are so tasty and make me like boring omelettes again. Lots of condiments on the table (always a plus for me) and the service is always pretty good. Only cons (for some people, not really for me) are that its relatively small and theres always a wait on the weekends but never more than 25 minutes."}
{"input": "It was easy to work with Preferred Party Rentals for a June graduation party. We browsed their inventory online and placed an online request for quote on the items we were interested in  (tent, tables, chairs, linens, etc.). Then we talked with them on the phone and tweaked the order (they suggested different size tablecloths, etc.). The delivery crew coordinated well with us and quickly set up the tent. Everything was easy; we will absolutely use them again for our next party."}
{"input": "This was my second time going \nFirst time service was very slow,\nBecause it's new ,I let that pass\n2nd time 11/30/14 \nThere was hair in our food and not one but 4 plates\nInexcusable !!!\nI will not return"}
{"input": "I've had this steakhouse on my list for a while now, due to the fact that I love steak, it's run by Croatians, and there are intimate booths with curtains. However, it took a while for my fiancée and I to make it over there due to the shady neighborhood. We were pleasantly surprised that there was a parking lot adjacent to the building and security guard standing outside the door. We were greeted right away and brought to our private booth. We had an older gentleman as our waiter, who I felt looked down upon us for our age, even though my fiancée and I are 25 and both have respectable professions. Aside from him, everything was great. We ordered the shrimp cocktail, although small was delicious. I had the filet and the German potatoes which were fantastic, and my picky fiancée had the potatoes lyonnaise with a sirloin, that he stated was the best steak he's ever had. We will definitely be back for special occasions!"}
{"input": "I am giving this bar four stars because not only is it my go to bar most nights, but also because of all the BS the bartenders and workers put up with there. The drinks here are not bad, average priced, however some nights they are a bit watered down. Overall its a good bar, if you are a fan of REALLY loud music, go on the weekends, if you are not a fan, like me, stick to weekdays. Also stay away from the bathrooms, they are a wreck. Overall though, good service and nice bartenders !"}
{"input": "I consistently have an EXCELLENT experience here. Last month, I had their take out 3 nights in a row and still enjoyed it. I frequent there at least weekly. A few must try's are the General Tso's chicken, the Mongolian beef, and Vegetable Delight. It's the 'go-to' place for my roommate and I. Affordable prices, especially for the quality and amount of food. \n\nI've dined in a few times and the ambience is nice. Contemporary art work on the walls and classical music playing. Do yourself a favor and try it out. You will not regret it!"}
{"input": "I ordered mix veggie pizza and it was fantastic.  Veggies were flavorful and the crust was thin and delicious.  Highly recommend!"}
{"input": "First time paddleboarding. 3 women from the East Coast..so we were nervous. We were newbies to paddleboarding.\n\nGrant was our instructor and he was amazing and patient and has the best Aussie accent (it's real too!). We had great instruction on the ground and safety instruction before hitting the water. We did really well and owe it all to Grant and his individual attention and not pushing us beyond our capabilities. We ventured farther out to sea where the waters were a little bumpy and we were just determined to stay standing. 2 of us fell numerous times but had the best time. Grant brought lunch from Trader Joe's. yum. we loved it. We woud recommend this company and Grant to everyone; in fact, we already have shared it with others."}
{"input": "This place is disappointing for a 4.5 star rating. The burgers were so-so. The vibe felt very much like a chain restaurant like Red Robin. We did go on a Tuesday night so perhaps it's better on the weekends? Either way, we won't be back."}
{"input": "Had graduation dinner for 21 the other night. Everyone enjoyed the food greatly. Dinner,drinks and desserts were awesome! Thank you for a wonderful experience!"}
{"input": "I never had Mongolian BBQ before till i came to this spot. I loved it . You walk up and fill your bowl with as much stuff as you want, meat and all and then you hand it to the chef and let him do his magic. Their sesame bread is sooo good I always get an extra piece. \" A Must Try\""}
{"input": "Salad was good.  Pizza is not good!  Boring, tasteless and just unsatisfying.  Very disappointed.  Also on a chilly night it is a cold interior.  This was my third try there.  Won't go back"}
{"input": "The room we had was huge.  It was a non smoking two queens.  Very roomy in the general area.  Bathroom very small and old.  Smoke from the hall way made it in.  Very bad.  Price was very good.  It served what we needed.  Place is part of Peppermill so decor is kind of dark.  If u need a place to sleep, good price and location, this is it.  For a cheesy place I was very surprised that it was somewhat quiet.  Maybe due to all the elderly here.  Didn't see a lot of kids.  Good thing."}
{"input": "Peter piper on roids. Good pizza"}
{"input": "This is a fantastic place to get meats and other groceries.  A little on the pricey side but you getting better quality in most of the items.  The only drawback to Mazzaro's is the parking.  \n\nIf you go on the weekend expect a crowd!"}
{"input": "Excited to try this new, nice looking burger place in town and finally got a chance eat there - very disappointed. It's it set up as a fast food restaurant, but they charge like a high end operation. Missed the mark by a mile. The burger was expensive, side were severely overpriced. Fries were boring, ordinary and weren't very fresh. The bright spots would be the fried zucchini and the ghost pepper cheese. I will stop at Red Robin next time for better service, better food and better value."}
{"input": "Needs Work! Start by putting a sign up... Where are we? Where is the restroom? This menu is confusing! \nThe bartender was awesome, very well informed and made great recommendations. \nWe were excited for our food... Great presentation but both of our dishes were bland and lacked flavor... I thought this was mexican! I'd give one star for the food/ restaurant but five to the bar tender... we'll try again in a year."}
{"input": "I love Vedge and was really looking forward to Wiz Kid for vegan take-out in my neighborhood. Huge disappointment!  Very few healthy options! (Note: see all the reviews about the fries,). It may be tasty but I can't say because, as a healthy vegetarian, there was nothing appealing for me to order. I stopped in on several different occasions in the hope of finding some additional menu options, but no luck at all. Really too bad!"}
{"input": "Let me start by saying I'm from philadelphia so I've never had shrimp & grits together! It was AMAZINGGGGG. The food came out quickly and our waitress was a sweetie. Definitely worth the walk from the French quarter."}
{"input": "Best oysters I've ever had, hands down. Excellent service and great happy hour selection. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"input": "This place is wonderful! My fiance and I had the lunch \"buffet\" today.  It's not a buffet as far as the set up. You don't go get your own food. It is brought out to you. They sit you down with a good sized menu, and you get to order whatever you want, as much as you want. They prefer if you start out with an appetizer or something, because the sushi is made to order, and depending on how busy it is (every table was occupied at noon today), you'll have a bit of a wait for it. The lunch was $9.99 per person. I don't know how you can possibly beat that! I did not care for the ginger dressing on my salad. It tasted quite bitter to me. I also didn't really care for my tempura banana. It was more of a texture thing for me. Once a banana gets heated up, it gets very mushy. Everything else was delicious. Items we ordered include shrimp shumai, gyoza, clear soup, house salad, edamame, tempura banana, Fuji roll, Hawaii roll, California roll, Alaskan roll, Philadelphia roll, and Green Sarabay roll."}
{"input": "The food is awesome! There is a drive through and it's open late. This place is perfect for late night cravings."}
{"input": "I had the pleasure of dining in this rustic setting after years of hearing about its charm. The setting & the excellent cuisine did not disappoint! I had the New York steak & my friends had a variety of other entrees & we were all pleased with the quality of our choices! I hear that weekends with music make this place great fun! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"input": "I absolutely love Sprinkles cupcakes. In my opinion, the cupcakes are perfectly moist and every cupcake I have had so far has been extremely satisfying.\nMy personal favorite is German Chocolate cake.\nThis location is fairly small so it looks like there is a bigger line than there actually is.\n\nOh, check out there rewards program it pretty awesome it got me a free cupcake when I signed up!"}
{"input": "A restaurant worth visiting! This place offers exceptional service and a delicious menu! The staff are class acts and the venue is beautiful. Well done and thank you for making my dining experience such a great one!"}
{"input": "Customer service here is lacking. We stood there watching an employee restock the ice cream bins for a good while until he decided/realized that we wanted some. Customers should be a priority in my opinion."}
{"input": "All I can say is WOW! The clam chowder is the best I've tasted in Nashville! The chicken salad is delicious and the cupcake was wonderful! I will definitely be going back!!!"}
{"input": "I think drinks are watered down at every night club you go. That is to be expected I guess, unfortunate so might I suggest going to a dive bar and having a few? Little nugget hooks it up haha. Anywho, I like the music they play here most times. It gets a little crowded, but if you throw some elbows it'll get the herd moving a long. I like that they don't have go go dancers, I think that's semi trashy, like next step to a strip club trashy. Then again this is Reno so that's to be expected too."}
{"input": "I would not advise staying at this hotel. I called to speak to a manager after my friend put the post below and the manager was once again, very rude."}
{"input": "These guys rock! I originally try to book with aqua sports, but they were booked solid. They referred me to Santa Barbara Adventure Company and I could not have been more satisfied. Our guide Adam was professional and extraordinarily informative. You could tell he had a real passion for his job and shared his knowledge of the history of the island and its local inhabitants. I seriously considered bringing my own kayak and going it alone but I'm so glad I didn't. I went in areas that I never would have considered, but never felt forced to do so. Our group had approximately's five kayaks and all of us were novices. I consider myself an intermediate just because I'd been in kayaks before but after the trip I realized how much I really didn't know! Adam was very patient and never forced anyone to do anything they weren't comfortable doing, and I never felt rushed. These guys deserve six stars. I give Santa Barbara Adventure Company my highest rating!"}
{"input": "My wife and I were running some errands in Sparks, and at our last stop, found our car's battery was dead! We are AAA members, so we called and they told me All Points was the towing company that would respond to our situation. I didn't get his name, but the driver showed up within 30 minutes, was smiling and friendly. He asked a few questions about the state of our car, then hooked up his jumper cables. The car started right up, and he suggested we go to a nearby Autozone to have them run a diagnostics test to see if the problem was with the alternator or the battery. We did just that, and discovered the battery needed to be replaced. All Points' driver and his suggestion were spot on!  They are on AAA's recommended auto service and towing for a very good reason. They are great, and I'll keep them in mind should my family or friends are in need of a tow or jump start."}
{"input": "Great Mediterranean joint in lil ole Ruskin!! The falafel wraps, schwarma and daily specials are ALWAYS TASTY! Thank you for putting Ruskin on the map with your bangin' eats!!"}
{"input": "So this is a delayed review because I forgot the name of this place, but figured it out via google street view.  I came here the day after the final day of the bar exam.  I was drained in every conceivable way, and had a hangover (thanks, AC) that could only be cured with the best, most gluttonous diner breakfast.  \n\nEverything my gf and I ordered was great.  I got basically every breakfast item on the menu (pancakes, eggs, hash browns, bacon, toast, sausage) and she got the cheesesteak.  Including a basket of great onion rings to start and 20% tip, it was only about $30, which is what I'm used to paying per head for a weekend brunch.  I'm crafting an excuse to travel over the bridge just to get some great homestyle diner food."}
{"input": "This may look like just a hole in the wall food establishment but if you judge on that alone, you'd be missing out. The food here is fantastic from the way it's prepared to the seasoning they use. Amazing gyros, fish and chicken in a variety of ways. Whatever you do, please try some dessert when you go."}
{"input": "Fresh....Greek. Authentic.  There's a reason this place is number one in Tarpon Springs just watch out for dropping olives into the liquid... You willsplash your shirt!  Isn't  that the sign of a good meal is that you wear it on the front of you?"}
{"input": "What a cool place.  Great locally roasted coffee, fresh and delicious baked goods, cat products made by local artisans, and, CATS!  Where else can you have a coffee and snack with a friendly kitten sitting on your lap?  Fall in love with one of the felines?  The cats are all from the SPCA, have their shots and are fully adoptable!"}
{"input": "Tina I believe was our waitress.. I'm not sure if I want to give 3 or 4 stars. Its just that the initial wait was kinda long. But it was my first time eating the food and I thought it was pretty good. I liked my side salad too!"}
{"input": "Over my 68 years, I have eaten a lot of pralines. Some delicious, some not so much. But I can say with absolute certainty, that they make the best praline I have ever had. They aren't cheap, but they are worth every penny. I'm just glad I live 70 miles away, or I would go there all too often!"}
{"input": "Did not care for the food, service was mediocre, and parking was dismal."}
{"input": "Terrible service , love the food from bob Evans but this location really need some improvement in their service. Went in with my family & didn't have a server to offer me a drink or nothing at all, after being seated there for like  10 mins. There was a waitress keep going back in forth the same road but didn't even bother to offer us a drink or nothing. Two servers then came by and said sorry because for there was a misunderstanding about who was  going to serve our table ?? \nReally ? It wasn't even that busy. \n\nFood was good but service very slow."}
{"input": "Best Poker room in Reno. We also stayed at the Hotel and would recommed it."}
{"input": "Just had a very pleasant visit!\n\nVietnamese coffee was bomb!  A bit too sweet for my liking but still delicious and hit the spot!\n\nMoist, flavorful fried chicken sandwich with a nice buttermilk crunchy slaw.  The bread was pillowy and tasty!\n\nFinally, tried the nutella donut which was perfection.\n\nFriendly service, highly recommend!"}
{"input": "Though I'm personally not a huge Bud (or domestic beer for that matter) fan, there's not a lot you can complain about a free informative tour and free beer! And not just any 'ol bud but a variety of specialty beers that you can't find anywhere else. The clydesdales and dalmatians are the best part of the tour! Be sure to stop by their impressive gift shop to pick up some souvenirs.\n\nBottom line, when in Rome, do as the Roman's do, so when in St. Louis, make a stop off at Anheuser-Busch brewery and grab a bud like a good midwesterner ;)"}
{"input": "I have been here many times and it's always hit or miss.  You either get a ton of meat with plenty of sauce on a fresh, soft pita, or the bare minimum of meat and hardly any sauce on a dried-out, crumbly pita.  It's never in between, and there's no pattern or indication of whether it's gonna be good or bad. \nService is always surly, but I'd be surly too if I spent my days waiting on drunken FQ fucktards.\nCash only.  Stop complaining and carry a little cash. (only $7-8 bucks for a gyro.)\n\nAll in all, if you're in doubt I'd say roll the bones and give it a shot.  Because even when they fuck it up it's still pretty good...."}
{"input": "The food here is amazing and our server Geri is one of the best servers I have ever had. The char grilled oysters are a MUST. The reason I gave them 4 stars is because the manager was rude.  Initially we asked if we could move our table so we can see the parade and he responded saying \"really? Just for the parade?\" He had an attitude and made It seem as if our request was bothersome. Geri was great. Loved her."}
{"input": "I had heard great things about Cucina Zapata and tried it this past week for the first time. I tried the Cap'n Crunch Crusted Tilapia Burrito and and the Thai Ice Coffee with Bubbles. The Burrito was really good - I loved the blend of flavors! I enjoyed the Thai Ice Coffee too and appreciated that they have the option to put bubbles in it. The staff was also very friendly. \n\nThe only reason I gave this food truck 4 stars instead of 5 is because the wait to get food can be a little too long. I went here at around 1:30pm and had to wait about half an hour to get my food despite the fact that there were only 4-5 people in front of me in line. Will definitely go back there nonetheless!"}
{"input": "Updated to 5 stars.  They expanded the place with more seating and the food is as good as it was when it was just a tiny hole in the wall.  Craving it now:"}
{"input": "This place is so cute. The interior is adorable and casual. There's some small booths and chairs and tables for hanging out and enjoying your food/drinks. It's all so clean, too, which is a huge plus.\nThere's a little section with baked goods, some Asian and some more American. They have mostly Vietnamese food, but I also saw some other types of food (e.g bulgogi).\nI came in with two friends and the woman who helped us was really personable and friendly. We ordered banh mi and boba tea, and sat down waiting for our food to be brought to us. The banh mi was really yummy, especially the bread. I had boba milk tea, which was as good as any milk tea I've had before. \nThey have a drink card which you can get stamped to receive a free tenth drink. Definitely an incentive to return. Also, their hours are awesome, which is a huge plus."}
{"input": "So far so good. I was taken by Abe the office manager, he was so incredibly kind to me I was amazed. I have an appointment Monday.\n\nUpdate: I was really impressed with the quality of work. Even though they are called Emergency Dentist, they are a full serve. I was most impressed that he thought about this as a long term solution preventing additional work and discomfort later."}
{"input": "Delicious pho, the rare beef in particular is amazing. The best pho I've had in Delco so far."}
{"input": "CycleBar is an amazing cycling studio! \n\nI went a few times during the free trial period and I can't wait to go back. The classes have amazing energy and the instructors I've had have been nothing but energetic and fun. I have to say my favorite classes are the Happy Hours with Chris S.  He's as animated and hilarious as you would want someone kicking your ass before the weekend needs to be. \n\nCycleBar has shoes to make for ride as comfortable as possible, awesome music and tv screens in the studio as well as towels at the ready. Be sure to check the weight of the bar at your bike! Could get ugly when that arm part comes along during your ride! \n\nBe sure to take advantage of the water bottles and snacks available pre or post ride! Could be really helpful to energize your bod before the 50 min ride. \n\nLots of themed rides, promos and events at CycleBar Carmel as well!"}
{"input": "TJ'S had great ambience and views. The food was good but not exceptional...price appropriate for area. Service was somewhat slow.\n\nFor a more complete review, we will need to try their pizza."}
{"input": "Quality sushi for Missouri! Everything was fresh and full of flavor! Sometimes service is a bit slow but still very friendly and I've left my Fitbit there once and they kept it safe for me until I returned :)"}
{"input": "My friend and I split the spinach dip as an app. Dang. As someone who is both stingy and never orders appetizers, this was beyond worth it, folks. Cheesy and warm and all you could ever want. \n\nThe Mellowterranean was super delicious as well. We split a medium size and had to be rolled out we were so stuffed. \n\nGreat waitstaff and service. Homeboy hypnotized us with his eyes.You win, cute waiter. You win."}
{"input": "This place is a treasure! It took me a while to figure out, but now I shop there all the time.\nThe baked goods are amazing - especially the brownies. Never had better brownies than theirs. They've got a lot of the Southern classics here, like CocaCola cake and Chess Pie. My boyfriend loves the ham salad, which I didn't even know existed before we started coming here.\n\nThey've got an excellent produce section with decent prices, and racks of brand name breads/rolls marked down to 79 cents that aren't even close to day-old!!! They've got a lunch counter that has a great menu, the people that run the place are really nice. Forget about Whole Foods and Harris Teeter. Give this place a chance - it really deserves it."}
{"input": "14 layer eggplant was light and tasty. Pure eggplant with tomato sauce and a little bit of cheese. Highly recommended. Their lasagna is supposed to be one of their famous dishes as well, but it is on the heartier side. \n\nAtmosphere is nice. We sat on a chilly night in the room with a fireplace. It was cozy. Also, great location right on the Delaware River. It seems like a more middle aged clientele, it's not really a hot, new restaurant. More of a conservative, nice, laid back place. Myself and my friend were the only people under 45 I'm guessing."}
{"input": "Tasty food. Culver's never disappoints. Everything I've had has been really good- from their food to their cement mixers. I also really like their shakes. Super yummy. Store is always clean and employees are really nice."}
{"input": "Startlingly good! The rotisserie chicken was delightful. Service was a little slow, but it was good-natured, so I can't complain too much, I suppose. I'd definitely go back."}
{"input": "Have been here many times and always had a great experience. When we moved to Rita Ranch 6 months ago my husband and I did a lot of rehab work on our new house and would go almost once a week to recover from the week's \"work-out\". It's always clean, they never gyp you on time, take the time to work on problem areas. Felicia is the best. Highly recommend them! \n\nUpdate...neck really bothering me so I went in and had the best therapeutic massage with Felicia. It was amazing! She is truly talented."}
{"input": "Best breakfast place ever. Their challah french toast was to die for!!! Such a cute place and the servers were all super friendly!"}
{"input": "I like this yogurt shop, though I wish they had just a few more flavors. The toppings are pretty good, though the bananas were obviously not holding up well. Someone should tell them that bananas get gross after a while!\n\nPricing is so-so. I mostly go here because it's super-convenient."}
{"input": "I go here all the time for a quick bite to eat in the city. The food is fresh and there's a big variety. They offer good coffee, sandwiches, breakfast and even have a little grocery store with produce and frozen foods and much more. Super convenient and the staff is always very pleasant with a good sense of humor. They even offer a sandwich happy hour during the week. There is seating available as well"}
{"input": "A local favorite. Worth trying at least once. The staff is usually pretty friendly. Be prepared to wait on a weekend. \n\nThe service is the best thing going. The food selection is pretty large. Diner food with a sprinkle of greek influence. I've found some of the food items to not be so fresh.  It seems like they must use lard or butter on everything because every time I left my stomach just felt extremely heavy for hours.  If you go, plan for a nap and tums after."}
{"input": "We ate here as repeat customers for years, but our last 2 orders were not good. We typically get the same things. The quality, the taste, the texture... It was all not the same and not very good. Things were over cooked, tough texture, greasy, and bland. (and this was the only close Chinese restaurant that wasn't great or bland previously) I've been waiting, hoping others post reviews that things are better, but until I see things improved, it's not worth it for us to try again."}
{"input": "I gave The Mason Jar 3 stars for these reasons: \n\n-They always get to-go orders incorrect. Always. \n-The front of the house staff is not welcoming. They are sort of dreary. \n-The menu is ok. Not a lot of diversity in the menu here. Standard American cuisine. \n\nI do love the burgers however, and those dang garlic fries get me everytime! They are great for sharing."}
{"input": "First time tonight. We enjoyed our evening with a great server, Alison. She knew we had not been here before and helped us through everything. Most of all we spent a lot of time catching up with old friends, and we never felt hurried.\n\nThe food was great, and we tried everything from steaks to meat loafs. All was prepared to our request and the meals were great.\n\nLook forward to coming back. Hope it is just as good next time."}
{"input": "our group went the other day and though the food was good, personally i thought it wasn't that special.. it's average.\n\nthere were 8 of us and i can only remember that there were 3 bento boxes, a general tso's and my katsu; oh and i split the quail egg wrapped around in bacon with a friend which by the way cost us $7 for just 2 sticks of 3.. but it was good! and we had a bottle of sake.. overall the bill was around $150, not bad.\n\nI hear MIXX has this awesome sushi deal around lunchtime.. word of mouth by my boyfriend who loves sushi, i think i'll go back next time to just try that."}
{"input": "Amazing food, great atmosphere. Glad we now have a quick way to get our Indian cuisine! I will definitely be back and bringing friends and family!!"}
{"input": "Pretty much the best place to get boba tea and shaved ice in the St. Pete area. I've been here a few times and everything I have ordered has been made exactly how I thought it would be. I feel that you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The fact they serve sticky rice with many of their dishes get an A+ for me. \n\nYou can tell their food is made fresh and with  a lot of love. It is a must try when in the St Pete area."}
{"input": "Lovely little flower shop with great staff. Stopped in for a couple arrangements for a wedding shower, nothing pre-made but said they could put something together quickly. Within 10 minuted had 2 of these lovely arrangements. They did a great job and were affordable. Highly recommend this cute shop!"}
{"input": "Yummy! I had the lemon ginger donut as dessert and had two sliders for my meal. I will say at lunch time on a Monday, getting those two sliders took over a half hour.  Only downside is these guys are waaaaay too busy."}
{"input": "Ugh, what a disappointment. My husband and I love creole, Cajun cooking and had such high hopes for this place. We had heard great things. The appetizers were great, the bloody Mary's good and the service was fantastic. So why only two stars? The entrees were not good. I had crab ravioli and it was ok. Decent sauce but not real pizazz. My husband had the jambalaya and cat fish and to be honest it seemed as if it was left overs. The jambalaya was horrible-old. The shrimp and sausage were falling apart as of cooked way too long and there was just no flavor. Very disappointing."}
{"input": "This place made me want to move to Boise. Everyone was very friendly, and the space is beyond cool. Also a great selection of beers from the NW."}
{"input": "Recently visited for a family birthday dinner. I chose the restaurant from my past experience. I have to say I was disappointed with my entree  on this visit.\n\nI had the grilled Mahi Mahi, usually my fave fish. The Mahi had no flavor, was very bland, and a sort of \"fishy taste.\" The side of Capellini pasta was equally disappointing. The Marinara sauce tasted like pure tomato sauce out of the can. \n\nThe other entrees at the table were Veal Montalbano and chicken Pontchartrain. The guests liked their entrees, so maybe I chose the wrong dish, but I don't think I will be back for awhile."}
{"input": "Hated this place I went in to try an egg roll and get a sushi roll and both were bad the egg was horrible and the sushi was chewy so I wasnt surprised that I was the only one there"}
{"input": "David did an excellent job repairing a small crack in my windshield.  Work was done cleanly and quickly and he even cleaned my car windows."}
{"input": "A small aquarium that is interesting mainly for kids.  They have a shark feeding show and stingrays that you can pet and buy food to feed.  It is not the first place i would go in Tarpon Springa, but it is ok, small children seem to like it."}
{"input": "Crescent Park is just east of the French Market in the French Quarter. The promenade runs along the Mississippi River for 1.4 miles. It is similar to the Riverwalk in the French Quarter. Crescent Park also has arches that allow you to enter and exit the park since they arch over railroad tracks. The top of the arches provide the best views of the New Orleans skyline.\n\nIf you are visiting New Orleans and looking for recommendations, feel free to message me through Yelp and I can share my itinerary, which includes my Yelp reviews. The information for an electronic copy can also be found via my Yelp profile."}
{"input": "Went here finally w/ E-Dawg and H used to live in Verdi so this has been long time coming.\n\nArrived prior to 2pm happy hour and waited with delicious hot homemade chips for the clock to strike 2.  Worth the wait for delicious esp the red sauce.\n\nFinally not prego so the marg was delish"}
{"input": "I like the homey atmosphere, the drinks and food, and the happy hour specials. I wish the HH drinks had more variety - everything is basically a ginger + lime drink, which I'm sure is very efficient, but not great for folks who don't like ginger/lime."}
{"input": "The easiest car buying experience ever! I worked out the details of the purchase with salesman Larry LaRose on the phone prior to arriving at the dealership. I was nervous that once I went in person, the terms would all of a sudden change but Larry stuck to his word. He made sure I paid no more than what we discussed before and I didn't feel like I was being pressured to \"buy up\" at all. The finance dept was equally impressive. Overall, I highly recommend this dealership!"}
{"input": "Absolutely a place to experience.  Tremendous atmosphere, fabulous service, and food that is simply amazing.  Portion sizes are incredible at a price that is exceptional.  You will enjoy every moment!"}
{"input": "I've ordered twice from here and each time the medium pizzas had a five inches of crust. On one ocassion they only put my toppings on half the pizza when it was to be on the whole thing. Never again"}
{"input": "Great neighborhood coffee shop.  Decent prices, good food, nice environments inside and out.  I like the huevos banditos.  Nice people who work there"}
{"input": "First night went here, great place and food.  Second time different story.  Inattentive, incorrect order and food seems to be from a completely different kitchen!  Overheard other customers with issues too while waiting.  Hopefully they can fix and not let the young hosts and managers with attitude ruin before too late."}
{"input": "The hotdog was ok I would go back for the fried pickles   They were the best it's a fun little place to grab a quick bite to eat"}
{"input": "Excellent quality sushi. The sashimi and nigiri are fresh and generous in size.\n\nTop notch sushi with limited roll options. A must go to place if you are a true sushi lover"}
{"input": "Stopped in for morning coffee.  This is one of the new prototypes, very new, clean and sparkling.  Service was friendly with a smile.  Food is BK, you know what to expect."}
{"input": "This restaurant was absolutely incredible. The reviews on the food were super helpful. My friend and I shared the Mexican corn, the steak bites, the ranch burger, and the prosciutto flatbread. Everything was beyond expectations. Even the butter that came with the hot crispy bread was insane. I have definitely found a new place to come back to every time I visit Santa Barbara‼"}
{"input": "1st time eating here. Very clean, nice folks and very good sushi.  Would and will go back. Service was spot on, sushi was very fresh and reasonably priced ."}
{"input": "As far as I'm concerned, San Antonio Taco IS the 21st/Vandy area. The cheese is legendary, the food comes fast, and the place is always abuzz with students and locals. It's a restaurant that comes to feel like home -- waiting customers sign their names on the walls, the chefs know you by your order, and the finches outside sit like dogs waiting for leftovers.\nThe food isn't that cheap, but it's the most filling fare in the neighborhood. The tortillas are so fresh you can watch them rise in the oven. And, oh my god, the cheese."}
{"input": "I Really really absolutely wanted to like this place. Maybe the kitchen was having a bad night? It was our First try so went with the basics: \nchicken quesadilla appetizer, Bacon Cheeseburger and Waffle Fries. \nQuesadilla had no flavor.\nThe burger was way over cooked, dry and flavorless. So sad.  \nHusbands \"Smashy\" burger was overcooked too.\nThe Waffle Fries were OK. Service was good, it was not busy at 7pm on a Saturday probably due to the rain.\nA burger and beer joint with so so burgers\nI really wanted to like it"}
{"input": "Stopped by for lunch (AGAIN).  I would have gone to a New England tradition, the lobster roll, but felt a little adventurous,  and went for the lobster wrap with pico de gallo & a spicy mayo.  Can I say, YUM!  The lobster had a touch of lemon that really helped bring out the flavor, & it was nice and chunky... not overdressed.  It was served in a standard flour tortilla with kettle chips and a vinegar touched cold slaw.  If I were you, I wouldn't wait until you were in the area to stop by.  It's worth the trip & you can bring home a few live lobsters to boot!"}
{"input": "I ordered from Royal Chef through BeyondMenu, and am very impressed.  I had a few special requests (fried rice made with brown rice, all my food cooked in very very little oil, extra veggies)...and the food is PERFECT.  I mean, it is EXACTLY what I ordered.  The overall flavor of the food is fairly mainline as far as Chinese goes, the delivery time was within five minutes of their estimate, and I got a good amount of food.  Combine that with their perfect execution of my special orders, and it's safe to say I'll be ordering from here again!"}
{"input": "Food was very greasy,  service very bad, was seated at two tables  not cleaned or set. Will not return there."}
{"input": "Total Wine & More is much, much better. I don't this this BevMo location will be open much longer. There are probably a maximum of 2 employees working here at any given time. Most of of their inventory is out of date and overpriced by a wide margin.\n\nNo wonder this place is so empty."}
{"input": "My first impression of the menu was that it was a little on the pricey side for what is served.  As I looked around, I noticed that they do have daily specials that are pretty reasonable.  \n\nI had the fried crawfish salad and \"el hubs\" had the Boudreaux Pizza.  Both were pretty good.  There are several  things I would like to come back to try, like \"the barge, \" which is enough fried seafood for 2 people!!!\n\nI will make sure to visit again and try their all you can eat catfish on Tuesdays, too!!!"}
{"input": "By far some of the most comfy theater recliners. My only complaint is that you have to put your feet down if someone wants to pass by you on the aisle. The bartender at the little lounge next to the theaters is a delight. And being able to drink in the theater is a nice plus. The drawback comes with concessions. At a peak time on a Saturday, there were 5-6 employees at the counter but utter disorganization and no hustle whatsoever. The popcorn was also burnt. Next time I'll eat beforehand and stick with the bar."}
{"input": "The food took forever- servers were really friendly, but they looked very unorganized. Example, after breakfast we asked for a heated cinnamon roll and it sat so long it got cold again lol. It was amazing though once we finally got it. The pork belly was great, eggs way undercooked. Overall, we might go back for a cinnamon roll to go, but not to eat, just not worth the waiting."}
{"input": "I cannot believe I haven't written a review for my favorite restaurant in Louisiana! Seriously, if I was on death row, the BBQ Shrimp would be last thing my taste buds ever enjoyed. I highly suggest wearing the bib they give you - unless of course you like to wear your dinner proudly. \n\nEven if you aren't a shrimp fan, their filets are always cooked to perfection and their gumbo is delicious. \n\nDon't forget to grab a cocktail too - their Bloody Mary's will save your life. \n\nThey even have a room in the back for private parties - which is great for rehearsal dinners, graduation parties, etc. \n\nMr. B's is the B's knees!"}
{"input": "This is our go-to breakfast spot when we're back in town. I love the fresh juice offerings and the guac! We brought friends here who wanted to indulge in New Orleans bites. They liked the crab omelet and the bananas foster \nfrench toast. Service is friendly and can be slow, in keeping with the general vibe of the city. I'm sure it's mentioned in other reviews, but for the record: cash only (there is an ATM on premises)."}
{"input": "Neil and the crew down at Gardens Of Babylon are incredible! The go extremely out of their way to help answer questions, offer organic gardening techniques, outsource supplies for projects... The list goes on. Having them on-site was another great experience! They were able to get a better grasp of what my landscapes conditions were... Which is challenging (too much pooling water, no sunlight). They go above and beyond to make sure that I stay under budget but to also make sure what will and will not work to ensure a long lasting beautiful landscape. I'd recommend these guys until I was blue in the face. A+++"}
{"input": "I have not been here in years, everybody who knows food in Tucson has either been here or at least heard about it.  My memory was the food was amazing but the atmosphere was a little too claustrophobic grandmas french parlor (reminded me of some old school places i went to in France and Belgium).  What I experienced this time was mouth watering, buttery rich satisfying impeccable dishes, as well as a cleaner more updated venue.  It was packed for a weeknight, and when you go there you will know why.  This is a true Tucson gem!"}
{"input": "The wash was very average and very little attention to detail on the inside and around door jams and inside my gas cap wasn't touched. They didn't wash my car mats and my carpets were wet for a week. I asked him to pay particular attention to the overhead liner, as someone had recently smoked in my car, but that was also untouched. My visors on both sides were untouched.  And the numerous stains on my seats are still there, because they don't use a stain removal enzyme.  It's not auto detailing, it's a car wash. \n\nThe staff is super friendly.  But for $100 I expected quite a bit more."}
{"input": "Wasn't that busy they might have had 4 servers on. Our server took forever to get us CANNED BEERS, we NEVER GOT OUR WATERS. Our appetizer came AFTER we finished our food. They comped it, but didn't try to make amends about the rest of horrible experience. We will NEVER GO BACK."}
{"input": "I love Le Chandelier. I stumbled upon the salon when I first moved to the area a few years ago. From the outside, it looked cute and clean, so I gave it a try and have been going back ever since.\n\nThe team at Le Chandelier is both friendly and accommodating. Upon arrival, you are greeted warmly and offered something to drink, and I have never had to wait more than a minute or two for my appointment to start. I have only had my hair cut, so I cannot speak to other services. But I leave happy each time I visit, which is most important.\n\nThe only downfall is you cannot tip on a card, so don't forget cash."}
{"input": "What is not to love about ted drewes?   It was the first place my husband brought me on a pre marriage trip to Saint Louis.  We ended up going four times in one weekend.  The only thing that would make it better is if it was calorie free!"}
{"input": "My family and I were visiting Nashville, staying in the Hillsboro-Belmont area. It was our last night and after sighting and non stop go go go for several days we wanted a quiet/easy takeout night. My grandmother said she wanted a burger and when Nana wants a burger, she gets a burger. We chose this place because it was close and we were blown away. The place was busy and crowded but that is always a sign of great things to come. The bartenders were very friendly with all guests, not just regulars. I wish I knew the name of the gentleman who took my order, cause he got my order completely right off memory save one thing and had me check the receipt for any missed modifications. We got our food home and devoured it. The ketchup that I didn't even ask for, but was included was  fantastic and homemade. I can't say enough how I much I enjoyed my experience and the food."}
{"input": "Love dining here.  From the restaurant and the unique meat options to the tri tip barbecue I am always pleased.  The service and staff are wonderful!"}
{"input": "Had the patrol combo with a fresh squeezed orange juice and loved it! Cage free eggs were cooked well. Sausages were very high quality and not fatty. Even the jam that came with the toast was pretty good. It tasted natural, not too sweet with actual fruit preserves in it!\n\nThe luau french toast , made on hawaiian bread was pretty good too.\n\nThe only downside is that the wait for the food itself is a bit longer ,but nothing unreasonable. I think it took about 15 to 20 minutes for the food to come out. As long as you have some time to spare , I would recommend giving this place a try. Ingredients are healthy and fresh. \n\nThere is parking right across from the restaurant."}
{"input": "Nothing has changed since my last review. Their donuts are still the best in town hands down. They've added delicious donut holes to their line if scrumptious products. Their breakfast and lunch sandwiches are made to order. Many choices to pick from. If you haven't been to Tony's donuts you're missing the boat. When you go tell George and John that I sent you !!!!"}
{"input": "Finally a real coffee shop in New Tampa!!! The nitro iced coffee was great and the staff very friendly."}
{"input": "We got diverted to Tampa and decided to make the drive to Orlando but first we needed somewhere to eat. Wanting to avoid chain restaurants, yelp steered us towards this little local gem!\n\nThe ladies had the 7 oz. Tampa strip and the gents both had a 14 oz. ribeye. They grill their steaks over oak and citrus Wood and the smoky flavor is to die for! We are big fans of our smoker back home and cook our steaks this way as well, it's rare to find steak cooked over woodsmoke in most places and this was worth the side trip!  Sides were veggies and sweet potatoes. The wines on offer were so reasonably priced- most under $20 a bottle but a decent selection. They just don't mark them up 5x like most places! \n\nOur waitress Lisa also made great recommendations and her service was welcoming, friendly, and excellent. We are so glad we went local instead of to a chain. Bookmarking this place for a return trip next time I am in Tampa for sure!"}
{"input": "I've been coming here since high school and finally made my rounds 6 years later (lets pretend I didn't just say 6 years). 7 courses, $25, byo, eat with yo hands.\n\nFor realz this place is awesome. People tend to get a little turned off when they hear moroccan food with your hands. If you're that person, don't come because you'll ruin an awesome experience for your friends. Every course is awesome and the service is just as good.\n\nTheres belly dancers who even get the guests involved. You smirk now, but a bottle of wine in and you're going to be dancing too."}
{"input": "They put pickle on a gyro, I mean, what is that about?\n\nOther than the pickle, the gyro is solid, rather large, and filling.  Not mind blowing, just solid.  Did I mention the pickle?\n\nUpdate:\n\nI received some feedback from the ownership and I must say I'm impressed with their outreach to their customer base.  To clarify, the whole pickle thing struck me as odd because of both its inclusion and the overall taste of it in the gyro.  It was immediately removed and eaten after the gyro. I'm somewhat of a gyro snob, they hold a special place in my heart, and I believe simplicity is best with them.  Strong Tzatziki, great meat, fresh veg, quality pita, sorted.\n\nI will certainly be back with the misses to try something else, so please don't take my review as an outright dismissal.  Based on my next experience it may very well imrpove."}
{"input": "Bought a pair of boots and needed to return because I found a cuter less expensive paid at Nine West outlet. When I returned the cashier would not let me keep my original receipt she would only give me back the return receipt. I do not like this policy because I have to reconcile my credit card statement and not having that receipt makes it impossible. She balked when I said I needed to at least take a pic of it.  Doubt I'll go back."}
{"input": "An endless supply of imaginative pizza combinations.  The slices are reasonably priced and large, although you will probably want two.  The beer selection is good and this is the only place in recent memory that carded my 50ish colleague when buying pitchers!\r\n\r\nArrive early for outdoor seating (there isn't much indoors).  A favorite student hangout, but not quite as busy as the Frog next door.  \r\n\r\nPersonal favorites:\r\nAll of the standards (pepperoni, sausage, etc)\r\nBuffalo chicken pizza\r\nThat pizza with potato on it\r\nThat other pizza with pesto and artichokes"}
{"input": "I've been going here now for a couple of months. I have never received more compliments on my nails then I have since seeing Nary! \n\nI love all the girls that work there, and we all banter amongst each other, and the other clients as well. No more sitting in silence while I get my nails done!! Yay!\n\nI recommend making an appointment! This is not a dime a dozen nail salon! They offer the newest designs and jewels that so many others don't, and because of that, it's busy. You can walk in, but prepare to sit and wait. And if you want crazy encrusted nails, you can get them here! But you'll pay for what you want, so if you're on a budget throw out your number from the beginning so you aren't shocked at check out. \n\nSee you ladies in 2 weeks!!"}
{"input": "I have to be honest, I was a little skeptical going into the 10-minute workout because all my life I've never been told you only need to workout 10 minutes a week. After doing my first 10-minute workout with Quantify Fitness my mind was blown! I left feeling like I ran 6 miles and then some. I was sore for days after and it honestly was the best quick workout I've ever done. I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"input": "Honestly the staff was SO friendly here Alyssa Richardson, Kelly Childress, Parker and Brandon from the carrousel bar are the BOMB.COM. They all deserve the world, so personable, such good attitudes and just all around great staff. I definitely recommend accommodations here just because of them. \n\nXoxo D & Jay"}
{"input": "If I could give half a star I would, I'm from Tx, and anyone that thinks this is BBQ, I am willing to apologize to you for being led to believe that this is what BBQ is like.\nI ordered the sample platter, horrific, the chicken looked and tasted like frozen pressed meat, the ribs.... All cartilage, the sausage, bland.... The sauce.... Walmart basic sauce with cups of sugar thrown in.... Extremely overpriced for ummm.... A child's plate (what it seemed like). I would never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"input": "This place is close to where I work, so I go here a lot for lunch or dinner.  The food is awesome!  If you have a choice between the misou soup or the mushroom soup, go with the mushroom soup, AWESOME.  I love the sushi, super fresh and they make pretty cool designs on the plate.  I've had hibachi here also, so good.  I ate everything.    The prices are decent.  \n\nI didn't give it 5 stars because they only serve beer and wine, which is not what I want to drink when I go out for sushi.  I want some cool cocktails!  Also, the on the inside, the place is beautiful, but it looks seriously sketchy on the outside.  Why are the blinds closed???  it makes me think (what the heck are they doing in there at night?  It's uncomfortable."}
{"input": "I travel often for work and having a box that feels like home is a big deal. Was able to make two drop-ins at the Downtown location and could not have been happier. Phil Guillot was a fantastic coach, the format and style were great, and the location and space were phenomenal. Now the expectations for my home box have been raised and I wish I lived closer!"}
{"input": "I miss this place soooo much.  Probably my favorite frozen custard place in the entire world!  The hype is totally worth it.  Please make a chain around the US (and Japan)!!"}
{"input": "The food has always been good. Love the BLT. \nThe potato skins were very good too. \nIt's very roomy and great for large parties."}
{"input": "If you decide to eat here, just be aware it is going to take about 2 hours from beginning to end. We have tried it multiple times, because I want to like it! I have been to it's other locations in NJ and never had a bad experience. \n\nThe food is good, but it takes a very long time to come out. The waitstaff is very young, but usually pleasant. We have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting. We usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends, in order to be done quicker."}
{"input": "We bought/rented some kegs from BevMo for our wedding and overall, our experience was good.\n\nWe decided to go with BevMo because of their selection and prices.  We ordered two 7 gallon kegs of \"local\" beer (Oak Creek), and when we went to pick them up, one of them was labeled wrong which caused a lot of distress because we didn't realize it until we'd gotten to our venue an hour and a half away.  However once it was tapped we realized it was the correct beer.\n\nWe also rented taps and tubs to keep the kegs cold- it was nice to be able to get all of those items in one place and have people help us load it in our truck.\n\nAfter our wedding we returned the items and the deposit was refunded on our card in a heartbeat.  Easy and fast, we'd totally do it again!"}
{"input": "I cannot express how much I LOVE this place! I haven't tried anything I haven't loved, and I have tried almost the whole menu. The Service is friendly, parking is readily available, the environment is welcoming and the fruit is always fresh. My only complaint is that they don't have a location in San Diego!"}
{"input": "Location, Location, Location and boutique hotel is what this hotel has going for it. Plus, extremely comfortable beds. The bed, blankets and pillows were the most comfortable I've ever had at a hotel. Plus, it's located at the heart of everything but not right on Bourbon street so it's still quiet. Our room was on the ground level right off the courtyard which was lovely. The only downfall is the room was just big enough for two double beds, a dresser, chair and desk. There wasn't much room to move around in but that didn't matter to us as we didn't spend that much time in the room. The bathroom is very spacious which is nice. I would highly recommend this to others visiting New Orleans wanting to be in the French Quarter but not in the middle of all the noise."}
{"input": "Was not expected much, until we arrived the it was packed outside. Not only was it packed but they were extremely efficient. The custard was great I did not think it was overly sweet and some what light. I had the tiramisu with pistachio and that was good. Kind of their version of it but none the less great! Would definitely go back when I am in town!"}
{"input": "Cash only; it's $35 per person 6-item fixed menu plus whatever drinks you want to order. Make sure you come with lots of people, reserve in advanced. The seating really creates a communal atmosphere where you can share off the same plate and chill. What an experience, probably one of the most memorable dining experiences you can get here in Philly. Once you're seated, you get your hands washed with rose water while you're surrounded by dim light and cushy blankets. Then, the food rolls out, and man is it good. I've never had chicken this succulent in my life; it literally fell off the bone. Another highlight was the mint tea during dessert, wow. Awesome spot, will be back for another special occasion."}
{"input": "Best dining experience I've had in nola so far. Mind you, it was like 3:00 on a Tuesday. We got the burger that has the grilled cheese in it. Also the sampler thingy - red beans and rice, jambalaya, some kind of etouffe soup type thing. All amazing. The bacon on the burger was some frickin amazing bacon. Beef was cooked perfectly. We also had these weird hush puppy looking things that were topped with tobacco infused powdered sugar. They called it a bignet but it wasn't the kind of bignet I imagined. Anyway, it was interesting and yummy. \n\nWe sat at the bar. Fantastic service!! Wish I could remember the lady's name. It was this week so whoever the bartender was on Tuesday. She provided us with some helpful tips. Kept our drinks full. Helped bag up our leftovers too. Great service. \n\nAtmosphere was good. The upstairs was closed because it's winter."}
{"input": "Nice sit-down pizza spot in the Loop area, near Washington University. We went on a Friday night, so they were fairly busy and sat outside. Service was friendly, but not as attentive as one might hope.\n\nPizza was very good...we had two types of pizza. Ingredients seemed fresh, and the crust was nice and chewy. It seems like a small would be enough for two....they recommended a large, but we only ate about half of it.\n\nThe inside seemed very loud...we were glad to be sitting outside.\n\nOverall, a nice spot for pizza."}
{"input": "Randy did a great job on the tour and incorporated some sights regarding the history of the city as well."}
{"input": "this place was so awesome. we went on sunday so the drinks were 2 for the price of one. they have a great little sitting area outside where you can sit and wait for your table to be ready. I had the Blood & Smoke, im not a huge fan of bloody marys usually but this was amazing. the food was also great, and came out fairly quick after ordering. they also had a DJ playing a variety of music the whole time and I really enjoyed that.  I definitely will visit this place again."}
{"input": "came here for good reviews. sorry but was not happy with my cut. not faded.i always say if they don't do a good fade, haircut is a shame. 2 minute massage. didn't last long enough. \nnever coming back"}
{"input": "Love the food and decor but this place is incredibly loud! The servers are great but the hostesses could use an attitude adjustment - not very friendly for the first people you talk to when you arrive. \nI love the pancakes and the bacon is always crispy. My mom loves all of the fresh soups and salads. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The online check in is nice too since the wait is always long on the weekends!"}
{"input": "I love having this DG right downtown. There are a few household items I only buy from DG and it's great that I can walk up on my lunch break and mark that errand off my list. I have noticed that they seem to have a smaller inventory of home items and seasonal items. Prices are still great and lines move quickly."}
{"input": "I love Jess and the Apronettes!   Their chicken salad is to die for and chicken soup is just like mom's. Pauline is the best.  Don't miss their chicky pot pies!  A++++++++"}
{"input": "Finally checked this place out last night. Really quaint with great ambiance. There is no cover charge to hear the great live music. They offer a small collection of wine and cheese. They will plate the cheese for an additional fee but well worth it as it comes with bread, nuts, jam, olives, and pickles. Definitely recommend sitting outside to enjoy the band. There are heaters for those extra chilly days/nights. The environment is pretty low key so its great for a date night and even groups. Didnt try any of the food but everything i saw looked delish. Will definitely return!"}
{"input": "Had an awesome exp here. Great customer service, very clean room that smelled very nice. ( Like a mango ) and awesome buffet in the morning for 10.99\nHighly recommend staying here"}
{"input": "No complaints as far as Taco Bells go. Terrible for you and terribly delicious. This place is my fast food kryptonite. \n\nThe service here is quick & friendly and they've never screwed up my order, which is more than I can say for other Taco Bell locations."}
{"input": "We came here for lunch since my very special guest was on a very special diet and this place seemed like there was a wide range of options to choose from. We got seated pretty fast. The food portions were huge! I got a steak quesadilla and it came with soup, a pretty big salad  and fries! I obviously could not finish it all and had to take most of it home. They could, however, do a little better job on seasoning the food. The prices are very reasonable."}
{"input": "I was having difficulty finding a pair of good shoes for walking, saw a coupon in a mailer about this place, and was so glad that I went there. The man and woman working there, maybe husband and wife? Owners? Were extremely attentive, knowledgeable and so very helpful. I must've tried on 20 pairs of shoes, and finally settled on a pair that I am very happy with, thanks to their detailed attention. I wholeheartedly recommend this store if you want to get a pair of running or walking shoes with great fit at a decent price, sold to you by people who really know what they're talking about."}
{"input": "Pretty straight forward. \n\nChicken fingers, fries cole slaw and some Texas toast. It's simple and good. \n\nThe sauce definitely makes it. Remember to get some sweet tea to wash it down."}
{"input": "My husband and I went here on a Friday evening. A woman cut right in front of us as we walked up to the hostess stand and got her party of four promptly seated. We then walked up to the hostess. They had six tables open as well as people finishing their meals at several other tables. Yet they insisted they could only seat us outside (it was a torrential downpour with thunder and lightning) or at the sushi bar. When we asked about how long it would be to wait for a table they first said about 30 minutes which we agreed to (despite there being 6 open tables) yet then a moment later the manager came over and said it was not possible to wait for a table.\n\nWhile I can not comment on the quality of food I can say their service is absolutely horrendous. I can not fathom why it was impossible to seat us at a table despite the 6 open tables or allow us to wait for one yet we could sit out in the storm or at the bar. I will not be returning here."}
{"input": "Have had better Gyros before. My wife tried the Doner plate, it came with a nice salad,4 different sauces, fresh fries (which for me were the highlight of the meal), some lamb meat and 2 breads. I tried the Doner Berlin which had almost the same contents (except the fries) stuffed inside a Pita-like bread. Pretty simple. Nothing to really brag about.\n\nWe went on a sunday evening around 6:30 pm and we were the only ones there.\n\nPlenty of street parking available within a blocks range.\n\nStaff were friendly but that doesn't compensate for the taste.\n\nDidn't really live up to my expectations I must say. (Maybe I had high expectations to begin with)."}
{"input": "The service was lacking. The waiters and waitresses don't know the menu and when you ask for certain things to be brought to your table, it's constantly forgotten. The food is visually appealing but some of the most awkward and distasteful food I've ever had. The waffles are stale, the biscuits are hard as rock and their chorizo is not real chorizo.\n\nThe only thing this place has going for it is the atmosphere and their alcohol selection."}
{"input": "Place is great!! Tacos and burritos and plenty of choices! They have different flavor sauces as well that you can try. All different tastes from mild to hot and also some sweet. It's a great place in Westchase. For sure try it!!"}
{"input": "This location has always had good food and service in the past but my last 3 purchases have been awful.  I used the drive-thru about once a week but No More.  Food has been cold. (The beef was colder than the lettuce!)  They have left out napkins and also no sauces which were asked for.  I was used to good service here and never needed to check my order when handed to me.  Just tired of the sloppiness and rude service.  Hate to see this location fall apart.  I won't be back."}
{"input": "The worker was awesome; this is a review for the company.  The price paid isn't in alignment to the service provided, it is just expensive. The worker is still paid hourly, which motivates him/her to work the hours. I believe it is a better way to hire someone off craigslist and pay them to do a service, rather than hourly."}
{"input": "Loved it! The staff is incredibly genuine and sweet. I fell outside the restaurant and was greeted with an entire first aid kit and staff constantly checking up on me. Food was amazing- I'd suggest the tenderloin."}
{"input": "Excellent customer service, quick and efficient service. Thank you to Alex and guy with a 'manager' patch. The oils change, fluid checks, tire fills, and an air filter replacement took about 20 minutes. Cost was $85, which was a little price-y, but it was friendly and quick service."}
{"input": "Breakfast was above average and reasonably priced, especially considering the options available near convention center. Service could be better. They are pleasant, mostly, if you can get their attention. Coffee was amazing and I was particularly thankful they offer a cup to go when you're finished!!!  Portions are plenty and ingredients are fresh and a little inventive."}
{"input": "We just had the best experience at Brick City Eatery! We sat at the bar area and watched the workers make the pizzas....so much fun. The pizzas were delicious! We will definitely be back! The staff was friendly and helpful!"}
{"input": "Normally we are big fans of Carrabbas.  Last night, 1/17/15, was an exception.  We waited 45 minutes to be seated after calling ahead. The place was very crowded.  We sat at the table for 10 minutes before Stephanie S approached our table.  She took our drink order and said she would bring bread.  She brought the drinks but no bread. Also, she never explained the specials (we happened to overhear the waiter at the table next to us explaining them.) The salad came and I had to ask for the bread.  The food, as usual, was good.  I had tilapia and my husband had mahi, with sides of spinach and garlic mashed potatoes which were all very good.  As soon as I put my fork down, the waitress swooped behind me and took the plate away while my husband was still eating.  She never asked if I was finished.  She seemed very stressed out and her service reflected it.  Such a shame because normally the waitstaff is very cordial and accommodating."}
{"input": "We are from out of town here on vacation. We really enjoyed the restaurant and the fish tank display. There is a lot of interesting Guy Harvey merchandise up front also."}
{"input": "Best pizza I've ever had with even better service! A must place to eat in Indiana! It is fairly priced as well and caters to a variety of tastes."}
{"input": "Pretty bad customer service and wait time - waited over 25 minutes for two hot sandwiches. One person working the grill on a Sunday morning. She seemed more interested in chatting with her co-workers than cooking. The place was steadily busy but not overwhelming to warrant such a long wait. Counters for patrons to sit at appeared to not have been wiped down in a few days. Overall our sandwiches were good; so if you are ready to wait, you'll be fine. Been to other bagel shops in the surrounding area and on busy mornings have never waited longer than 5-10 minutes."}
{"input": "Best steak sandwich in town.  Best hummus plate in town.  Best Cubano I have ever tasted...and all in a great atmosphere and smiling faces!  This place deserves nothing less than five stars."}
{"input": "This place is amazing. First time I have tried Turkish coffee and LOVED it here. The veggie wrap and cheese steak is also great. This place gives off great vibes, there is an entire cafe section within the restaurant. I will definitely make sure to come back to this place if I am in West Philly ever again. 5 stars."}
{"input": "Kind of a cool spot. We were there when it was pretty dead, but the layout is cool and the bowling lanes are just fine. \nRun a little loose. \nGood selection of beer and the crew was pretty nice. \nIt would be nice to see the place when it's hopping."}
{"input": "As much as it pains me to concede this there prices are considerably more reasonable than Midas.... About $100 difference to get my shocks replaced!"}
{"input": "Terrible selection, even worse quality. Big mistake. Skip this place. Not worth the price!"}
{"input": "My brother and I ate here to celebrate my college graduation and I must say I was very satisfied. Great vibes in the restaurant, our waiter was outstanding, and the food was delish."}
{"input": "I stopped at Walgreens in hopes of seeing the new ELF Villain's collection. Sometimes Walgreens gets them before the holidays. Sometimes they don't. This particular one doesn't ever get them according to their cosmetics person. SAD. Really sad. I suppose I'll have to skulk other Walgreens to find them."}
{"input": "I like that they have unusual toppings, and the pizza's good. But I took a star off for the terrible breaded chicken topping - it's almost grey. They also have left toppings off twice - when I called back the second time, they told me I'd get a free topping on my next order. That wasn't honored when I called for my next order. So, I'm glad there's a MidCity pizza delivery place, but I'm annoyed at the lack of service and the low-quality chicken."}
{"input": "We've been shopping here since this location was a Wild Oats. Perhaps I'm just imagining things, but I'd swear it has gotten better since the merger of these two chains.\n\nI love the produce, seafood and cheese here. But it's the personal care section with tons o' natural cosmetics, handmade soaps and the like that brings us in most often. Well, that and the salad bar. In the cooler months, nothing beats hitting Whole Foods for a post-yoga lunch of soup and salad or the deli salad sampler plate. The Carrot Ginger, Split Pea and Corn Chowder soups are the best! Other sure bets: the curried tofu salad (or pretty much any of the deli-made tofu items), sushi to-go boxes and the everything cookies. My most recent find: lavender soda - kinda' dry and really does relax you :-)"}
{"input": "Unique  is very professional and, based on my experience, operates with the utmost of integrity.\nResponsive, transparent, honest are a few words that come to mind .  There technicians were efficient, clean and pleasant. Their pricing was extremely fair. I can state all of this with the highest degree of confidence because it is based on direct experience, not conjecture or inference. The sales person I dealt with (Mike P) and manager Chris are both top notch. \nThe house was left spotless, the work was performed to the highest standards. I recommend them highly.  I also encourage you to compare their prices to outfits of similar size and stature."}
{"input": "I really wanted to like this place because of the cool ambiance.  I ordered the Philly cheese steak.  Aside from the mediocre taste, small portion size, and unreasonably high price of my entree,  the fact that it gave me food poisoning really nailed it home.  On the plus side, nobody else at my table endured food poisoning from their entrees (omelets and juevos rancheros) and the wait staff was pleasant."}
{"input": "I recently had the pre fixe meal for $22 and I enjoyed the combination of tastes on my plate. The chicken was moist my veggies were tasty but a little too greasy....overall is was a great meal. \n\nI also use them for take out/delivery. I have always enjoyed the way the package their food, in plastic containers that I use over and over again until they look too worn out and I recycle them. I hate take out places that use so much boxes and cups and card board - it's extremely eco-unfriendly. \n\nThe food here is never spectacular but is a good standby you will always come away enjoying. The prices seem a little steep but the restaurant atmosphere is contemporary, the service has always been splendid and the food is dependable."}
{"input": "Catfish, poboys, raw oysters, red beans & rice. Oh my! The food at Desire was too good! My family is from Louisiana and the red beans & rice are almost as good as my grandma's which is great! I will be back to eat here. Seating wasn't bad either."}
{"input": "I like the pizza and everyone is friendly, but their ordering system for pick ups and dining is always inefficient.  I gave the food a 4 and service a 2."}
{"input": "I've only been once, but I'm ready to return.\n\nSince moving to Fletcher Place, I've been looking for a bar near by that's similar to my neighborhood favorite, J Clydes. I think I've found it.\n\nThe Dugout is a simple hole-in-the-wall place. They have a decent selection, Sun King for $4.50, happy hour appetizers, and my favorite part: HOT PEPPER CHEESE BALLS! No longer must I wait until my coveted Mug N' Bun trips for these fried morsels of tasty peppery goodness. Had a nice little piece form this joint, too. \n\nReally excited to return."}
{"input": "Non food things: Friendly, attentive service. New, clean space. Lots of seating.  \nFood things: Delicious tofu bao, delicious bubble tea, huge portions. Tofu with brown sauce came with vegetables and rice and was good but I wish I had ordered something with a bit more punch. Might try something spicy next time, or the tofu with bok choy.\nUpdate: Sesame tofu and sautéed green beans are great, really flavorful especially for vegetarian options. The Taiwanese rice noodles were good, a little less flavorful than I had hoped but they were much better leftover the next day. Still need to try the scallion pancakes!"}
{"input": "How has anyone not given this place 5 stars. Food was great, service was even better. We did make reservations, but only 45 minutes prior to us arriving. \n\nSteamed chocolate dessert was by far my favorite.\n\nThanks for a wonderful evening"}
{"input": "Great food, drinks, and service!!! Thank you to our server Madison! We had an awesome experience!"}
{"input": "Dr. Biscardi is really an eye expert. My eyes are having complicated problems, some doctors even do not sure which is the best way to treat my left eye. She helped me to order a very special type of contacts for my eyes. Dr. Biscardi was very patient and explained my every concern.\nFYI, she seems having a busy schedule, need to book an appointment in a month advance."}
{"input": "This Pho Hoa is just like the one I go to in California, except it's a lot cleaner, bigger, and generally nicer. When you open the menu, the first two pages comprise the entire menu at the Cali location I've been to. However, this place tacks on a whole extra menu about the size of a small dictionary. \n\nThe food is tasty and cheap, too. Some of the better Vietnamese I've had in South Philly."}
{"input": "Totally not what we expected but in a good way . Not only can you buy games but they have over 2300 that you can rent or play in the store! Thanks Victoria for showing us around! Bring your friend on a weeknight and enjoy a few rounds of games and fun."}
{"input": "Only open during Fiesta, the first weekend (friday at noon, sat and sun 10am) in August!!! If you are in Santa Barbara at all on this week of celebration and you love authentic Mexican food you must come here!  You will love all the great food they offer here and the dancing and music.  There is beer and wine.  I usually come here for a big bowl of pazole for breakfast, but before I do that you must order some tomales.  Get here early for the tamales because the line gets long.  This place is the real deal.  And not to be missed if your a serious foodie. Viva la Fiesta!!!"}
{"input": "Cool place for coffee. Their crepes were ok. They have pretty good baked goods. Tried their mint iced tea which was refreshing. They can offer gluten free food which is not mentioned on the menu so you need to ask for it. I think the whole setup was pretty cool and would def go back."}
{"input": "Kohl's makes returns a breeze.  I am a fan of companies with friendly return policy's.  I buy a lot of baby shower gifts at this store.  Really cute Baby Clothes and good prices (especially with coupons and Kohl's Credit Card).   Check Out's near both entrances/exits.  Well lit, clean dressing rooms.  Love the store hours, especially during high shopping times."}
{"input": "Chicken Marsalis, fajitas,smoked salmon were what I enjoyed today along with my Mimosas  of course. Only thing that made me leave off a star was that the crab legs were tasteless and no butter was available to give them some flavor and my mimosas  were a little slow coming but that could just be me."}
{"input": "My mother-in-law has been there for over an year, and their is one issue after another. My wife has had to go and complain because they miss giving her Parkinson Medication, on multiple occasion. Just this week my  mother-in-law did not let my wife to take her out to Christmas shop because Manor Care has not given her a bath in over a week. She also told us that one of the aid, lifted her out of her wheel chair by pull up on her neck. We have talked to the director several time who committed to resolve the issues and does for a while, then something else develops. The state has been involved, but problems still arise. We are now looking into relocating her near our home in Idaho. Do not put any love one in manor care, unless you are able to check on them weekly."}
{"input": "Such a cute shop and the owner is so nice! She recommended a lot of spots around the city for us too! Go check out this shop for all of your souvenir needs :)"}
{"input": "Family diner. Had the buffet. Eclectic assortment: a large chicken leg, fried jalapeño, tamale, two rolled grape leaves, fresh melon. All good. Lots of Mexican choices there. Also has a menu with breakfast served all day long. Friendly, attentive staff. Good place for a casual relaxed meal with no expectations. Next to the Clarion Hotel."}
{"input": "I knew what I was signing up for but first warning sign: cockroach in my bed. Then the fridge started leaking water everywhere until it just died. THEN after calling the front desk to extend our checkout time, some rude hood lady came banging on the door saying she was gonna call the cops. I would've been fine if they charged us an extra day. Customer service is not their strong point. But it makes sense since all they deal with are crackheads here. \"Under new management\"? You need NEWER management."}
{"input": "This is the first time I tried this place and I was really impressed, the food was very tasty...I wouldn't say authentic. ..but still good. Service was great (a smidge sugary sweet) but it's better than having some angry b as a waitress. The only thing is that the restaurant is in the hood. I grew up in this neighborhood and would never come here at night lol.  Happy dining"}

{"input": "Loved the fried chicken & shrimp cocktail here. Great atmosphere and friendly staff; nice place for a date!"}
{"input": "This place is amazing! I've gone for both the chiropractic services and the massages, and I highly recommend both. Before coming to Quest, I had never been to a chiropractor before, and I wasn't sure how I would like it, but Dr. Jeremy is great! I definitely feel a huge difference in my back and shoulders after leaving.\n\nI've also been to several massage appointments with Heidi, and she does an incredible job. By the time I leave a massage, I feel like my back and shoulders are a thousand times looser and more relaxed than when I came in. She's really open to customizing the massages to your specific problem areas -- we always spend most of the time working on back, shoulders, and neck because those areas are where most of my tension is. The office is also a really calm and relaxing atmosphere for getting a massage -- it's very quiet and peaceful.\n\nI'd highly recommend Heidi and Dr. Jeremy!"}
{"input": "We stopped by to check out the hoopla around this restaurant. Given it was a Friday evening the restaurant was overflowing with people and the estimated wait time to get in was about an hours. We were about to walk away when someone said just order over the phone and pick up and that's exactly what we did and picked up the food in about 20 minutes. We ordered seafood and chicken po-boys and a bowl of seafood gumbo. The food was good but overall very very salty and the gumbo was the size of a cup and overpriced ($7.95). The woman who took my order was very friendly and helpful and we will recommend them to others."}
{"input": "I got Cactus delivered. The salsa tastes like there's BBQ sauce in it, which to me is gross. The queso fundido was paste like and was hard to reheat. The chorizo reminded me of a regular pork breakfast sausage.  Portions were generous being delivery. I should have checked reviews first ..."}
{"input": "Great spot to come to if your in Nashville. The have one the best drink deals you can find on thursdays and Saturday's and Sunday's. Food is okay."}
{"input": "Came here for brunch with my family on a day trip to Philly. The ambience was relaxed, though the service was very prompt. \n\nWe began with a shared plate of dips and bread. The dips were really special hummus style and change - we had beet (beautiful color, nice earthy taste), sardine (a bit fishy for my taste, but the rest of my party devoured it) and a third veggie one (my favorite). \n\nI had the smoked cod with basmati rice and boiled egg. Though it isn't a traditional brunch meal, it was a great meal with good flavors and the right portions. \n\nMy mom went with the featured Cyprus breakfast and what looked like hash browns is actually a greek styled cheese, very delish. I would recommend this dish for those looking for brunch fare. \n\nTheir almond milk drink is mmm, yum, very thick and sweet - great for breakfast add-on. \n\nOur waitress was fine, but the host/owner (?) was really welcoming and helpful along the way to bump up my rating."}
{"input": "Where do I start...\nDr. Amy Hoffman, the veterinarian who saved my dog, really went the extra mile. \"V\" was brought to her after being found starving, and with a severely infected tail from someone abusing him. Amy carefully, and with great surgical skill, had to cut the tail bit by bit until all the damage had been removed. The poor little guy was then lovingly rehabbed, before presenting him to me for adoption.\nMaybe another vet would not have dedicated so much personal time to save an abandoned mutt. All I know is that without the skill, compassion, and generosity Dr. Hoffman showed, I would not be the gloriously happy owner of \"V\" the coolest mutt in the world.\nDr. Hoffman was also the doctor who saved my cat, many years ago. She was another abandoned animal that Dr. Amy treated as if it were a blue-ribbon champion. Miss Kittty is now 18 years old!!\nBless you Dr. Amy!!"}
{"input": "It seems to me that whenever we have out of towner guests, our go to place is consistently Katie's. The variety of food wonderfully prepared is 2nd to none. Reasonably priced and delicious, Katie's never disappoints. Whether you choose the grilled ersters, the shrimp and grits, the Cuban sandwich, pizza, or soup & salad you will be very pleased and have a great meal. Daily specials hi-lite local seasonal offerings that keep things fresh. The service staff are warm and friendly. On Sunday's, you will want to time your arrival before church let's out or you will have a bit of a wait. That said, you can always manage while enjoying bottomless Mimosas!"}
{"input": "Just discovered this place and I already love it more than any other Thai place i've tried in SB! Amazing customer service and the food is even better. The management is absolutely wonderful, they saw me waiting for my food to come out and brought me a complimentary thai tea. Try them out for lunch as they have great deals and it's right in the middle of State so you can do a little shopping while you wait (or call ahead if you're in a rush). Took about 10 minutes for fresh pad thai"}
{"input": "So over-rated!  When I visited over 2 weeks, so many things broken (showers, toilets,) cleanliness marginal and management attitude like they're doing you a favor.  Strong sales pitch too!"}
{"input": "This is my third experience at Bliss Nails. The first two times I got pedicures and I was happy with them. This time I got a pedi and gel nail with the chrome and I love it! Really friendly nail techs and the lady that did my pedicure was really friendly too. I'm very impressed with this salon."}
{"input": "Amber tried to give us old fries and weren't having it. Cold and burnt, we are not the ones. Get it together."}
{"input": "The food is average. Drink specials are great but the place is rarely crowded. Last time I was there it was a Friday night at 10 pm. There were maybe 3 other parties at the bar. About 5 minutes after ordering our first drink, they announced it was last call...at 10:15 PM on a Friday night! Needless to say we left for a different bar in the area and have removed it from our options of places to go past 6 pm for drinks."}
{"input": "Chili was watery with grissley meat.  Sent back and exchanged for chicken tortilla. Ice in soda was mildew.  Asked for manager and he said he couldn't smell the mildew. Baloney.  The ice was contaminated.  Don't eat here!!!!"}
{"input": "Sooo slow! I've never seen anyone that works at this location do anything at a normal pace. I'm not even asking for super speed. Just a reasonable pace."}
{"input": "There's a huge pool in the middle of the club that isn't utilized. What's the point of it? The music selection isn't great either, but it's cool that famous people dj here on fridays."}
{"input": "Coming from Los Angeles where the hair style culture is \"bigger,\" I have been looking for a barber shop like this. The barber I had knew how to contour without any additional instruction and was able to part my hair just the way my barbers in LA did. They use Layrite and other high quality products so you know they're serious about making their customers look their best. Definitely recommend this place. Oh and there's beer."}
{"input": "This is a fantastic shop. They were extremely quick and were completely honest. I hate going to mechanics since I usually get nickel and dimed since I'm not really car savvy, but Mike was great. There was another guy who was working on my car who I can't remember, but I absolutely will only come here. Decent prices and decent people!"}
{"input": "Fair food, fantastic patio, great patio, but always packed. The drinks, however, are AWESOME. My favorite? Tennessee stud - Moonshine, lemonade, splash of coke. If you're hungry, the Baltimore BLT is bacon and crab cakes. Sounds fine to me."}
{"input": "I dig totally dig this place!  This place has TONS of custom hand rolls and everyone I've tried was delicious! \n\nIf you like it raw is their motto, and yes I do like it raw!  Their fresh fish (sashimi) is delicious!  They have great cuts of fish, they have additional items on their menu if you're willing to try something different.  This place is a combo of Japanese and Korean dishes so they provide great options.\n\nI normally get take-out here which is always ready when they promise.  My casual go to sushi place."}
{"input": "This is actually by far one of my favorite restaurant where I can find what Mexican food taste like , service always friends for always amazing"}
{"input": "A++ \nI have to say, this place is great and one of the biggest reasons why is their bar staff. There is a bartender named \"Ally\". She is always kind and attentive. Everyone can be crammed at the bar, and the employees running around like their hair is on fire, and Ally still treats you like you're her only customer. \nCool vibe, great indoor and outdoor seating. Great addition to the Funk Zone.\nDefinitely go!!\nPS: Say hi to Ally for me :-)"}
{"input": "Very nice delivery driver. But very slow service. Sandwich was less than satisfactory. They still owe me a $17 refund from a month ago. There were no napkins with my order. I am just teally disappointed."}
{"input": "This place is super cute! I love how sustainable they are. Definitely recommend. The people are awesome and pretty! Not to mention the food and coffee are extraordinary!"}
{"input": "Rooms were better than expected judging by the exterior of hotel.  Great food in casino.  Great service all around.  Casino is way to smokey to the point it was hard to breathe."}
{"input": "My wife and I went here for Devour Downtown.  It is a pretty sweet deal.  You chose an appetizer, two entrees, and a dessert for $30.  We also tried the fried Mac and Cheese, it was pretty incredible.  They have Sun King on tap, so that is worth a start alone.  The pizza is consistent and pretty delicious.  The service was pretty good.  I think we would go again."}
{"input": "Underrated burger alert!!\n\nRandomly came into Pag's during a stroll around Doylestown. The menu wasn't super appealing, actually, so I just went with a cheeseburger. Legitimately, one of the best cheeseburgers I've had in a while! Tasted like a quality Big Mac! Patty wasn't too thick, bun didn't overshadow the burger and whatever sauce they used - YUM.\n\nWe were in the wine bar section - ambiance is really nice; def not very kid friendly (we had our son with us.) but staff was friendly and accommodating.\n\nWe will totally be back next time we are in the mood for a good burger!"}

{"input": "2 thumbs down. I Went there for my 1st ever  manicure. Another customer came in 20 minutes after I did, no appoint. either. She was there for gel manicure. 5 minutes later the girl sits us both down, then proceeds to start working on getting her set up with gel manicure. She was on her way back to me, and a lady comes in for an unscheduled eyebrow wax. She tells me it's going to be a few more minutes so she could wax her. So she was going to help 2 unscheduled women who came in after me. That's bad business. So I got up and left. They clearly don't need my business."}
{"input": "I love Sam's. The staff is wonderful. The cooks are the greatest. \n\nThe half bbq chicken with stuffing and mashed sweet potatoes is in the top 3 of my all time favorite meals. Along with in-n-out and Rojo's beer battered cod tacos. You should go just to try the sweet potatoes. Everything on the menu is good and reasonalby priced. One of Sam's owners opend Devil's Alley in the city so if you've been there expect even better and cheaper here. So what if it's not as hip on a crowded city street?  The time you spend looking for a parking spot you coulda drove the 20 minutes to jenkintown and parked here with ease."}
{"input": "I'll give this place 3 stars until another trip to check out other items.\n\nThey did an ok job on the buildout.  Pretty nice for Vietnamese restaurant standards.  Owner and staff seem friendly.\n\nHappened to be there for happy hour so I tried the Vietnamese pork tacos and Vietnamese crepe.\n\nThe tortillas for the two tacos were stale but the pork was good and fresh vegetable fillings.  $4\n\nThe vietnamese crepe was AWFUL.  I'm not sure if it is the way it was prepared or if I just hate Vietnamese crepes.  It was like an undercooked eggy tasting omelet with tons of cold bean sprouts and thinly sliced cold shrimp and other grossness.  This could have been a delicious example of a Vietnamese crepe, I just might not like them...  - $5\n\nWe also ordered pork egg rolls.  Ok.\n\nI would go back to try other menu items."}
{"input": "Omg you would think that the drinks would be strong so that you wouldn't notice how bad the food is but no such luck. Capirihinias taste like dishwater. Coconut shrimp were burned and the fried avocado was a gloppy mess. Never. Again."}
{"input": "Would have never, EVER expected a place to be off the beaten path like this.  I was actually a little concerned when my cousin drove me over here but, I love homey places such as this. So I walked in told them I was dying of hunger and they came out were very friendly and went ahead and gave us the standard chips and water. Perfect, now everything is getting better because I have something to coat my stomach...I don't need anything special so I just ask the waiter where the enchiladas are without really looking at the menu and says \"2 enchiladas coming up\".  I love it.  Then I looked over and saw someone that had margaritas -- and I really really wanted one but I was trying to not drink that night.  Man, Michas delivered and they gave me extra fillers to fatten me up.  I walked out feeling good about this experience and I will absolutely go back here again. Legit 4 estrellas."}
{"input": "I have mix feelings about this place. First, I didn't make a reservation and we waited about 50 minutes to be seated when they told us it will be about 15 to 20 min wait. I probably should'v left and tried the next time since I was not happy when I was seated due to the waiting.\n\nI knew I couldn't eat the full-course meal so we decided to get cheese fondue and one of their entrees. Cheese fondue was delicious. If I go next time, I would probably just get the cheese fondue. =]\n\nAnd the entree we had.. was some chicken, meat, shrimp, mushrooms, etc. We decided to go with oil instead of broth because that's what our waitress suggested and I didn't really like it. I think I will try the broth next time if I do and see if I like it any better. Except the mushroom with stuffing, others were ok.\n\nWe had this private booth which was very romantic and nice. I think this place would be good for people who want privacy and have plenty of time for dinner. We stayed there for 2&1/2 hours excluding the waiting time."}
{"input": "Gypsy Saloon is and has always been one of my favorite restaurants outside of the city. Kim and Marianne are the owners and are totally hands on. Their menu is so fun and amazing. They are always consistent with their food and it has always been my \"go to\". Food is always fresh. The lobster mac and cheese is second to none. A fabulous restaurant not to be missed. Fabulous Brunch, lunch and dinner. You will not be disappointed.....EVER!!!!!"}
{"input": "What's all the fuss about?  Food is mediocre at best , service was marginal. You are allocated a table with a notice that you have 1. 1/2 hours st your table. Table crammed into a corner with a very obstructed view of the music. \nThis place is highly  overrated."}
{"input": "I love the decorations here! I've been here a few times. Most recently, I went with my father to try the croissants and lavender latte. The lavender latte was way too sweet. I liked the lavender taste, but the extreme sweetness ruined it. It was still too sweet after I diluted it with water, so I threw the drink away.  The croissants were okay (too dense for my taste). They had good flavor, and somehow tasted better the day after. I liked the stuffing of the spinach feta croissant, but the croissant itself was too dense and not buttery. The ham and cheese croissant was delicious. The Nutella croissant was okay (good flavor but the croissant was hard and didn't have enough filling). The butter croissant was too dense with texture more like a bread roll rather than a flaky croissant. The almond croissant lacked flavor.\n\nIn the past, I've ordered a green tea latte (that I hated- it just wasn't a flavor that fit my preferences) and a mocha (that was good)."}
{"input": "So seen all the great reviews about this place figured it was as good as it seemed so went there food was great service was great but while waiting for dessert we seen a mouse scurry out of the kitchen then ran around under a couple tables in the dining room then made it back to the kitchen and our waitress seen it and was very embarrassed she acknowledge it and we paid and left don't think I'll be going back!!"}
{"input": "I ordered late at night a cheese steak w/ fried onions and it was really the blandest meat ive tasted in a while. seemed like frozen steak with absolutely no flavor and had a rubbery texture. The order can on time and was correct but i decided not to eat it because it was so bad..."}
{"input": "The worst... Food was cold and tasteless.  We thought we were eating week old leftovers.  When this place closes, I hope the guys from Zaynas will take it over so we can have a good place to go in this part of town."}
{"input": "I find this place so-so at best. They have limited pizza. The Italian food is just ok. Service is good. Lots of parking. I find it pricey for what you get. I'm just not a fan. Lots of better Italian places to eat in the Reno/ Sparks area."}
{"input": "What's not to like about Mr. Wizard's?  It's definitely a different feel than the other ice cream places around, the crowd's a little more bizarre, and the location (Dogtown-ish) is significantly more convenient for me and my friends.\n\nI came here for the first time the other night and definitely expected not to be wowed, but dammit if it wasn't GOOD!  I ordered a specialty flavor-- \"The Wizard\"-- which was chock full of brownies, nuts, I think, and strawberries.  The medium size was bigger than I expected, and it ran me about $5.00, so next time, I'll go for a smaller size.\n\nI like Mr. Wizard's, and I'll definitely be back.  I like the casual neighborhood feel, the thicker, different taste of the custard, and the fact that the location is right.\n\nJust one question: Who IS Mr. Wizard?"}
{"input": "The service here was great. Someone greeted me as soon as I walked in, the guy who took my order was very friendly, and the person who cleared my table asked me if I needed a refill or was just in general very cheery.\n\nNot too impressed with the food though. The cucumber salad was delicious, so make sure you order that as your side - but admittedly it's a dish that's kind of hard to screw up. The wrap I got tasted okay, but it tasted like it was made in a microwave (not sure, maybe it was). In general the food reminded me of a mediterranean version of Panera. I don't like Panera either, so if you think the food there is awesome maybe you will like this place more than I did. The best way I can think to describe it is like the food you might get on a fancy mediterranean airline. It was edible and had some nice flavors, but just wasn't great. Without the very friendly service, I would have given this place 2 stars."}
{"input": "I love coming here for breakfast and service is always great. My food is always good. It can get busy on the weekends so get there early."}
{"input": "Cool laid back atmosphere, nice draft selection. A little inconsistent on the mixed drinks though.\n\nOrdered a Ketel 1 and cranberry, it was ok. Just your average drink. Ordered another, got a full glass of ketel 1 with a splash of cran, it  was OK .  I prefer consistency over being under served or given alcohol poisoning any day. \n\nI will be back, I am sure the newness kinks will be worked out soon!"}
{"input": "I have already written one review for Keith's, but just have to add more information! These guys are the best mechanics in the area. I have been coming here for years, and I am always amazed at their honesty, kindness and professionalism. Case in point: I recently purchased a classic car, that had some issues. Keith's repaired what they could, but the car ended up needing a classic car specialist for some additional work. Not only did Katie, at Keith's recommend a specialist for the job, she actually DROVE MY CAR to the other shop, and explained, in detail, the issues. That kind of service is exemplary, and so rare these days. I will always bring my car to Keith's, for they are simply and totally the best!!!"}
{"input": "Best place in Reno ans Sparks for kids swimming lessons.  Tons of personal attention and they really spend time teaching kids to swim technically correct"}
{"input": "Delicious place with super fresh ingredients. I love their stir fry because there's so many different options for topping. However, I took off two stars because the service at this particular location is really inconsistent and the same foods don't always taste the same. They also tend to run out of certain additions pretty often. Other than that love everything else about Honeygrow and it's definitely worth a shot."}
{"input": "I like this Sam's Club because it is in an excellent location and has great prices ranging from Gas, Liquor, Food, and Electronics, Tires etc etc. Their warranties are also great and are not difficult to take advantage of when you need it. I love that I can go in there and spend less than 20 dollars and have a dish for a party that will serve well over 10 people. I also like that I can drive 2-3 extra blocks and find gas significantly cheaper. For example today the gas was approx 3.70-3.79 on 86th street. I drove a few miles down the road and got gas for 3.51 there. That is extremely well worth it when you are in a budget and drive an SUV. The gas alone is worth the membership. The only reason I gave them a 4 star rating and not a 5 is because for all the hard work they do they could pay their employees a bit more. Additionally their lines tend to get a bit long at times which can be nerve-wracking especially when there are employees who want/need extra hours. Other than that kudos from me."}
{"input": "Ok this is an aberration from my city foodie reviews but I figured I'll take the time and review some of the local establishments that I order from on a consistent base while working in Bensalem, P.A.  Without further adieu...\nGeorge's Chix is good.  I'm always satisfied with the food and value each and every time.  I haven't branched out seeking much more than a good deal each time and trust me I'm not looking to find the healthiest option on the menu (usually I get the nugget/fries/soda deal, the chix fingers/fries/soda deal, or Ceasar wrap/fries/soda deal- $8 or $9 after a nice tip) but the food is alright.\nGive George's a try if you're in town and looking to get down on some fried grub!"}
{"input": "I love this place. The jambalaya is as good as you will get around these parts - chicken and smoked sausage goodness. The gumbos differ each week. The Mac and cheese is out of this world. The Tomatoe soup with pesto and croutons is the best I ever tried. The shrimp po boy I ate today was fantastic. The one problem I had today was service from the young woman who worked the counter. I asked for a soda. She ignored me. Twice. I gave her my po boy order and she didn't put it in. The guy who sat down next to me 10 minutes after I arrived got his order first so I checked to see whet my sandwich was and learn it wasn't even turned in. The problem is the food is so good I have no choice but to put up with this employee who doesnt seem to care.. Everyone else is great."}
{"input": "This place was as quaint as can be, right in the middle of Doylestown inside the Doylestown Inn. The vibe is pretty cool with a speakeasy touch- mirrors and chandeliers hanging around for sale. Service was excellent, food came out super fast and was delicious!! We made reservations ahead and they had our table ready 10 mins before we got seated. Ordered our drinks and food and it took maybe 10 mins before the food was out. The arugula salad with chipotle shrimp and goat cheese was amazing!"}
{"input": "The fried green tomato BLT is amazing!!! Great prices & awesome live music shows by Chris Caminiti & many awesome local artists & song writers."}
{"input": "I placed an order online to create my own pizza.  I get a call from them minutes after I placed my order saying they are out of 3 of the toppings that I wanted on my pizza.  When I got the pizza delivered, it was not even edible because there was way too much cheese and the dough was SO thin towards the middle it would just fall apart where we couldn't even pick the pizza up.  It was a sloppy mess and we couldn't even eat it.  Very disappointing."}
{"input": "Another great time and another great meal. Service fantastic and all foods from apps to entrees were exceptional yet again. Don't miss this one and be sure to try one of the lamb dishes, the shank entree excellent."}
{"input": "Getting to really like the Trident! Bar server Cody did it All!! She was helpful, efficient and friendly! Good combination!  Fried dill pickles complimented the Arrogant Bastard and Cold Snap my husband hD. We have to come back for a Real meal!! Happy Hour prices also helped!"}
{"input": "Ask for Alyssa!  \n\nShe did my hair for my wedding as well as some of my bridesmaids, everyone looked beautiful.  She knows hair well and is great at color too, she's my favorite for any kind of updo, cut, or color.  Highly recommended!"}
{"input": "Probably the best gay bar in Indy.  No smoking indoors, nice long deck out back, darts, pool tables, videos, generally a nice mixed crowd, bingo on Tuesday, country dancing on Fridays (early).  The owner tends to keep things up and constantly make it a little nicer."}
{"input": "Sadly it is closed now after 62 years.  It was a very fine store and Sid Hirsch is a very fine man, and a super athlete who used to do the ultra extreme rim to rim Grand Canyon trek."}
{"input": "Don't think twice. Come to Heffe and order the hot dog sandwich. It's a hot dog, butterflied and grilled, on a bun with the most bonkers flavors and textures. Extremely messy. Insanely tasty. Oh God, so good."}
{"input": "Cute little stop on the pier. The view of the city at night is beyond beautiful. Their wine tasting options are great for the wine newbies, like myself. The employees are very friendly and helpful choosing the right wines to try."}
{"input": "Service was horrible, the men never made eye contact with me, it took them 10 minutes to get to me when there was only 3 people in the room. I did however get a good deal on my tires"}
{"input": "This place is quick with your dry cleaning but man is it expensive! The location is close to our place, so it makes it convenient, and I must admit like I said above they are super quick at getting your things cleaned. I always keep my eye out for coupons they deliver to our home and those come every couple months - they make my trip to the dry cleaner significantly less expensive! \n\nThe staff are there to do there job and that's apparent, there is no idle chit chat - it's get in get out, let's get down to businesses. \n\nEverything I've had cleaned here has been done well so I have no complaints and would recommend this place to friends in the future!"}
{"input": "The Opa! at WEM is worlds apart from the others; definitely the best Greek fast food spot in town. I get the #5 with the pita wrap and French Fries - yes, French fries. Not very Greek, I know. But seriously, these are no McCain potato sticks. They're close to the best I've ever had. You can also get a mean fried calamari plate here. Who knew?! \n\nI don't think the one on Whyte even serves appies like that. This franchise is run by Francis, a super sweet lady who takes pride in keeping a very clean restaurant. It has more the feel of an intimate little restaurant than a fast food chain. When I feel like Opa! I head to WEM. Their pita bread is so yummy and fresh and their tzatziki is to die for."}
{"input": "A coworker took me to lunch here; this was my first time visiting a Firehouse Subs restaurant. The restaurant was clean, and the servers were very friendly and attentive. My sandwich (meatball) was served promptly and was very fresh and hot. The wheat bread was awesome. They have one of the new pop machines that lets you pick from several dozen flavors. The variety of subs leans to the healthy side. They have only white and wheat bread. There is a slight bit of uniqueness to their subs, but mostly they are pretty standard (more like Subway than like Which Wich). I think the price for a medium sub and drink is a bit high: $9. A great place to eat for a change up on sandwiches."}
{"input": "This is a great place to bring the kids to. They can have juice, a slice of cake, and homemade popsicles. They think it is a tea party. I have tried everything once and my favorites are the homemade doughnuts filled with read bean, the popsicles, the patbingsu, and even the good ol' coffee cream and sugar."}
{"input": "This place used to be good but it's gone down hill a lot lately. It's very small inside so you are hard pressed to go there for dinner and not have a wait, a long one. Their selection of sushi is limited and the last time we were there we were not impressed and we probably won't go back. There are other sushi restaurants in the area that are much better."}
{"input": "There are so many wonderful things to say about this hotel:\n\n1. Free Wi-Fi\n2. Free Shuttle Downtown\n3. Free Snacks\n4. Cute Greeting (Post Card, Guitar Picks and Goo Goo Cluster)\n5. Uber Helpful Staff (We had to leave a night early due to weather and they worked with Hotels.com to make sure we weren't charged)\n\nReally, how many hotels offer 1 of the items listed above for free, much less 3/3?\n\nThe room was also very clean and stocked with a Keurig, fridge and microwave. It wasn't anything fancy, but did the trick just fine. The room was what I expected to encounter for a 3 star hotel. Clean, fairly updated and nice enough.\n\nThe downsides were proximity to a major street and the noise that comes with it and the fact that I couldn't get the TV to work (though I didn't try too hard and we didn't ask for help).\n\nI'd go back for the reasons listed above as well as for the proximity to many attractions (Hint-Walk to Hattie B's a couple of blocks away for a tasty and inexpensive meal)."}
{"input": "When the boss is away, the kids will take a little bit longer lunch hour and venture to Broad Ripple to eat somewhere they've wanted to try for a long time!  I can't believe I didn't make it here sooner.\n\nI don't know which I liked better, the owner or the ham croqueta sandwich.  He was super friendly, making sure to talk to everyone and was happy he didn't have to deport anyone for not liking his food, which I don't think is possible.\n\nThe sandwich was bigger than I expected and loaded.  There was more ham on it than I normally eat at Christmas dinner, yet at the end, I was somehow wanting more.  The black bean soup was the perfect side dish.  Pro tip: check out coupons4indy.com before you go!\n\nCan't wait til next time!"}
{"input": "Amazing food and Amazing service! They know what they are doing! It tastes super authentic and you get that good home cookin meal you always are craving! I will recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"input": "Not really the town you would expect to find a great Indian restaurant, but figured I'd give it a shot.\nI'm picky about Indian food, and all I can say is WOW it's good!\nThe Naan with peach chutney was amazing.\nThe Lamb Korma was perfect. Perfect amount of spice (too many Indian restaurant set your mouth on fire and you can't enjoy the taste). Not too much, not too little.\nThe rice and lamb was perfectly cooked. Very authentic.\n\nThe decor is very nice (those chairs in the front are impressive) and staff very friendly. Service was also very quick.\n\nI'm relocating to Tampa, and might actually have to make the drive from there a few times to come back. Very impressive!\n\nI would definitely recommend this place, even if it's a bit of a drive.  It's worth it."}
{"input": "A definite go-to place if you're in Treasure Island! Love the char-grilled oysters!  Great staff!  Big outdoor seating area and best yet, it's pet friendly so bring your pup!!!  Coming from Austin where pets are accepted everywhere this is a real bonus for me!"}
{"input": "Love love love.     This place us a great vibe with an authentic feel!!   The free coffee is a major plus!    Definitely need to come back!"}
{"input": "Great local craft brewery in Mercer County and is certainly much larger compared to their original Lambertville location. The new venue is clean, organized, and very much resembles the layout of Allagash Brewery in Portland, Maine, for anyone that has been to that one. RH is expanding at an alarming rate due to the great quality of their beers, especially their Summer Blonde which is extremely refreshing. Their beers are all unfiltered as opposed to other local craft breweries such as Yards and Flying Fish were are filtered. In order to sample, you must take the tour because of New Jersey law, be sure to make a reservation and do not drink too much because Ewing PD is literally next to the brewery."}
{"input": "State Street Kitchen of Newtown, PA - a fantastic experience of warmth and engagement and yes, the breakfast was nicely done and affordable. The owner, upon presenting the menu said, if you don't see what you want simply ask. I asked her favorite and she prepared a special omelette. \n\nThe outside looks like a piece of crap but the inside was quaint and professional. Misha, the owner, shared a selfie with me and one of the patrons came over to our table, after he finished his meal, and jawboned with us about the local community lore. \n\nTrue engagement, Priceless!  I will be back.\n\nJoe Wesley of Bergen County, NJ"}
{"input": "Awesome little dessert place with teeny little cupcakes (think portion control if you're dieting) and HUGE slices of cake if you're not dieting. They also have dessert bars, too. They serve coffee, tea, wine and beer. Table service was a nice surprise. Prices were reasonable for what you get. Coffee was very good - and refills on the house. It was a little loud with all the tables and counter seats full - kind of made it hard to hold a conversation with my friend without shouting at each other. If it weren't for that, I would have given a 5 star rating. Other than that, it was awesome! Be sure to try a salted caramel bite...or 2...or 3! They even have a \"pupcake\" you can buy for your puppy...nice touch for dog lovers!"}
{"input": "This restaurant is over rated. My family went because we were new to the area and have heard great things. They are very packed, hardly any parking and you always have to make a reservation. I thought I would be happy with the food. However, when we went for dinner the menu had some food that sounded good, but my husband and I struggled to find something that we liked. We did get the California roll and that was good, but we were not impressed with the teriyaki chicken. It seems like our experience is one of the few, but personally we will not be going back again."}
{"input": "Fun stop. Service was subpar. Ordered the adult orange sundae- description was mesmerizing on the menu, presentation and taste a little lackluster. But, all of the actual food was delicious. My grilled cheese (add apples and turkey) was divine- kale salad a nice touch. Everyone else had great meals too- pesto chicken sandwich, even my daughters pb&j.  But this place is all about the kitsch factor- keep your expectations in check and ignore the sour puss servers and you'll enjoy the visit. Ask for one of the soap opera booths :)"}
{"input": "My grandmother has been going to this place for years, since her mother used to take her...\n\nI bought my husband's wedding band here, they sized it quickly and brought it out to my car so I didn't have to pay the meter in downtown Tampa.\n\nGreat service, great prices, great history. Fantastic shop!"}
{"input": "Just tried this place for the first time today and I'm so sad because I've been living here for four years and now I'm just discovering it! Super fresh breads, ingredients, home made soups, similar to fife and dekel but without the pies. Reasonably priced, and it's got a Grandma's sandwich shop feel to it (in the best way possible). I got a Montreal meat sandwich and the pastrami barley soup, both were SO good and I can't wait to come back here again!!"}
{"input": "Began with a problem with the drinks and rather than just take care of it, the waiter said he was sending over a manager who never showed up. We cancelled the drink order and ordered something different. The food took forever and the waiter was running around like a chicken with his head cut off. He rarely checked on us.  On a positive note, the food was very good! We asked for a box for the left overs and the check, I handed the waiter my card and was expecting a quick return, only to hear him talk to the table behind us that he gave them our tab. He of course involved a manager (probably the one we never saw regarding the drinks) to correct the ticket. This process took forever and I had to get another waiter to finally get my to go box. Obviously I will be checking my statement closely to make sure I was charged properly and not twice. Because of all the screw ups and delays we missed the movie we were planning to see. Needless to say, we won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"input": "Just recently ate here for the first time. The hype was real. My girlfriend had the Greek Salad while I ordered the Chickpea Vegetarian Pita and they were kind enough to allow for some substitutions. The food was on point and portions were very filling and satisfying. Great staff and environment. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"input": "My go to place in East Nashville!\nThree suggestions. \n1. Serve enough fries. \n2. Offer pita with meals, salads and soup\n3. More chicken and orzo in the soup\nThanks."}
{"input": "Holy _____! Good rolls. Great service. Good prices. Lots of healthy options. Try the sushi. It worth every penny!"}
{"input": "Delicious, low price, and less rice! Amazing rolls, wide variety and very cheap for all you can eat for lunch, $15.99, can't beat that deal. They use less rice for each roll so you don't get full as fast and are not forced to break the roll in 2. Highly recommended."}
{"input": "Good food and great service.  Enjoyable dining experience."}
{"input": "Not value for money. Quantity is very less as compared to the price paid.\n\nOverall Ok restaurant."}
{"input": "Wow. From friendly owner/staff to huge portions of sushi and udon... I'm a very full and happy girl. We needed carry out sushi since one of my kid fell asleep. Decided on this place thanks to all the Yelp reviews even though it was 20 mins away vs the closer sushi joints nearby. \n\nWe ordered: spicy salmon hand rolls, Nelson, dale and Corey, Arizona, sashimi appetizer, veg udon, miso soup. \n\nLove love love that they let you customize the level of spicy in your rolls. Yum!! Everything was extremely yummy. My favorite was the hand roll and the D&C. I just wished someone had warn me about the size of this overly loaded spicy salmon hand roll. It was huge and salmon in every bite.  The flavor in the D&C was soooooo perfect. Although, I had wish I asked to make it extra hot. I like my food spicy hot. It was a great last night in FL kinda meal."}
{"input": "Not impressed with this location.we to the drive thru yesterday to get a wonderful shake. The lady was taking one order at a time i mean you order you drive to pay and then when that vehicle leaves the property then the next person goes thru the same process kinda reminded me of when employees are not getting what they want so they cause a slow down. ..so I went inside thinking I'd get faster service it was 92 degrees on a Saturday night. Went inside a customer said they only have a total of 2 employees working here needless to say I didn't get my shake..I went back t h e next day today Sunday and ordered my shake I was told they were out of shakes.i asked when they would have more the lady said she didn't know. ."}
{"input": "Came here after my husband bought home their lemon pepper wings. They have plenty of flavors. Ranging from ones you've heard of (lemon pepper, mild) to New Orleans flavors (yaka mein, noonie bird). They also have their drinks. The watermelon is to die for. I don't know what they put in it but lord help them. The location isn't the best but they're trying to put something back in the community. It's in the same section with the daiquiri shop so it's really not that bad during the day. I probably wouldn't come at night by myself. Definitely give this place a try. Hey you might even see Skip."}
{"input": "This place used to be much worse but the food has gotten better and the place renovated so the atmosphere is better."}
{"input": "Pros: it tasted like Pizza\nCons: the dough was frozen and the crust was thicker than most places.  It was a disappointing to say the least.  \nBottom line: It was lower tier pizza, Actually Costco pizza was a little better and cheaper."}
{"input": "Terrible service at this Domino's... They don't seem to have the ability to fulfill orders promptly and correctly."}
{"input": "This place has dabomb.com Alfredo Nachos #sogood. Great service every time my girlfriend and I go! Favorite place whenever we go to Nashville. Highly recommend"}
{"input": "Best Onion Rings in Santa Barbara/Goleta!!! Rare combination of friendly service, good burgers and reasonably priced (Charburger for $1.99 on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday)  The service and friendly staff always have me coming back!!"}
{"input": "This is my favorite coffee shop! Love the atmosphere and the coffee and food are excellent! If you go for breakfast - you have to try the bacon biscuit sandwich! Whenever we come to Tampa to visit, this is at the top of our list on where we have to stop!"}
{"input": "If you're a sushi connoisseur then this place is not for you. I, however absolutely love it. Sam's very strict on the procedures but that's what makes the shop so efficient and popular. It's in downtown so you have to find parking along the street. Sushi is sooooo cheap and I can basically get full spending $3. Drinks are available; limited seating and if it's too busy he'll just tell you so and expect you to either wait half an hour or leave. He's an awesome guy though. Go there, check it out, and enjoy!"}
{"input": "I was really feeling for coffee and was nowhere near a Starbucks, so I decided to stop at this Tim Hortons. I was immediately impressed with how clean the store was. I have never been to a Tim Hortons before and Maryann was super sweet and spent a lot of time explaining the menu. The iced coffee that I eventually decided on was perfect! You guys have got yourselves a new regular!"}
{"input": "Went here with 4 other people for our friend's birthday and it was great!! Our waitress was very friendly and the food was incredible (I got the carnitas tacos). Definitely bring your own tequila and get a pitcher of Mango margaritas- awesome! I'll definitely be coming back here."}
{"input": "I love getting delivery from here! I agree with the other posts that if you dine inside, the service is hit ir miss but they're pizza is great and delivery has always been punctual"}
{"input": "THE BEST tacos in tampa!! Authentic! \nMy wife and I ate here when we first moved to Tampa in Dec 2016. For the life of us, we could NOT remember the name or location. \nWE FOUND IT!!!!"}
{"input": "I'm 100% omnivore but um....HCV's sweet potato fries with sriracha aioli will. blow. your. mind. \n\n\"Sriracha aioli,\" you think, \"....yawn.\" No, no - this aioli is otherworldly. The fries are perfectly done, and the combo of them with the aioli is incredible. \n\nThis is all I've ever had from HCV to be honest (multiple times though). And it is enough for me to give 5 stars!"}
{"input": "I have to say that I was really impressed with this place. I had heard about it here on Yelp and decided I should try it. I ordered the ranch fried chicken and the indian cinnamon donut and both were very good. I also had what I would call their plain donut and it was delicious. The donuts were moist and warm and extremely tasty and were probably the best I have ever had. The chicken was tender and moist and also delicious.\nThe only downside to this place is the size. The restaurant is very small and there is very little seating. The seating is diner style, stools at a counter. This would be a great place for takeout, which they do.\n\nOverall I would definitely recommend going here. I would also recommend going early as they tend to sell out fairly quickly in the mornings."}
{"input": "Definitely one of the best beer selections I have seen in many places. The wings were delicious all of the food that I saw go by looks to be very good. Mostly I was there for the beer selection and the wings.  It is a good place that offers a variety of seating and the employees seem to enjoy working there for the most part. I have very good service from the bartender."}
{"input": "This place is great, definitely one of our fall-back places when we want to go out.\n\nReally love the ambiance- they've remodeled in the past couple years and it looks nice! \n\nThe sushi itself is great- it's consistently tasty and the fish is fresh and delicious.  If you're craving sushi, this is the place to go! Also, they have some really unique rolls (my favorite is the Orange Dragon... YUM!!) and the prices are decent!\n\nAs for the teriyaki and non-sushi dishes, they are great as well. The only thing is every once in a while the chicken is a little over cooked and crispy... kind of a bummer.  Overall, the portions are BIG and very satisfying. \n\nService is great, and prices are fine, considering it's sushi. Love it here and come regularly!"}
{"input": "BuBinga is the pop/top40 lounge/club in El Dorado. It's located right in front of the buffet entrance. I like that the attire is more strict, so you don't have fools tryna walk in with flip-flops and t-shirts. The line gets really long especially on Saturdays. Door opens at 10 & a line had already formed around 9:40. I would say that Saturdays are way more crackin then Fridays. & cover was ridiculous.. not free before a certain time & not free for girls... it was $10 or $20\n\nMusic on the Friday I went was ok.. mostly dance pop with some mixed-in random rock, hip-hop, house.. music was ok.. \n\nThe crowd is really chill, mostly late 20's, 30's and even 40's.... friendly people who just wanna get drunk & have a fun time\n\nHonestly, being 22 & LOVING hip-hop, I would recommend AURA LOUNGE. It's just down stairs in Silver Legacy. & they have NO COVER CHARGE."}
{"input": "The best auto service experience I've ever encountered! This family-run business really takes care of your vehicles AND you. They'll even pick up and drop off your car or truck if you make an appointment. Their work is excellent and they're friendly with competitive prices.\n\nTake your vehicles to Buckley's for a first-class service experience."}
{"input": "Oh no..I may have a new obsession. \n\nMy experience with the bella buffalo sandwich was truly amazing. The sauce was delicious and flavorful, the mushroom fried golden to perfection. Just the perfect amount of crunch and it held up to the sauce and other toppings.  I also don't know where they get their bread, but the roll was also fresh and yummy. I devoured my whole sandwich in less than ladylike time (and demeanor). \n\nWill 100% be back."}
{"input": "Converted building exceeds Embassy Suite/Hilton Standards\nLocated close to the airport in an area with apartment/condominiums, the property is a converted property with a Hilton/Embassy Suite Stamp so it does not have usual open atrium.  As a result, the rooms seems like they were converted from single bedroom apartments - my room was spacious with a kitchenette.  Staff from check in to the breakfast are outstanding.\n\nPro:\n* Hilton standards, bed, linen, great breakfast\n* Gym - located next to the pool, Precor equipment with two adjustable benches, dumbbells 5-50 pounds, two Ellipticals, two threadmills, multi-functional machine\n\nMinus:\n* Pay for parking, $8 self-parking and $15 valet\n* Manager's Reception area is small\n\nWould I return?  Maybe.  The convenience to the airport and MacDill AFB makes it great, but paying for parking will make me look for other properties without having to pay for parking."}
{"input": "This is my favorite nail shop in the city I've been going here for years....I enjoy the quiet serene atmosphere...the staff is very friendly and efficient....the price of $25.00 for a pedicure in the South....you can't beat it!"}
{"input": "Order on a piece of paper, pay at the front, and keep walking to pick your order: Fast service!!\n\nHad the cheese and chips. Can't let the cheese sit too long but it is pretty good.\n\nHad the Beef Enchilada plate. It was pretty good. The beans are a bit dry and the rice could be hard so just focus on the enchiladas because they are good and you will enjoy it.\n\nSoda fountain so drink to your heart's content."}
{"input": "This place is seriously hit or miss. The last time I was there the bbq was really under-par, the ribs were really tough, the sausage was mediocre at best, and the potatoe salad was just plain gross. Thankfully - that's what was on my boyfriend's plate, not mine. \n\nThe enchiladas on the other hand were amazing as always. I wish I could buy the enchilada sauce so I could put it on everything, plus the fried egg on top (which I first thought was a very odd addition) is cooked to perfection with a beautifully running yoke. Although I still think it's a little annoying that if you order them with a meat it comes on the plate almost like a side, the dish is still my favorite.\n\nPlus the happy hour is pretty on point - half off on margarita pitchers that aren't scrimping on the booze, sounds good to me."}
{"input": "A tad pricey for what it offers. For example you get a side of sauces about 1 oz really not enough to use for much dipping, extra sauce is 50 cents really? It cost two cents to make. I have been here a couple times, the portion size is small for the price. The chicken is really pretty smokey flavor if thats what you like. I don't know how peruvian it is besides the smoking on a rotisserie"}
{"input": "There's been three times that I've ordered a green tea lemonade and got a peach tea lemonade and had to turn all the way back and go inside and have theme remake it."}
{"input": "This place is always awesome. Their fried chicken is great and so is their fried fish. It's hard to decide what to get when you go but do yourself a favor and get the buffalo chicken sandwich on a bun at least once. You could eat there if you wanted to but it's really more of a to go type of place. Don't get intimidated if there is a lot people there when you go. They put out food fast and accurate."}
{"input": "Just had a great experience. We all had the 3 for $10 meal. \nthe baked potato soup. Southwest soup. Bacon cheeseburger. Sirloin steak w/ mashed potatoes. All of it was impressive for the price we paid. Our drinks were on the table before the waiter was done taking our order. Service today was outstanding. No room for dessert, we all agreed that we want to come back & bring friends so they can have a good time with good food & good peeps."}
{"input": "I am a frequent Sunday School attendee and Wash West is my location of choice. The staff is amazing, the selection is perfect. \n\nWith so many options being available in Philadelphia and so many new places to try, I am still always going to return to Tria regularly. Great beers, cheeses, wine, food, service, everything. Perfect for any time of the day or occasion."}
{"input": "After a 4 year hiatus from Philly, I returned last night for a business trip, Chickie's & Pete's was a perfect place for a welcome back dinner.  Living in Seattle, we eat plenty of crab and seafood, so I immediately went for things we can't  get in the Pacific Northwest, which included 4 pints of Yuengling's, crab fries (fries with a wicked cheese/crab sauce), a cheesesteak, and lots of sports (witness the Sonics move to Oklahoma).  OK, this doesn't have quite the neighborhood charms of some of the classic Philly joints, but it sure is spacious, clean, efficient, and tasty."}
{"input": "This place is awesome! Best selection around, super friendly and knowledgeable staff and very reasonable prices. The bar is really nice and with 30 beers on tap (always 2 on nitro!) you can't beat it. Definitely the best craft beer store you will find in philly!"}
{"input": "A group of five went late in the evening and experienced poor service. The restaurant was clean and there are a lot of tv's to watch sports but not recommended for an enjoyable dining experience. The food was good but overpriced in my opinion. Also, gratuity is added to your ticket. We had a terrible waitress who got drink orders incorrect, forgot silverware, was completely\nunpleasant, and never checked on us."}
{"input": "I finally found Daisy after a series of bad hair cuts. She immediately diagnosed the problem and we talked about what styles work and don't work for my hair and face. Then she transformed my dysfunctional cut into an adorable low maintenance bob and I've never been happier. She is absolutely the best and I can't recommend her enough!"}
{"input": "on top of the ticket price you have to pay 10$ to park Heads up. \nThis place is awesome for what it is. The actors in the house are good. I was legitly spooked in every house except the 3d one the paint was too cool and trippy to be scared lol.its really cool like if i was to be murdered or mutilated it would be in a place like that. dark woods etc. also 7$bud light so of course pre game before hand. theres a house they can touch you in. the actors only grabbed girls/paid no attention to my boyfriend or any guys that i saw lol"}
{"input": "After moving to the area, Jungle Prada Tavern was one of the first places a friend took me.  The bartender made a great recommendation based on a beer I told her I liked and I loved it!  Now for the food- I LOVE seafood, so I am leary of ordering from places that don't do it justice, but alas, they impressed me thoroughly with all the seafood options I chose!!  The scallops prosciutto app, del mar pizza with crab and scallops, and crab stuffed portabella app (comes with a crab and lobster bisque- YUM) are all delicious!!  I also love the roasted portabella app- for a vegetarian option, it is delicious and was recomended by someone who isn't. I've actually gone back several times since then just to eat (obviously, I also drank ;) and took my sister when she was in town visiting (and is a seafood fanatic).  So all in all, give this place a chance!!  You will not be disappointed with the options!"}
{"input": "Amazing food! Papaya salad was spicy and good. Had fresh young coconut juice. On to the main course had the masaman curry. Perfect. No other words. Been to a ton of Thai restaurants in the USA and this ranks as my top"}
{"input": "The smell hits you as soon as you're near the door. Smells amazing! The Turkey Supreme is delicious and the Italian Beef is so flavorful and tender!"}
{"input": "I ate there for the first time today with my wife and 2 small kids. We ordered a pepperoni pie with extra cheese and sauce. I thought it was very good. They put a lot of garlic in their sauce which I liked a lot. I will definetly repeat."}
{"input": "Very affordable clothing and they're ALWAYS running sales. Very affordable, yet trendy, and has excellent customer service. The other stores in the same area are very pricey, so if you're are looking to \"dress up\" ;) on a budget, this is the place for you."}
{"input": "Love the food- wait staff is attentive to allergies and very accommodating. The drink pours are paltry at best. The bourbon tasted watered down...disappointing aspect to the dining experience."}
{"input": "One of my worst experiences. \nMike was totally rude on the phone.\nHe said I would better find someone else to fix my washer machine just because I said I was calling to know how much he would charge in advance. \nEven though he was totally mean over the phone, I asked my husband to call him back and ask him to see our problem. He came and was totally RUDE again and after 10 mim said he was never lucky with this kind of problem and would not fix it. \nNot professional. I would now trust on his services."}
{"input": "Dr. Curtis Dechant has an excellent chair-side manner, and he establishes a good rapport with his patients. The office is very comfortable, and the latest high-tech equipment makes eye appointments much easier to bear. I also appreciate their selection of eyeglass frames and the friendly staff."}
{"input": "I attended a meeting for the homebuilders Association of New Orleans here. The food was good and they took good care of the patrons. I had a mimosa which was good. I had a small cup of corn and crab soup which is fantastic but the portion was quite small. I had the grits and grillades and it was fantastic! The portion same grade on this one. The price was around $10. I've included a photo of the menu for your convenience. I didn't get a chance to test the Wi-Fi but I would say given the ambience and the quality of the food it's a repeat"}
{"input": "Excellent food and great people! I'm a fan. It is my new go-to lunch spot now. Thanks guys! Keep being awesome!"}
{"input": "Wow!!!!\n\nThis bakery is a must if you are in the St. Louis area! Great location, humble yet inspired recycled decor and the best sweets I have come across in a very long time! On our order...1) POPCORN COOKIE--most moist, buttery, popcorny cookie you ever had..delicious. 2) Salted Caramel cupcake..omgaahhhh..amazing. 3) Brownie--a small crunchiness on the outside and ooeeyy gooey chocolaty-ness on the inside that will leave you comparing it to any other browning you ever had and then you realize there is no comparison..just superb 4) Boston Creme Whoopie Pie--sooo yummy and deliciously put together. 5) A box of French Macaroons, made by a friend and sold in the bakery, 6 varieties in a box..heavenly..we ended up making this a community box where we all got one bite of each macaroon. The lavendar and orange ginger were my favorites! Too wonderful to NOT share."}
{"input": "Huge mall didn't get to see it all but what I did see was awesome. People were really nice. I will definitely visit again"}
{"input": "Not only was the food excellent, but the people here are beyond nice-and genuine. I had eggs Benedict. The poached eggs were good but the toast they were sitting on was excellent. We were given a cream pancakes to taste test by our awesome server, Tina. I can honestly say it was the best pancake I've ever tasted. So full of flavour-vanilla, and soft aa pillow.  They melted in my mouth. I didn't even use syrup. Stellar!"}
{"input": "One might want to skip the coffee's made in their machine. I had a cappuccino made twice and both times there were grounds in the bottom. I returned them!  I was told they are getting a new machine."}
{"input": "Pros:\n\n-Superb cheeseburger - thick, evenly cooked, (almost) medium rare, nice sauce, soft bun\n-Tasty (complimentary) zucchini bread\n-Good service\n-Good G+T selection\n-Cool ambience\n-Downstairs from my apartment\n\nCons:\n\n-Expensive\n-Per wife, the waitress \"seemed disappointed\" that we only ordered cheeseburgers (this was not verified, status as a \"con\" is under review)\n\nLooking forward to going back."}
{"input": "We thoroughly enjoyed this place. It has a great atmosphere and a great menu. The mushroom soup was amazing and the pizza sauce rocks. :)"}
{"input": "Food= Amazing\nService= Great\nPrices= Reasonable\n\nStop reading and start eating!"}
{"input": "Only had one experience with this place and it will be my last. I called in the night before to ask if they sell deboned duck and the man on the phone said they could but I would have to request it the day of. I called the following morning to ask to pick up a plain deboned duck and whoever the incompetent girl who answered had trouble getting my order clear. I picked up my order and came home to find that not only did they gave a whole duck with stuffing I never asked for. I called the place back and thy never offered any compensation of any sort except a trade in right as it's a hour before dinner time and the butcher shop is more than thirty minutes away for me. Shame that food from this place is overshadowed by their terrible customer service."}
{"input": "Terrible experience. Made two appointments for blowouts over a week in advance. Both appointments were for 4:00pm as we had a function to attend at 6:00pm. We arrived at 3:55 & were welcomed as we checked in, even offered a drink. 20 minutes later, we were still waiting. There are only 2 people that do blowouts & both had other clients in their chairs, which I assume we're walk-ins. At that point, we decided we had waited long enough & left to rush home & do our own hair. That was our first & last time trying this salon. As residents of St. Petersburg, there are plenty of other options & not honoring appointments is a bad sign in my book!"}
{"input": "Great grocery for for everyday items! \nUsually no wait for check out! \nFast counter should be more ready for items out of stock or need more prep time. I have waited more than most would for items that need to be made due to being sold out.\nClean & friendly staff! \n\nLeft Publix for this 1 location on grocery store. \n\nNow has a Tesla charging station."}
{"input": "Similar to below reviews I was not impressed at all after getting super excited about a new local bbq spot. You just simply can't call something \"pulled pork\" and then throw tough chewy cubes of tasteless meat onto a roll. I had to throw it away it was that bad. The redeeming quality? The sides- really nicely done fresh cut fries and Mac but come on Duke's - step up your game man as I want to see a local spot do well!!!"}
{"input": "Came here on a weekday afternoon after a city-wide bike tour.  It only hinted at the music-driven, cocktail party atmosphere that people tell you about.\n\nStill, this was a welcome rest stop for the afternoon with a couple of beers to replenish my strength before continuing on bike.\n\nA far cry from the hectic madness of the French Quarter, Bacchanal sort of gives you a glimpse of the less heralded, more local-y version of NOLA that's easy to miss for first time visitors like my wife and I."}
{"input": "This is my second trip to Indy and my second trip to 3 sisters. The food is amaze balls!\n\nThis trip I had the turkey melt on rye with onions cheese pesto etc. My taste buds were awaken to the most wonderful explosions of flavor!!!\n\nThe owner and staff were wonderful as well! \n\nWe will be back next year when visiting the folks."}
{"input": "This is the closest McDonald's to me. Always great hot fresh food. You may need to wait a little but it's worth it. Craziest thing, they don't leave out napkins. You need to ask. Other then that food is great."}
{"input": "OMG!  Seriously, some of these best cornbread I have ever had.  We discovered this family owned place during our last trip to the NO back in 2005.  It was so good we went back for 2 additional hits of their buttery cornbread.  It's crack I tellya, crack.  Why the hell else would I take a picture of it.   The fried seafood is really good too.  Go for lunch, if my memory is correct they have a different menu at lunch and I think they only serve their cornbread at lunch time."}
{"input": "Great place! Not a fan of the extensive use of straighteners, i'd rather just have a blow out without it, but they were extremely nice and quick!"}
{"input": "Absolutely horrible service, cold soup and my salad was drenched in dressing. The iceberg lettece was browning, soggy and pickled.  This place should not even get 1 star."}
{"input": "We visited at lunch time with our 17 year old son who insisted on the crocodile balls. Now I insist on the crocodile balls. I'm sure the bar scene is great, but back to that 17 year old son. We didn't get to visit in the evening. We did go back twice in two days though for more crocodile balls. Have I said that enough? CB from now on. Order them."}
{"input": "Cheapest city-wides this side of the Schuylkill. Do you need another reason to stop by this place on a Friday night? Everyone here is very friendly and welcoming. I wish their menu had more to offer, but the fries are steak fries and are also DELICIOUS."}
{"input": "As other have said, Great food, Great outdoor dining area, and decent prices.\nI love Carpinteria, and we have been eating here for some time.... sometimes for both lunch and dinner. \nThey also have some great beer on tap.\n\nSo why not a 5 star rating?\n\nNo Dogs allowed.\n\nHave you considered allowing pets in a certain area at least?"}
{"input": "Really disappointed - we were told we would be on a 45 min wait and after approaching the hostess 75 min through she told us we would be the next 2 top to be seated.  15 min later she sat a couple that was waiting right next to us that came 30 min after we did.  This is the second poor experience we've had here.  I don't normally write poor reviews but the hostess was so dismissive and rude on Mother's Day of all days and made no efforts to accommodate after having us wait for 90 min total."}
{"input": "Only came here since it was featured in US Weekly magazine as one of Taylor Swift's favorite places. This place was terrible. We ordered the pulled pork platter with a side of mac n cheese and slaw and the half ribs platter with a side of potato salad. Our order was wrong, the food was burned, the slaw had way too much vinegar, and the ribs were rock hard. I don't recommend this place at all."}
{"input": "Love, love, love that I found a trustful, great dentist in the area! Staff is GREAT and Dr. S is the best."}
{"input": "(Self) Verified Customer\n\nThanks Yelpers. This was a winner. The portions were generous. The fish excellent - few get excellent for the fish. Simply said - why eat sushi - for the fish. \nTuna,salmon, white tuna, yellow tail. Great\n\nSoup ok but not why I was there. Service good. Price - always spend too much with my teenage sushi loving companions but pricing was a bit lower than some others. \n\nHad a spicy tuna roll as well - good for a roll.  Companion had Fantasy Roll - it was very good. \nInteresting if straightforward layout. Clean."}
{"input": "This place is amazing! The food  meets every expectation. The staff is very friendly.  Sandy , our server , treated us like family . This is our go to place !"}
{"input": "Last time:  This is the second and last time my wife and I visit this place.  We were the ONLY table, yet it took the waitress at least 15 minutes to get our order.  From then our pizzas took about 45 minutes (they were both small).\n\nWhile waiting for our pizza I had to move us to the bar are a.  I couldn't stand listening to one of the other waitresses bitching about the place non-stop while our waitress was sweeping.  Her bitching was amplified in that echo chamber.\n\nAnd after all that waiting my pizza was barely warm.\n\nThis place has now earned a spot on my short list of PLACES TO AVOID."}
{"input": "For Cool Springs on a Thursday when Bonefish grill was packed this place had a comfortable wait of 15 minutes. Also the food is always amazing, but that's a given"}
{"input": "You know that really good authentic boudin that some New Orleanians drive to Lake Charles or Breaux Bridge to get for big gatherings?  Well, I got that delicious quality boudin this weekend without the long drive, I just took the new Rampart streetcar to the end and walked a couple of short blocks to Shank.  I also bought some sausage, can't wait to try it soon, and will be heading back often to stock up on the other meats. I had always enjoyed their prepared meals, but I'm especially excited to have such a terrific butcher nearby."}
{"input": "Quaint. It was perfect for breakfast. Service was right on the money - didn't crowd but was attentive."}
{"input": "This is a hidden gem! This is my first review but I had to give it 5 stars for the amazing crepes at a good price! I also had a delicious caramel milkshake. The crepes here are cheaper than the market and they don't come in a cone. When I come back to New Orleans I'll be coming here :) my mum and I really enjoyed it."}
{"input": "My wife and I have been coming into Josef's on the weekends for some time. Their baked goods are awesome. I like having them warmed and served at a table with some coffee. Their lunch and breakfast menu is nice, especially their eggs. Some items are misses, but with such a variety of things to try it's OK if one or two items don't work.\n\nThe service has been good as well. I hate waiting for a check or to order, but I've only had one bad day since we've been coming here."}
{"input": "Good food, horrible service!!! Very slow help and can't seem to remember what you said 4 seconds ago. I stood in line with three other people who were all amazed at how \"not smart\" the person taking out orders was.\nFood is good, but not sure that will help it stay around. Oh well.0~,"}
{"input": "Tried this place for the first time on a Saturday for a late lunch/early dinner. \n\nLOVE LOVE LOVE the low carb Naruto Roll, but it only comes with 5 pieces :( .... I would adding more healthy rolls wrapped in cucumber and soy paper like this to the menu. The Sashimi prices are a little high...\n\nAll in all we loved the mix of Japanese/ Korean food and the service, although the choice in music wasn't up to par."}
{"input": "This is a great beer distributor prices are very reasonable they don't overcharge you as the distributors in Philly I actually pay $10.00 less for a case of beer than what I've paid at the beer distributor in my neighborhood. I haven't gone anywhere else since they opened."}
{"input": "Super slow service, \"salads\" are not very good and really over priced. Won't be returning."}
{"input": "Service and coffee is not what it used to be. I went every morning on my way into work for the last year. Recently I've been driving further out of my way to ensure a better cup of coffee and that my order would actually be correct."}
{"input": "I am a critic of food period!  This place has the best Fried Chicken and Mac n Cheese in Philadelphia...  I am the best Southern Chef of ALL time and for me to say this is saying something...  I've eaten there 2X and the food gets better...  I'm going back to try there Brunch.  The owner and Ex Chef Alex sat with me unexpectedly and we cooked up great food conversation.  Great staff makes you feel like family...  YEA BABY!!!!!"}
{"input": "The pulled pork barbecue was excellent as were the sides (Cole slaw, bean and sweet potato fries).  The food arrived surprisingly quickly.  My water glass was never empty. \n\nThe caramel apple cobbler was excellent as well. \n\nBut the theme here was how excellent the service was to make the experience all the better. \n\nOf course the very best part was seeing my name plastered everywhere.  It made for a unique experience!!"}
{"input": "My wife and I have enjoyed dinner at this establishment many times. We mainly order the filet mignon and have never had an issue. We loved the ambiance so much that we decided to get married at the Tampa location. It was a perfect evening. The staff is friendly and the views are amazing. Also, the price was found to be very fair for the Tampa area!"}
{"input": "The appetizers were great I love the spring rolls and the dynamite shrimp and also the crab wontons but the sesame chicken was not good at all like it didn't taste like nothin I would eat again."}
{"input": "As a senior, I was looking for a bank for investments.  I wanted to diversify, and not have all my money with Edward Jones which is a great investment company.  When I entered the bank I was ignored.  The employees were chatting.  I had $500,000+ to invest.  I do not know why I was treated this way, but I chose to leave and go else where."}
{"input": "Beautiful desserts, and a beautiful atmosphere. I love the rushing of the tourists and the beautiful lighting in the bakery. \n \n The desserts are the kind that make children press their noses to the glass. I had my first cannoli here and loved it. You must try this place!"}
{"input": "I love Nooddi Thai! I got the drunken noodle last night. I told her I was vegetarian an she made the appropriate adjustments to my order. She then asked if eggs were okay. I was so pleased that she checked to see if I was vegan and make sure that she was accommodating my diet. I'm not vegan, but I thought it was very nice and extremely professional of her to ask. Way to go, Nooddi! Once again, food was awesome! I also ordered the curry samosas. Those were amazing! The pastry was light and a little crispy. The potato filling was so good. I don't think I will eat at any other Asian-food place in Media!"}
{"input": "Went to Amigos on our 40th anniversary citing the great reviews. Near to no atmosphere. Food was bleeeeah and the price was kinda high for what you get. Can't figure why people like their salsa so much as I think the stuff from \"NEW YORK CITY!!\" is as good and the chips are just the giant bag variety.\n\nGawd... all I want is some decent Mexican fare here in Boise!! Used to love Gloria's though not nearly as clean as one would like.  $47.00 with drinks and tip though I think one would do much better at one of the taco trucks as far as flavor goes."}
{"input": "Great location at the end of the wharf. Get a table outside (on the side where you can drink alcohol). Be prepared to wait for a long time for these spots. Interesting to watch them prepare and cook the crabs. Shared an assortment of food. Calamari and rock crab were delicious. Lobster bisque was not very flavorful (too creamy, not enough lobster) and bread bowl was very dry."}
{"input": "I think their pizza is great.  But here is my problem: FALSE advertising, especially when it comes to their \"specials\". \n\nI went there on a Sunday, and their \"special\" is: Sunday Upgrade the size of your pizza to the next size larger for just 1.99. Obviously you would think that if you ordered a medium pizza for 16.00, getting a large would be 18.00, right? Nope.\n\nWe ordered two medium speciality pizzas and get our bill: Two large pizzas at $22.45 and $20.15, minus $1.42 for each pizza....How exactly am I upgrading for 2.00 and saving any money? Basically they charged you for the price of the large and subtracted $1.42 (why, I still don't know). When I brought it to the attention of the cashier, she said that's just how it is/do it in the system. \n\nI decided to email them, and let them know the above--that was two weeks ago and no response from the restaurant at all. Pretty shady stuff Chuck. Don't think I will be going there again anytime soon."}
{"input": "The staff at VIP and Concierge Services is A+.  They took care of all our needs immediately and with grace and charm.  Big thanks to Kevin Brantner for arranging a wonderful weekend for us."}
{"input": "The bartender was lovely and very kind. I ordered an apple cider sangria, which was delicious and not too sweet. However, my 3 stars is sadly due to our server leaving with my food to box it up, and not returning with it. Now I fear I may waste away to nothing. Just a small whisp of a woman. He returned several times. Just never with my food. To leave the check...to take the check..all the while toying with my emotions.\nAlso I really feel like there should be 3 \"$\". This is \"treat yo self\" meal. Or I'm just poor-er than most."}
{"input": "It was our first time here but it sure won't be our last ! Best pizza we have had in years. Kudos to the chef and the very friendly staff."}
{"input": "I went here a few weeks back. I'm new to the area and LOVE karaoke! It was during that terrible tropical storm time. I was surprised that anyone was there at all. The few people who did come out, were good singers and the small crowd was supportive. I didn't stay long, but I'm thinking about coming back again. \nThe main issue I had was with the two drinks I ordered: a Washington apple and a whiskey sour. Those were the most watered down drinks I've ever had in my life! I was shocked and really didn't know what to say/do. I've never had such crappy drinks lacking in the alcohol department. What do you actually do in a situation like that? \nI'm probably going to go again (mainly for the karaoke), but I'll most likely just order something in a bottle. Those drinks deserve zero stars!"}
{"input": "I ordered a refrigerator from Menard's on 06/15 and received an estimated delivery date of 07/15.  I accepted this long lead time because I wanted that particular refrigerator.  \n\nOn 07/25, I called the store and was informed the order was still pending at the vendor, and they would call me back with a status in 20 minutes.\n\nIt is now more than one hour later, and I have not received a phone call.  Over the years, I have purchased appliances at Sears, Lowes, and Home Depot, and have not ever experienced something like this.  \n\nAt this point, I want a full refund, so I can purchase a refrigerator somewhere else."}

{"input": "I saw Dr. Saliman for an issue with cavities and was extremely impressed.  As a child going to the dentist was a literal nightmare, sadly my family dentist  didn't know how to use Novicane very well and it was almost literally torture getting even basic procedures done.  My experience here was the exact opposite.  Virtually painless and I was in and out in no time.  Will not hesitate to come back in the future."}

{"input": "I stayed in a hotel with free breakfast but this place is worth it. The grits are nice and hot and the servers are friendly. The fresh squeezed juices are an excellent compliment to the food. My daughter got the veggie omelette and was also very pleased."}
{"input": "The SPA is my greatest new find (plan on spending an entire day here), they have many areas just to lounge, incredible services, great snacks to keep you nourished..  We stayed in the Tuscany Tower on a non-smoking floor and the room was fabulous."}

{"input": "Ate brunch at Kanella today, the first time we have been there.  It really was a relaxing fun experience.  The service from Bill was great, just enough with out being patronizing.  We put him on the spot and basically made him order, everything was great, the rabbit soup with Fava beans was fantastic----wish I could get the recipe out of the vault.  We will return again, with a hearty appetite for really good food."}
{"input": "Sabrinas in collingswood is def greatly welcomed. Oh and if you didn't know, on a crazy busy weekend you can put your name in the wait list via yelp. It saved me atleast 30 min today when the usual wait time was close to an hour. Food is awesome like expected. Ive been to this one multiple times now. The stuffed French toast challah bread are amazing and are genermous. Huevos rancheros are amazing and I think the best ones in Philly area, the minty sauce on the top is just the best thing ever. Tofu scramble is also very good. In short pretty much everything is very decent. The servers are super friendly here. In summers they also have a back patio area which I've never seen open. In short , if I'm not planning to cross the bridge, pay toll, find parking or wanna deal with Philly traffic or get on patco to get to Philly then Sabrinas is my go to place for brunch and has never disappointed me."}
{"input": "Front end service was 5 stars and the space is elegant with an up scale feel. Wait staff was attentive and is well trained.\n\nBack end was 2 stars, because entrees took very long and were unimpressive. Flavor was good but short on some ingredients. The veal special was just a breaded fried veal cutlet; no cheese, no sauce. Pappardelle with pork had almost no pork; tasted fine though. Chocolate hazelnut tort dessert took very long to expedite and preparation was inconsistent. We ordered 3 - there were 5 of us at the table - and one came with chocolate shavings, while 2 did not. One was also stuck to the plate and the crust was like stone.\n\nThey did comp us on the dessert, which was very nice considering the wait. \n\nIt's a nice place and they obviously put a lot of thought and money into the space, cuisine and concept. I hope they can work out the defects and execute on their vision."}
{"input": "Tasty brunch, extremely friendly staff, great cocktails, and cute and comfy design. I love having a lesbian bar in the neighborhood. I will be returning with my mom for Mothers' Day. I'm so happy this place exists."}
{"input": "I have now been here 2 times, and both have been strictly out of necessity. The prices accurately reflect the overstaffed, up to date facility, while their service does not. \n\nWhile every time that you have to take your car in anywhere, you cringe at what they are going to come and tell you, this place has been far and away the worst I've experienced. I do not trust them in the slightest. If you're looking for tires, they may be ok, but the mechanic services are horrendous."}
{"input": "Mike's is the place to go if you're downtown and looking to satisfy your ice cream craving. Decided to go here after the place we were originally going to had a long wait, and it was a great choice. It was my third time here, and as always I will definitely go back in the future! My parents got the butterscotch shake, sister got the mint chocolate chip, and I got the coffee fudge. Would definitely recommend all of the flavors."}
{"input": "Absolutely delicious. Fresh and flavorful ingredients. Quality atmosphere. Reasonable service. Fantastic selection. Great for lunch or a light dinner."}

{"input": "I kind of don't understand the place to be honest. It's like a mix of a place where you can drink beer all night, have breakfast in or drink hot tea in the afternoon. Whatever it is, it's got pretty great stuff!!! They have some beer flavors off the tap that I've never heard of before like \"Strawberry Shortcake Lager\" (which was what I tried). It was good, smelled like strawberries but tasted nothing like them. I also had a taste of their pear cider (which you can also get off tap) and the flavor mixed with the fizz was actually really good. Not the kind where it sort of hurts your throat. And with the ciders you won't feel the alcohol so much too so you wouldn't really know if you're starting to get tipsy or not. We had some food along with the beers too, we tried their pretzels with beer cheese dip. The pretzels were freshly made and the dip was exquisite!!!!! Really good salty side to pair for a great night with beers and conversations!"}
{"input": "Great food and great service! We came in the late afternoon and we had no problem. We'll definitely come back!"}
{"input": "Outrageous birthday cake! We chose the Devils Food Cake - with vanilla buttercream icing. It was delicious beyond words! 12 adults who typically shy away from high calorie sweets - ate every last bite! The staff were super friendly & accommodating (we probably could have ordered a bit more advanced) - can't say enough positives about our experience. So glad to know I also have a location closer to me in Old City. Wish I could have another piece of that cake!!"}
{"input": "I am from California and was looking for something besides the hotel dining room to have dinner at.  I usually use the Yellow Pages to find restaurants and judge them by the size of their ads.  Spiro's jumped out at me, not because of the size of their advertisement (small) but Greek food just sounded good to me tonight.  I wasn't disappointed at all.  The Greek lemon soup was excellent and I liked the Moussaka, although the waiter suggested the Sea Bass.  All in all, the dinner was terrific and if I am back in this area, I will head to Spiro's again.  Thanks Neil for the wonderful service!"}
{"input": "Went here yesterday (Saturday) and I can officially say I am HOOKED. The chick'n ranch sandwich is incredible. It tasted so much better than real chicken - I couldn't believe how they nailed down such a real taste. Can't wait to return and try basically everything else they have to offer!"}
{"input": "We came for a Sunday brunch, and the place is amazing. We wanted to get a tour of the distillery, usually if the Brewster is there, they would totally do it, but because it was his day off, and the restaurant was busy, we didn't get a chance to do the tour. However, the manager was extremely kind, he offered to tour us when rush hour is over, we just couldn't really wait around. You can peak at the distiller through the bar though!\n\nReally like their drinkware!\n\nI had the bone marrow plate, and it was very good. Came with crispy toast. Other snack that looked interesting including the duck plate.\n\nThe brunch menu wasn't too interesting, but overall the food quality is good.\n\nNice beer and cocktail menu!"}
{"input": "The sub was great, but the attitude of the cashier was not very pleasant. She had a very rude tone the whole time, as if someone ordering a sandwich was ruining her day. That's what makes me not want to come back."}
{"input": "Super nice staff; great service. Always on time and on the ball to put you at ease. Oh, and they never leave me feeling guilty or scolded when I admit I don't floss every day - just a quick word of encouragement."}
{"input": "I don't remember what the food tastes like because I was distracted by the servers. But seriously ,great food, especially the chicken parmesan sub and the chicken and waffles . Nice drink selection, better than the usual bar fare. They make a great Zombie, and a very tasty Pimm's cup. Nice sized portions, clean restrooms and very comfortable seating."}
{"input": "Was not a fan of their cheesesteak. Their wiz sauce was mustard based and it was not terrible as a sandwich itself but mustard is not the flavor one expects or wants in a cheesesteak. It was overwhelming and not good."}
{"input": "Cutest little local gift shop in the city! Great jewelry, unique house trinkets, funny gag gifts, quirky cards... you name it, this place has it, and it's all freakin adorable. I especially love the Indiana \"317\" items. I brunch next door at Hoaglin's quite frequently, and I love wandering over to Silver in the City while I wait for a table. I usually end up with a fun present for myself. Also a great place to find housewarming gifts or stocking stuffers.\n\nMy only reservation here is that some of the items in this store are ridic expensive. I don't mind paying somewhat of a premium for handmade, local goods. No biggie. But $40 for a hipster baby onesie? $25 for an ironic keychain? Not everything is absurdly overpriced, but I'm definitely careful what I buy here. If I can buy it online for literally half the price, it's game over."}
{"input": "Of course we know it is not Las Vegas, but per Tripadvisor figured it would be worth going. To sum it all up, it's a castle of secondhand smoke!  We are non smokers and have gone out to clubs which had smoking and could tolerate it more than this place!\n\n We were very disappointed that we could not enjoy ourselves for all the smoke. Soon as some hit the door, they were lighting up cigs. SMH.. Why not invest in some of  those high power fans to vacuum some of this smoke out??? We were not the only patrons cutting our visits short because of this. \n\nNice looking hotel and heard the buffet was delicious, yet sadly we will never know... Doubt we will  ever come back unless it changes to non-smoking or clear divisions of smoking and non-smoking areas. Oh well, can not win them all. Maybe if some happy competition moves in town, things would be interesting."}
{"input": "Easy 5 stars! Went with a few friends for lunch. All gave 5 stars. I had a plate of UNBELIEVABLY DELICIOUS pulled pork and slaw. Only cost $4.57!!! Lunch buffet is 7.49 a pound. If I lived in Tampa I would go every day."}

{"input": "Had been there once before for a simple tune up, and everything went fine. That was back right after they opened, so I figured a simple state inspection would be no problem. \n\nWrong!\n\nI dropped the car off on Saturday afternoon, and Miguel asked me if I wouldn't mind leaving it overnight in case they didn't finish before closing time on Saturday. I needed the car back the next morning, but Miguel assured me it would be done by the time they opened, at 10am. \n\nI called on Sunday at 10:30, and not only had the inspection not been done yet, \"they guy who does inspections didn't come in this morning.\" So I went and took the car back, no inspection competed. \n\nPoor communication, complete absence of service, and no attempt ton even do the work they promised to do. \n\nI won't ever try them again."}
{"input": "The crab balls was good but the food is over priced and they don't give you enough food.. I won't go back there ever..."}
{"input": "During that Final Four weekend, I was trying to go to Yolk but failed to find a parking spot. I stopped and did some Yelping and found Milktooth at Fountain Square. \n\nWhen I arrive, I ended up with 30 minutes waiting. I was pleased because this usually means good food. I love waiting for seats. \n\nI ended up sitting at the bar to see the awesome chef cooking for everyone in the restaurant. I ordered the Lamb Patty Melt, Drip Coffee and Donut Balls. \n\nDrip coffee was the best coffee I've had for months. Maybe I do need to find something else other than Starbucks. \n\nLamb Patty Melt was a little hard to grab so I ate them as a toast + the rest of the sandwich. It has the right amount of lamb flavor and the bread was awesome. So was the fried egg. \n\nWaiter was super friendly and he had two fried egg sewed at his shirt sleeves. Now I need to do some shopping to find sleeve patches that interesting."}
{"input": "Thankfully I had a much different, and better, experience than most other yelpers.  While I agree that the prices are steep, quality seafood isn't cheap, so I don't feel that it was out of line. \nSince I don't like working for my food, I skipped the crabs and went for the scallops. For $24 I got 7 nice sized scallops sautéed in lemon butter and a side of pasta.  The scallops were some of the best I've ever tasted. I am of the opinion that $24 was a steal for the quality I received here. \nIn addition to excellent food, my martini was well executed and deliciously potent. The service was exceedingly helpful and friendly. I'd definitely recommend a stop in for all those that have passed by before, and for those who may have been less impressed in the past."}
{"input": "Every thing tasted great! The pie crust is perfect. The mac n cheese was very different and mashed potatoes were very creamy. The chicken tenders looked very juicy and the lemon pie was huge. Only three bad things Janas chicken had a few feathers on it, nothing except entres are priced and rolls are 95 cents, the bill for 3 was $47."}
{"input": "Servers were attentive but pizza took over 30 minutes, and that seemed to be the average for any order. Volcano Buffalo Pizza was pretty tasty. Celery on a pizza, who knew?!?!"}

{"input": "The quintessential coffee and wine bar. \n\nThis venue is adorably decorated and spacious, and it has the perfect amount of noise/bustle and fabulous treats to choose from. \n\nI am a coffee shop snob, and this will absolutely be my go-to in the city."}
{"input": "Service was good and fast. They were short handed and the hostess made me aware of this fact when I sat down. Good was served quickly and hot. Tasty as always at CB."}
{"input": "This is an interesting place that has promise if....\n\nMenu was more creative, tap craft beers had more variety, interior wasn't so dark and barren. Kinda of a fancy fast food place with more table and chairs. Not impressed."}
{"input": "I stumble upon this place during a day trip to Reno.  This sporting good store is well stocked with guns, gun accessories, and fishing gear.  Too bad that I was short on time, otherwise I could have spent more time browsing around.  It was interesting to walk around and check out all their real stuft animals on display from around the world.  Their customer service is really great, and their staff is knowledgeable and friendly.   It is really great to know that Big Box stores like Cabelas and Sportsmart did not drive out all of the smaller guys.  I will go back there on my next trip to Reno."}
{"input": "Food is good, however if your attitude stinks I refuse to give you a good review. We've been here before while visiting PHilly we were in Delaware and decided to drive to Philly. Only to be greeted by someone who appeared to be having a bad start to the new year. Hope you have a great new year."}

{"input": "This place is yummily delicious.  I don't know the prices I just piled a bunch of Chinese food  in my container and paid 9 dollars.  It was definitely worth the 9 bucks.    They have other food there too, but it's not Chinese so I didn't eat it."}
{"input": "This is the best tea shop I've been to hands down! The tea and the atmosphere are great and I LOVE the people there. They are all extremely helpful and knowledgeable about their product. I always look forward to trying the new kinds of teas they get in. I'll definitely my go to spot!"}

I appreciated the water and tea provided in the waiting area, and my experience with my brow waxing and tinting was nearly painless and so much fun! Leslie talked to me pretty much the whole time, checking to make sure that I liked the shape and color and making this first time experience very enjoyable. I will definitely be recommending Pia to friends and will be returning myself!"}

I am very pleased with the reply after previously attempting to advise management at our checkout with no response. Stephen, the GM, was very apologetic and was truly generous in making sure that our experience was improved addressing all of the issue that I had mentioned. I am very happy with service and we would be willing to give the Aloft another shot in the future! :)"}
{"input": "Pretty tasty ! The moo moo milk or whatever it's called was really good too! Although the sketchy area might make you think twice, once you get in, you'll completely forget about it. Everyone is friendly and food is served precise and quick."}
{"input": "Absolutely THE BEST bike shop in Tucson for the serious cyclist. If you're looking for high-end anything I would be really surprised if Fair Wheel didn't have it in stock (or if they didn't have it in stock, they could get it for you relatively quickly). The staff are extremely helpful and attentive. And if you're active in the local scene you could easily waste an hour in the shop just talking about bikes and bike racing. A true gem in Tucson."}
{"input": "I went here for lunch on a saturday afternoon and had a rather forgettable experience. This place looks like it would be a lot of fun with an outdoor seating area for live reggae music and a well-designed interior that that reminds you of the tropics. \nThe prices are on the high side but the food itself is pretty good. The service is just god awful though. We waited 45 minutes from our initial order to get an order of bread  and a drink. It was another 20 minutes to get the actual entrees. The beef ribs and chicken jerk are authentic, reminded me of trips to Jamaica. The rice is so-so and the same for the cabbage and plantains and in my opinion, the coco bread isn't worth it. I would like to give this place a better rating because the point of going there was the jerk chicken but the service was terrible enough to make you regret going. \nThat all being said, I'm planning on going to the live reggae shows they have and ordering take-out when the urge for jerk chicken arises."}
{"input": "Great food and amazing service! Not only were the tapas creative they were very well priced! David was our server and he made the whole evening. He is a gem and really great at his job!"}
{"input": "Was here about a month ago. The food here is great but the waitress we had was terrible. She stood at the bar...saw every move we made and did nothing. We waited for our appetizer....waited for our main course.... waited for her to notice we were done. Then it was like she was doing the world a favor by waiting on us. I had been here several times. I left her no tip.\n\nThe stars for the food.... no stars for her."}

{"input": "Let's talk about first impressions. Made a reservation for 9:00PM, didn't get seated until almost 9:30. But at least we worked up an appetite, right?\n\nOrdered the Lobster Risotto w/ shrimp and lobster. There was about 3 pieces of lobster total in the dish, but the taste was well rounded and creamy. It was filling, adequately satisfying and nothing special.\n\nWhat saved this from being a 2-star review was the fact that I tried my friend's Straw and Hay, which was stellar. The toasted ravioli is also one-of-a-kind: not a cheese bomb like other places and extremely balanced in taste. They weren't stingy with the filling, either. I'd probably have to come back and try other dishes, but all in all, I was salty about the waiting time."}
{"input": "This is a really interesting restaurant. It's not our typical kind of place but we are so glad we went. They have burgers/sandwiches and sushi. I got a couple of sushi rolls that were divine. My husband got the hot fish sandwich and fries which he also enjoyed. They also have spiked shakes! So much yum. Plus the service was great. We will be back."}
{"input": "We took a group of boys for a birthday party dinner and had a great experience. The waiter was really patient and helpful and easily handled our energetic group. \nThe food was delicious - although since it was our first time at Brixx, we were a little sure posed by the small size of each pie. The taste made up for it, though. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"input": "Thanks yelp reviewers...you didn't let me down!  And neither did Todd and Roberta!  They just left my house and I am in awe of what an amazing job they did!  Carpet and couch looks great...spots where my dog a some accidents the other day are all gone! Everything just smells fresh...no chemicals to inhale and nothing has that \"wet\" smell.  And I can't believe how dry it all is so soon after!  Plus they are the\nNICEST people with tons of knowledge and tips on how to care for your home.  Worth every penny and not only recommending them but definitely will be using them in the future!!!"}
{"input": "Clear your schedule! Its gonna take a while.  I had an omelet, it was just ok."}

I must've ate it too fast because it made me super sleepy, I think I even fell down because when I woke up my bottom was super sore. I highly recommend this place and when you go in look for this beautiful blonde lady behind the counter, she was beyond nice and had the voice of an angel.

{"input": "Great food. Delicious burger and fries. Shake was good too. Fun environment. I thought the food came REALLY fast. Milkshake a little slower. If you bring kids make sure they aren't afraid of dim lights (they dim them around 7) and noise as the restaurant is very noisy."}
{"input": "David Bridal should include alterations with their dress price. I think they  running a business within a business. People pay $500 for a dress and then $500 for alterations. That's not right. Make the dress right to begging with..Sizes were not normal. I ordered size 2, when I had to reorder size 0 and still had alterations to do. And I thought I'm in a great shape.. It took me at least 3 months to get it done. Good I started shopping for my wedding dress half a year in advance... Look for a better place."}
{"input": "Beautiful decor, great atmosphere, amazing food! My husband and I were thinking how it's NY prices but better quality than most we have had at this price point. He had udon noodles and I had a few rolls (Spicy Salmon is a must!) Flavors were great- not too strong but tasteful! :) We enjoyed our experience!"}
{"input": "The food I ordered was decent but the wait time for my family's order was ridiculous! We waited almost 1 hour after placing the order for 2 orders of fish tacos, a child's fried fish and a burger. It was 2:00 in the afternoon."}
{"input": "This may actually be the worst falafel pita sandwich I have seen in my life. I have eaten a lot of falafel. To pay upwards of five dollars for this is absolute robbery, and they would never get away with it off campus. IV Deli Mart's falafel isn't even that great, but it shines in comparison to this. Do not go here."}
{"input": "Loved the atmosphere here. Everything in the shop was beautiful and well put together. The barista was really great and helped me find a drink that I would like, and she was right, I loved it. Definitely will be back next time I'm in the area."}
{"input": "A great place for a drink or a pizza. I really recommend the stuffed crust Chicago style, but any will do. They use a pepper sauce for a unique flavor. Somedays it's dead-on, somedays it isn't.   Beer prices went up recently, and sometimes it's just too smokey, but the 'Thorn does a great job of feeling like the perfect corner bar. I do hope to never see the place with the lights on."}
{"input": "I stayed here the night before my wedding with a few of my bridesmaids and the next two nights with my brand-new husband.  We stayed in the Santa Rosa cottage and it was amazing!  The room was spectacular, tons of room, the most comfortable bed EVER, and fantastic whirlpool bath and double shower.  The staff was wonderful, especially the front desk clerk (Karen? I think...cute blond woman, super helpful).  We had a complimentary basket of snacks in our room, which was wonderful when my girls and I were getting ready the day of the wedding.  The room was so beautiful and I loved the balcony...I know that our pictures will be terrific.\nI will always have so many good memories of this hotel and will definitely end up going back!"}
{"input": "Excelente la comida.  Las costillas (ribs) fueron deliciosas.  We will return.  The service was great too."}
{"input": "Ordered food at noon. Waited 55 minutes for two salads. Friend ordered House Salad, when it arrived it was spring mix, red onions, cucumbers. No cheese, bacon, tomatoes, pecans. When questioned, response was \"the chef changed it.\" Without asking the customer?? And to what....the only items we have prepped? Asked for the manager but was told she was in the kitchen.  Guess that sums it up. Obviously will never go back. \nOne day later UPDATE: A marketing team member reached out to apologize and offered complementary meal as his personal guests should we want to try again. Hope this is indicative of a team trying to right the ship. Stay tuned."}
{"input": "The manager Shawn Bracken and our waiter clearly care about their customers and the entire experience at PF Chang's. They went above and beyond on a busy night to make sure we were taken care of. Will definitely be coming back to this location. (Also recommended the Korean chicken which is not on the menu but is phenomenal)"}
{"input": "The kayaking tour at the Santa Cruz Island was great.  My husband and I had a wonderful time.  Jen, our tour guide, was helpful and informative.  We had a lot of fun exploring the caves.  We didn't expect much but this tour definitely exceeded our expectation."}
{"input": "I have been on the Tony Roma's birthday club for the last few years so this year, I decided to try this location.  They send a coupon for $15 and you have to use it from Sunday to Thursday of your birthday week.  This location definitely looks newer and cleaner than West Edmonton Mall.\n\nSince I usually only eat here once a year, I expected to see changes in the menu.  I noticed mostly how much the prices increased and now they offer more burger and sandwich options.  I ordered my usual choice which went up to $25, St. Louis ribs and 1/4 chicken with baked beans and and baked potato but the coleslaw is also good.  It was good, guess you can't really go wrong.  The sides were just enough, not too generous.\n\nThe waitress was friendly and efficient and wished me a happy birthday but they don't offer any dessert or anything for the birthday.  The restaurant was almost full by the time we left around 6:15 p.m. on a Tuesday so looks like this location is doing well."}
{"input": "Bailey's range yet another great product from Mr. Bailey. \n\nThe choice of burgers is great whether you want beef, bison, or chicken.  The beer selection is great loaded with alot of local craft beers. The homemade dipping sauce are all unique and awesome.\n\nThis restaurant is great for kids....I repeat great for kids...."}
{"input": "The donut selection today was not the best. After seeing all of their Instagram posts, I was looking for more a selection. They had 3 different ones that contained peanut butter and another 2 that had banana in it. I ended up getting the Neapolitan, which contained chocolate pudding inside and had strawberry powder on the outside. It was delicious, but not worth the $4 in my opinion."}
{"input": "I love this place! It's an adorable little coffee shop on third street in Old City. It's a small but fairly well designed space with plenty of seating and room for people. The seating area has all your typical coffee house style seats such has tables, bars, and reading chairs. They have all your typical coffee house fair as well; bagels and sandwiches. I have been here quite a few times and it's all pretty good. Very friendly staff as well."}
{"input": "This place is amazing. I love historic places that are well maintained and this is just beautiful. The staff is friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. Our room had a huge bed that was super comfy. Very impressed and will definitely visit again."}
{"input": "Great food. Great prices. Everything is homemade and very delicious. They are very friendly and smiling all the time. Ask them about the name of the place."}
{"input": "Just had chicken taco, steak taco, and chicken salad. Chicken was a little cold from sitting on the cool salad container. The chicken was fresh and juicy. The steak taco was delicious and had ample meat for the taco size. The salad had a zesty lime based salad dressing which was delicious. My regret is that I did not order enough food so my wife asked me to go out and get more tacos."}
{"input": "Omg!!! I've never had a cheesesteak so good  I'm not a big eater so I ordered the junior philly; which is about 6 inches long, way more than enough if you want a good philly without feeling overly stuffed. I highly recommend this place."}
{"input": "Should've taken people's advice here, horrible horrible customer service, purchased a vehicle here 5 weeks ago still waiting for my registration; as of now nobody seems to take responsibility for their actions have been getting the run around. My temporary tag has expired and they refuse to give me another one. To safe yourself from aggrevation and headache find a different dealer. Placed a picture of expired tags.\nWill update on outcome."}
{"input": "I went here off of a referral. It was great I was done in five hours. I had individuals done, medium size and they cost 150 the hair included. There were three women that are on your head at one time. I will go there again! There very nice as well."}
{"input": "Do not waste your time and money on this place. The \"food\" is what you might expect from a small town Chi-Chi's."}
{"input": "Still going here after over 3 months.  Very crowded after work.  The fees are reasonable though and it has a pool so I've been happy with it.  Most of the other people going here have been friendly.  There are two in Tucson, the one I go to is by the Park Mall at Wilmot & Broadway."}
{"input": "I want to thank Eric @paintlessautodents.com \nEric is a wizard! I purchased a preowned Cadillac XTS from Coleman Cadillac. There was a minor dent to the car that I requested be fixed before I would purchase the car. Coleman promised that they would have it fixed shortly after delivery. I met Eric from paintlessautodents today at Coleman Cadillac and the man did an awesome job on the car, I cannot tell that there was ever an imperfection in the area he fixed. I highly recommend his services and will not hesitate to use him again should the need arise. Eric does come from Philadelphia and will not come North of the Lawrenceville/Princeton area. I cannot discuss prices as the dealership picked up the cost.\nEric is the owner of the company and clearly takes pride in his work.\nBefore taking your car to an auto body shop I Recommend reaching out to Eric first as he may save you time, money and inconvenience."}
{"input": "This use to be a reliable place for sandwiches but the last two were not good at all.  Cheesesteak was light on the meat.  There are so many good rolls to pick from in the Philly area but this roll was one of the worst and stale.\n\nHopefully it was just an off night. I'll try again but not for awhile."}
{"input": "Pretty bummed I didn't try out the Catbird Seat, because this place was totes underwhelming. When you enter, there is a large, awkward entrance and you have to go upstairs to be seated. It was probably only half full, but since it was strange weather, we decided to sit indoors. I'll just say again, walking up towards the hostess as she watches you approach just feels....weird. \n\nOur server was nice, and we joked with him about the silly flower in a very knock-over-able vase. We got two drinks--julep and one of their other ones with gin, both of which were utterly average to bad. \n\nThe crowd was sort of stuffy. The bread was blah. The food was pretty forgettable. The tenderloin was good because it was a good cut of meat. The Amish chicken was pretty average, with a not so flavorful and slightly MSG-y twang jus. Their signature grits was underwhelming as well. \n\nAll in all, stuffy and so overpriced. Bummed out!"}
{"input": "Been here numerous times. The food is usually always good. Be aware that you will wait a whole for your food, and the waitresses are never the best, a lot of waiting. Their food is great and the atmosphere is great. However, after going there tonight and getting the smallest wings ever and burgers that were about the size of McDonald's burgers, I may not be going there for a while."}
{"input": "It was great. The your was interesting if you're in to tours. The beer was good. The atmosphere was the best part. A couple of Tvs for sports, board games, live music, and yours every hours. At times it seems like there's a lot going on but it flowed well. Great spot for a good time with friends or a date."}
{"input": "Yes! I love this place! Maple Street Patisserie is the bomb.com! I've never been disappointed. Best blueberry muffin I've ever had in my whole entire life. Delicious breakfast and lunch spot. They also do specialty cakes so swing by during Mardi Gras and grab a king cake. Also the owner, Ziggy, is the man. He's always running around working crazy hours to make all these scrumptious baked goods. Can't beat this place :)"}
{"input": "Not sure how this is classified as deep dish. The sauce tastes canned and lacks any of that fresh tomato taste. It has such a dark hue and strange flavor and the seasonings are just completely overdone. The crust is just bland. No amount of cheese can help this shame of a pizza attempt."}
{"input": "The Grog's an ok bar - the burgers are good and the beers are cold - but the bartenders are a crusty group - plus I really don't understand why a Sam Adams draft would be $7 - seems a bit steep - even for Bryn Mawr."}
{"input": "My favorite breakfast in town!! Hasher with eggs over medium! Service is spectacular."}
{"input": "I have been seeing chiropractors and receiving chiropractic care for years.  I recently started going to Reno Family Chiropractic.   Upon my first visit, I was greeted by a very friendly and professional staff.  I was introduced to Micky R. Doyle, who then proceeded to give me a full and detailed evaluation and adjustment.   In just the two months I have been going here, I can feel a difference in my every day life with my lower back pain staying at bay most of the time.  Overall a great place, flexible scheduling,  friendly, and professional."}
{"input": "Had dinner with three family members. Lovely evening on the deck.  Service was fine as always.  Unfortunately, the veal parm I ordered wasn't.  It was dry and tasteless. To be fair my table mates enjoyed their dinners.  Drinks were good as was our dessert a profiterole.   But I can't help the thought that something as straightforward and usual as veal parm should be great every time at a good restaurant specializing in Italian food."}
{"input": "Visited last night for dinner. The turkey burger and loaded fries are just as delicious at the Charlotte Ave location. Happy to have this new location in my Sylvan Park neighborhood!"}
{"input": "Good downtown breakfast stop. Great service, food wasn't exactly perfect, but I tend to be hard to please in these regards. I hear lunch is really good also."}
{"input": "Dinner was absolutely delicious. Everything is fresh and made in an open kitchen. Had the salmon and it was so tasty! Definitely worth the wait!"}
{"input": "i think that this was good. i like applebees always\ni love applebees \ni love the two for twenty\nlove to save miney"}
{"input": "This place has the best chicken wings and shrimp fried rice.  I order it at least 2-3 times per month.  The wings are big and they cook them according to your request.  I also love their shrimp and broccoli.  The shrimp are always plump and juicy and the broccoli is crisp, never overcooked and mushy.  Also, the delivery staff are always prompt and courteous.  I recommend anyone to try this place."}
{"input": "I LOVE this place and the people who run it. \n\nMy favorite is their lamb: the kabob and the shank. I've brought some of my friends here to try the food and they've enjoyed it as well. \n\n\n*Don't forget to sprinkle some sumac on your meat order. It's the reddish brown colored stuff in the over sized pepper shaker at the tables*"}
{"input": "We arrived at Happy Hour, 50 cent oysters and half price drinks, so we had both, the ordered the beet salad (divine), mussels, and flammenkuchen (an appetizer I used for my entree),  All were excellent.  I first had flammenkuchen (or tarte flambe) in Strasbourg at a street fair, this was far and above that experience, with caramelized onions resting atop the cheese and hunks of bacon strewn around.  So good!"}
{"input": "Best pizza in Philly!  Grilled chicken salad is awesome too.  Most importantly I wanted to note that they have the nicest delivery guys I've ever interacted with.  All whom I've met have been so friendly and polite.  Once I didn't have as much cash on hand as I wanted to give as a tip.  The guy's response was that he was grateful for any amount.  The next time I saw him I obviously gave him double.  Love this place!"}
{"input": "Walked in about 3pm. Five employees huddled around the bar.  Several looked at us no one spoke. Finally we walked out.  Called the manager and told him what happened. He says, \"well the bartender motioned to you all\".  Really?  No one spoke and it was like we intruded. Rude and unprofessional.  By the way, the \"manager\" could have cared less."}
{"input": "I absolutely hate coming here to pick up a package. It's difficult to locate and they have terrible service. They are not even set up for customer traffic at all! And I only came here because it's impossible to set up a convenient time for a package delivery at my home."}
{"input": "I've been by Precinct in years past, and clearly thought it was worth updating my experience.\nWe ordered take out so we could catch up on shows at home while noshing out.\n\nThe Line Up:\n18\" pepperoni pie\n4 giant garlic knots (they are more like mini loaves) with sauce\n\nAlthough pickup is a bit of a pain in the butt (where can you do a quick park & run in?), I anticpated this and brought my cutie to fly in & pick up while I drove through the roundabout to circle back to get him & the grub. Good plan.\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nSUPER GOOD. Nice amt of Pep, sauce, cheese...good crust. The garlic loaves were nice! he sauce that came with them (red) was plentiful (that usually never happens) and was delicious. I love sauce. SAUCE.\n\nYum. Num."}
{"input": "First, I love that they offer food delivery! Second, THAT is a gyro! I got one delivered with fries, and actually I didn't need the fries! The gyro was so big I had to save half.  Both the fries and the gyro were very tasty. The tzaziki was spot on and the meat tender. I'll be back!"}
{"input": "The food at Ghini's is just delicious. Everything for French breakfast imaginable, and more. I highly recommend the eggs provencale, not something you can get anywhere else. Two eggs basted with a sliced hot house tomato, thyme, garlic and herbs de provance. Get the baguette toast and add the great hashbrowns for a mere dollar.\nMy personal favorite are all the crepes, both sweet and savory. Especially recommend the spinach and swiss."}
{"input": "The best middle eastern restaurant in this area!! Food is great and consistent!! Makes my tummy happy!!!"}
{"input": "The saddest thing about my experience with Burger Up's food was that I ordered it through a delivery service that will not be named. \n\nI ordered a pretty basic cheese burger, but it was absolutely delicious. I will stop there because the MONEY IS IN THE TRUFFLE FRIES.\n\nListen, I don't really understand who came up with the idea of the truffle fry, but my goodness  Burger Up has perfected this delicious side to the very last grain of truffle. The shoe string style is amazing and to top it off, the perfect house-made honey mustard is the perfect dipping sauce for anyone and I hate mustard. \n\nSo, yes, get the fries and a side of a burger."}
{"input": "You don't accept cash?  I don't think you grasp the ramifications of such a corpo-fascist economic principle.  No room for arrogant commies in my diet thank you so very very little.  Can't wait to see this place nosedive\n\nFor anyone in the dark about this policy,  watch Mike Judge's film, Idiocracy. Pay close attention throughout the hospital scene.\n\n \"Unscannable!!!\""}
{"input": "This place makes all other sweet shops look like amateurs. I had a chance to try their salted caramel banana pudding and their hot apple cider. Let me tell you!  Once you try their stuff you won't want anything else other than their sweets!  They are that good!  Also, the folks that run and work at this shop are very friendly. They make you feel like you are at home. No pretentiousness here either. It's all about putting out a superior product and they succeed!"}
{"input": "Amazing food. They were super quick at getting it out to us. The place is comfy. I love it! My new favorite place"}
{"input": "I love this chain! It's clean, quick, & inexpensive. Their special wax is way better than the regular kind. Highly recommend it."}
{"input": "Dentex is great! I have been going for a few years now. I typically go for cleanings. The staff and the service are amazing."}
{"input": "LOVED everything about this place.  Friendly, quaint and AWESOME FOOD!  We're from Kansas City and hard to impress with BBQ.......but they were great!.  Pulled Pork, Baked Beans, Coleslaw, Turkey, DELICIOUS.  Generous portions.  They need to bottle and sell that sauce!"}
{"input": "Plaza deli is awesome.  Great portions, reasonably priced, friendly staff.  Cash only though, so plan ahead."}
{"input": "Two weekends in a row with poor car selection for emerald executive elite and the shuttle to and from the airport has been ridiculous for Friday night pickups and Sunday afternoon drop offs. The wait has surpassed 15 minutes for a shuttle. And both weekends there were 5:1 enterprise to Alamo/National shuttles."}
{"input": "Love this place. My partner and I go all the time. The food ( thanks, in part, to James in the kitchen) is consistent and so good. My partner is addicted to the Rueben. I change around a lot but the burgers are fantastic. We prefer sitting at the bar and always get great service, we especially like Claire. Beautiful job on the decor. Bathrooms are always clean. This place is a great addition to the neighborhood and an asset to our community."}
{"input": "Had the platter! Everything was AMAZING!!! Smoked chicken is hard to perfect, but this was probably the best I've ever had!! Both times I ordered it! Very tasty & not dried out!! Someone has perfected the recipe!!"}
{"input": "I attended the #welldoneTBO tweet-up at Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza last week and had a great time. The folks at Anthony's were amazing with the customer service. We got to try so many menu items, and all were amazing. The Philly Cheesesteak Pizza was my 10 year old's favorite. I loved the Cauliflower pizza...so buttery and garlicky and delicious (vegetarian). We also got to try the carmelized onion-smothered wings which were out of this world. Also tasted: meatballs, ribs, salad...all very good. We ordered off the menu a half and half pizza with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms. So good. If they had liquor on the menu I would have given them five stars (I'm just not a beer or wine person). Thanks for a great evening Anthony's! We'll be back."}
{"input": "The service was slow and there was no ach tray and wait almost an hour our drinks. The music was good but that was the only good thing"}
{"input": "This dog friendly shop is perfect for center city dwellers who don't have a car.  Last weekend I stopped in for some plant food.  I was assisted immediately and shown their wide variety of fertilizers - they had exactly what I needed for my acid loving plant.  The total cost?  About $5, no crazy markups here.  Too bad my plant died from these sub-freezing temps before I got a chance to feed it.\nWill no doubtably be back for other household needs. Well stocked, well staffed, and I left well served."}
{"input": "GRAPEFRUIT IPA. LEGIT. INCREDIBLE. \n\nGreat atmosphere... And the fact that it's pet friendly, score!!"}
{"input": "My favorite place to stay in the French Quarter. Beautiful and well appointed. Housing such gems as the Carousel Bar and Criollo Restaurant, conveniently located near Canal Street, and staffed by friendly and attentive people, this is a great place to stay for visitors to New Orleans."}
{"input": "Went here 3 times one weekend while in town for a baseball tournament! Great food and service every time. From breakfast meals to sandwiches, every one was pleased with their choices. It's a good option for groups and files"}
{"input": "The food is great, but I just waited 20 minutes for a carry out order.  I called in at 12:07, my credit card was swiped at 12:32 and I didn't leave until 12:53.  I needed to get back to my office and there sat my order.  Other servers kept checking it and no one brought it over.  So my food is now cold.  $30 for cold food, even great food, still sucks.  \n\nThis is the second time someone from my office has had to wait for an order we called in.  The last time this happened, the server hadn't even given the kitchen our order.  If carry out isn't a priority, don't offer it."}
{"input": "Ask for Ms. Toni and youll get an honest excellent opinion. David's Bridals in general are expensive and sometimes overpriced. But if you need to go for convenience their nationwide store connections are amazing if your bridal party is all over the world. That being said, Ms. Toni is AMAZING!!!!"}
{"input": "Its a local deli. Prices are high, but that is the normal deal for places like this. They don't always put prices on their stuff which is sometimes annoying. \nI go here often because it is close, all the employees are very friendly and they always pet my dog."}
{"input": "The hubs and I met here last night for drinks per the suggestion of our yelper peers.\n\nThe atmosphere was fantastic. The bartenders were nice, the hostesses took our coats immeadiately and it wasn't as pretentious as they'd like you to believe it is. I love the columns of gold links on either side of the bar. I commented to my husband that I wanted a bracelet that looked like the links.\n\nWe stayed for two drinks and left fairly drunk. Hubs had two old fashioneds which were out of this world (and Im not usually a brown liquor kind of girl) and I had the grapefruit vesper: Gin, Ruby Red Absolut and Lillet. It was amazing. The bartenders were very attentive and nice, doing the rounds to make sure that we didn't have an empty glass and chatting about how the drinks tasted, etc.\n\nI will probably go back here...but the prices were kind of high. $46 for four drinks...eek\n\nxo"}
{"input": "I can walk here and won't go back even if they were the only place open at 2am.  I got the basic general tso's and it didn't come close to passing the test.  Go to East Cuisine."}
{"input": "For a drive thru, this far exceeded my expectations.  I got the chipotle burger and my husband got the chicken sandwich.  The burger was thick and meaty.  The toppings were premium - more than I would expect for a chain like this.  Waffle fries got the spot too!  Hubby ate his entire order of sweet potato fries before I could try one!  Oh - the garlic aioli was amazing!"}
{"input": "My husband and I stayed for one night.  Upon arrival, the check in was easy and fast but the front desk associate could have been a little more professional in the way she looked and handled our reservation.  She did not offer any direction as to how to get to our room.  She was alright, but did not deliver the level of service I am accustomed to.  Within an hour, we went to the Hotels' lounge to have a drink and eat an appetizer.  The server was more than professional and pleasant.  He was prompt, courteous and efficient.  Excellent service.\nThe room was spacious and clean and very comfortable.  I noticed a face lift for the hotel but it still looks a little dated. \nThe complimentary breakfast was very nice.  A buffet with both hot and cold foods, plus a made to order egg station. Great. \n\nOverall I would recommend this hotel and I would stay there again."}
{"input": "I've been to both locations, here and Center City. The only difference I noticed between the two was the music at this location was obnoxiously loud, but the important thing was the food was consistent. Below is my review of the Center City location, really don't have anything different to say:\n\n\"Very hip vibe. You order either a salad or stir fry meal via a touch screen monitor (just like at wawa, for those familiar). I like to build my own, but they have several standard options to pick as well. \n\nMy only gripe is it was a bit light on meat. You can add more meat when ordering, but I would have liked a bit more with the regular order. Speaking of which, be careful when adding veggies on the build your own, after 3 you incur a $0.35 charge. Not a huge cost, but it can add up if you don't pay attention. \n\nAll the produce is local, which is great, but wouldn't necessarily bring me into or keep me away from a place. I just like that it is good, fresh, healthy food. Will definitely be back.\""}
{"input": "2 stars for the staff trying and being nice, they seem really new. Expresso was good. However came in for lunch at 1100 per website and door and they weren't serving it. Apparently kitchen too busy. \n\nEnding up with a breakfast burrito and it tasted like a frozen burrito with some salsa out of a can and some cheap ass cheese. Over salted. Nothing fresh on it or about it. Oh and it was $12 I think I would have been happier and McDonalds. \n\nOver all disappointing... Maybe we will give it a shot another time for lunch or dinner but doubt it will be around very long."}
{"input": "Great experience this morning at Sierra Car Care. Needed headlight and taillight replaced and Andrew was fast and the price was fair. I'm new to the area but I'll be returning here."}
{"input": "I absolutely love this place and think is easily the best burrito shop in town. Great salsas, relaxed atmosphere, excellent service and price,  Most importantly the burritos are delicious. The chicken and chorizo combo is  my personal favorite but the smoked brisket is great as well. The medium burrito is plenty unless you are training for an eating event.  Family owned, not a chain and it shows in the attention to flavor. Highest recommendation if you are interested in good, healthy food (unless you eat yourself into oblivion) at a reasonable price."}
{"input": "If you are from the South (as in Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, South Carolina) this Mexican Restaurant will taste a lot like the yummy, cheap and greasy Mexican Restaurants that you are used to back home.  If you are from Texas-- you won't like this place. You'll think the food is too bland for your liking.  \n\nI am from the South and love their steak tacos (with cilantro, cheese and pico), their margaritas are CHEAP and great and the service is pretty good.  \n\nMi Ranchito's always has a crowd.  This is the perfect date night restaurant-- two can dine and drink for around $20 bucks."}
{"input": "We decided to take an alternate route back from Cochon Butcher to our hotel and stumbled across this small confectioner.  I had a few spare microns of space in my stomach for something sweet, so we grabbed a filled lemon and a chocolate cupcake.  The filled lemon was the better of the two.  Both were fresh, delicious, and hit the spot.  I wish we'd sampled some of the truffles but just didn't have room."}
{"input": "We go here all the time to get awesome coffee & just chill (: lattes & chai tea are amazing & environment is super welcoming!!"}
{"input": "I should have read the reviews before going here. I pass \"Tony Luke's\" on the regular SAT mornings around 12:30. So I decided to Stop in for the first time ready to have a delicious war in my mouth from a nice philly cheese steak. NOT!!!!!!"}
{"input": "I've been a customer for 6 years with no issues. I moved and had service installed at my new address. Apparently this is the quality of work you can expect from their technicians. As of right now I'm still waiting for a return call to find out how they plan on rectifying the issue.  (Photo posted)"}
{"input": "805 Kabob is the perfect place to satisfy your Mediterranean fix! The portions are large, and the quality is even better. The chicken and rice never disappoints with the sides of hot sauce and garlic sauce that they make fresh, not to mention the fresh pita bread from the stone oven. Highly recommended, worth the extra walk or bike ride"}
{"input": "Just moved to Nashville and was dreading finding a new vet that I loved and had reasonable prices.. With that said, we LOVE Dr. K! She is so personable and was really great with my dog, he was so comfortable the whole time. She also is very honest about pricing and tries the least expensive treatment first and discusses all the options with you! Would 100% recommend Parker's Paws!"}
{"input": "Love it!! I go to this place whenever I am in town and have NEVER been disappointed. The food is organic, fresh and delicious. I love that they buy from local farmers and fishermen. They also grow a lot of their own veggies! You can't get much fresher than that. There's lots of variety so I haven't even come close to trying everything. My favorite breakfast item is Carly's breakfast. Avocado on sourdough toast with a fried egg and sweet potatoes. Sooo good! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"input": "Wow! My sister had such high regard for this business and the food, I came all the way from California to have some. I WILL BE BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN!  Try the Indian taco and tacos dorado! The staff is soooooo friendly and make you feel welcome. Thanks ladies!"}
{"input": "Server was not good, I had high expectations of the food, but was let down. I ordered the Shrimp & Grits and my partner ordered the traditional eggs, bacon, sausage and pancake breakfast. My food arrived to the table cold and my shrimp where seasoned, however the sauce was a big disappointment. I would have sent it back however I was informed they ran out of grits (Essence Fest weekend)"}
{"input": "I don't know why I keep giving this place a shot. Service is fine. Food is fair at best. I should look at this every time I think of coming back so I am reminded I don't like it."}
{"input": "Oh they are such a pleasant surprise after the nasty people at Sparkle across the street. My husband had used sparkle for some thirty years, and I since I moved to Tucson,  but they finally chased us away with their poor service, ruined clothes and nasty attitudes.  Schaffer, on the other hand, has been terrific. They do an excellent job AND are really nice. I wish we had made the change years ago!!!!"}
{"input": "1st time here, my three friends and I ordered 4 bowls of ranmen and 4 cans of melon cream soda . I will say my curry katsu ramen was the best I've ever had and i just had Nom Noms ramen the day before. The staff was awesome and attentive.  I even booked my bday party here for next month. 100%/100%\n\nIn addition, the Kustu was crispy and the broth for my curry ramen was light and not over powerd by salts. The eggs were perfect again I just had nom noms the day before , and my 3 eggs from nom noms were cold.\n\nSo out of  our table group of four, 3 guest gives Naoki 10/10  and 1 guest gives it 6/10. \n\nMy background is in Asian culinary arts and hospitality."}
{"input": "I'm only giving four stars because in comparison to other locations, this one has some damn friendly and fast staff.\n\nThe food is on par with what you would expect. The only gripe I have is that I asked for extra pickles and they only gave me one extra one. Wah :("}
{"input": "AMAZING folks here and selection! Great customer service and help from 1,000 miles away, Ruby was great! I was missing a very important family birthday in New Orleans and needed a bottle of Champagne sent to the room. The hotel didn't offer that and after lot of searching i stumbled upon Vieux Carre and they were able to delivery the bottle of champagne I wanted (at a great price!) and actual champagne flutes for me!  I will def use them again"}
{"input": "Ordered from here last night. The pizza was really good, the delivery time was fast and the driver was nice. I will be ordering in the future. Their cheese makes their pizza."}
{"input": "After searching forever we land here, wait for a table of 8 was only 30 min... Really good for last min and no reservation. Our Server Kendra handled the table cool and calm. Her energy gave a home feel to the restaurant. We had a few appetizers, my personal favorite was the onion rings and the oysters. I did not like the gumbo, would not recommend that. For my entrée I had the Mahi Mahi it was a bit plain but overall the dish was good. And last but not least my dessert... Best is almost last, I had the milk chocolate cheesecake with a coffee, omg it was soooo yummy. I give Grand Isle a 5star for service, food, and atmosphere. :)"}
{"input": "I've been there twice, but won't be back. I had quotes/prices from other shops that had flagged items for future repair; that I ended up getting done at Burns, so I know Burns charges 40-50% more than other shops. They get two stars because they are friendly. The location is convenient for me - I can walk home after dropping off my car. But convenience isn't worth that kind of markup."}
{"input": "I ate like a Queen!  A breakfeast Queen- and I was treated like one too...Eggs were so fresh and home fries too, they must have a farm behind the kitchen.  Great Coffeeee"}
{"input": "Great pizza!  The owner Pete is usually there and he's a great guy.  They have lots of fantastic pizzas, but my favorites are the California (white pizza with pieces of breaded chicken cutlet, bacon, and tomatos, and ranch dressing instead of red sauce), Meatlovers (5 meats, but the sausage is the kind that does not have fennel in it, so more points for that), Veggie pizza (they saute the veggies first before they go on the pizza, and instead of using green peppers, they use sweet peppers).  \n\nUnfortunately, the shop was damaged by a fire in the next door laundry mat and they've been closed for a few weeks, but I can't wait for their doors to open again soon. I miss the lunch special, 2 slices and a self serve soda for $3.99.   Best local pizza you'll find in the Hatboro area."}
{"input": "We decide to make it a \"once a year trip at least\" from the Orlando area.\nThis place will scare for the amount of people that will pass through. Don't let it. It's well organized.\nJust decided what you want pick a number and they will serve you within 5 mins top.\nWe bought 5/6 cheeses  a couple of dry meats and a bottle of Cannonau wine.\nEnjoyed it in the patio and left after closing the brunch with an amaretto ball and a sfogliatella.\nBuy sfogliatelle before they are gone. They run out in less than 1/2 hours.\nSo worth it!"}
{"input": "Staff is friendly. Walters trio enchiladas where terrible and the rice was uncooked, gross.\nMy friends liked the mahi mahi and juicy Lucy burger."}
{"input": "Super cool spot, a bit pricey for portions but fresh and delicious with sweet and savory gluten free options! Also veg and vegan stuff too! Love me my Benna joints."}
{"input": "Lovely wine selection and complementary food...some hit and an occasional miss. Good service depending on who you get. I could become a regular here if the music wasn't so darn loud that you couldn't bring anyone you really want to talk to or if you just wanted to from, eat and read. Not a place for any of that!"}
{"input": "We ate here while staying at the Hilton Garden Inn. I would agree with the prior posts, this was some of the best food I have ever eaten in a hotel. I would certainly recommend if you are staying in the area. Otherwise, there are better options out there."}
{"input": "Had the sweet potato pancakes, waited in line outside for an hour but it was so worth it. The atmosphere was great and the service was top notch!!! Always recommend the pancake pantry!!!"}
{"input": "Atmosphere is adorable (5 stars!) and location is outstanding (5 stars!) but since food is likely why you would venture to a restaurant, they get an overall rating of 3.  Got a smoked turkey club and it was mostly good (loved that it came with 2 sides)... the meat just wasn't awesome. The creamed spinach was good, but the mac n cheese was kind of dry and bland (disappointing since it was an upcharge).\nNot giving up on this place yet, I'm determined to go back and try something else because I want to love it."}
{"input": "Increasing my original rating from 3 to 4 stars.  We have been back a few times, and there has been an increase in quality each time.  The rice wasn't crunchy the last few times and it seems much fresher.  I've tried both the green and red enchiladas, in addition to a fajita quesadilla, and all were very good!  Keep up with the improvements Dos Amigos!"}
{"input": "I went to Fez with my family and we were pretty excited to eat some good Moroccon food! However, it was a horrible experience.\n1) food was below average.\n2) overpriced for very small portions\n3) slow service\n4) I was surprised for the price they didn't even serve  free pita/ appetizer or Moroccan tea/coffee \n\n\n The only good thing was the ambience and that's it! \nWouldn't recommend it and wouldn't go back!"}
{"input": "A few years ago my parents, my brothers and i went to this restaraunt for my birthday. We ordered the usual huge spread because we love thai food. But there was a surprise in the tea. A roach, swimming around. The server brought a new pot (no apology) and that was all. No taking the tea off the bill, no acknowledgement of what happened, nothing. We haven't eaten there since."}

{"input": "This truck came to my place of work and I am so glad. The mustard bbq sauce is great and goes great with the sausage which was cooked with a great \"crust\" and flavor. The owner is very personable and makes all of his own sauces which are all delicious. \nThanks and keep it up!"}
{"input": "The little add-on to Delicia.  I would imagine most people come here for a drink while waiting on their table for Delicia.  They have very similar food, and nearly identical drinks (besides the signature ones like Fire N Ice) \n\nWe ate here once before and the food was good.  Bartender is not overwhelmed and therefore very friendly and talkative.  Drinks are made well and cost about %25 less than next door at the restaurant. :)\n\nWould I come here purely for La Mulita? nope....but I'd come here while waiting for my table at Delicia for sure. :)"}
{"input": "Handlebar is my favorite bar in St. Louis. That is pretty much all I have to say. I just felt like doing an update and 5-starring that shit because we went the other day for happy hour and it was great because OF COURSE it was. Love it."}
{"input": "To die for. Fabulous service and even better food. Totally delicious."}
{"input": "We stopped here off a recommendation. The breakfast was really incredible and the juice was so fresh. I would definitely give this place a shot if you're in the area!"}
{"input": "We went here on a Saturday night for dinner and drinks.  Service was quick and friendly... and they were able to sit us all together.  The football games were on... drinks were well-priced and always filled.  I highly recommend Smith's!"}
{"input": "This is the best bar in the Olde City neighborhood. I have been eating and drinking here for years and I have had much of the food on their menu. Personally, I favor the pulled pork but any of their barbecue items will really make your mouth happy. \n\nSharing a pick-3 with a date over some delicious (and often rare) craft brews can make a great night out. I also find its a great place for happy our with friends becuase many bars Happy Hour specials only include cheaper beers. At Khyber the Happy Hour special applies to everything.  The bacon popcorn is also a clutch choice to accompany happy hour beers."}
{"input": "This was my first time, but my dining companion has been before and pointed out a few changes. I had the portobello stuffed pretzel and he had the black bean burger. Both were fine. Our complaint was with the sides. The options were Ruffles or store bought pasta salad. My companion said they used to have sweet potato fries so he was really disappointed since that's why we came. I think we'll stick to stopping in for a drink and skip eating there."}
{"input": "Called service 5:15 pm Wed and they had appt window narrowed to between 9 and 10 am the next day.  Andy Y  arrived punctually, made diagnosis inside of 10 minutes and provided reasonable options for blocked drain pan n valve leading to recurring locked freezer drawer on 7 yo Samsung reefer.  Got the drawer to open, removed ice, stripped unit down front n back, cleaned dual freezer compartment drain tubes showing both to me, filled with very gnarly, moldy scummy stuff.  I paid the $89 minimum diagnostic fee plus another $54 or so as Andy's work came to $143 which the minimum fee was credited toward.  I could have googled more self repair vids, spent thrice the time making a mess and twice the $$$ for Andy or others to fix my inevitable misadventure.  So naturally I was very happy to get my freezer back in less than 24 hours for $143.  Your mileage may vary!"}
{"input": "Now Hannah is there and my oxygen facial was amazingballs. She asked all kind of questions and had real solutions.  The experience was amazing and she was a pro and the room is upstairs and quiet and super cute. Finally a spa!!! I want to go back for micro and she also does body waxing!!!!! After my eyebrows she used something called a cool hammer to take the redness off my skin and I didn't look like I had a red Mustache for a day!!! I am super impressed and can't wait to go back."}
{"input": "Sat in open seating at the bar, purposefully picking a table near the large open window at the front of the restaurant. I came with my mother and we were looking for drinks and a quick bite to eat. We ended up going with the margarita flight and a quesadilla. The margaritas were amazing and the quesadilla was delicious. We ended up getting a second flight of margaritas because we couldn't settle on just one from the selection. Our waitress was sweet and attentive. She had a lot of recommendations both for drinks at Margaritaville and other places on the strip. Live music arrived about 20 minutes after we had and had a good sound and playful interactions with those in the bar. Our bill was approximately $50, which initially was shocking but I left happy, full, and feeling good from my drinks so it was worth it. Overall a nice experience; good drinks, food, and environment."}

{"input": "I had to write an order after coming here a couple of times because this place is just terrible. I tried their hoagies and they are so greasy i got nauseous after eating them... Then yesterday i accidently ordered from here instead of angelinos and i got the buffalo chicken sandwhich and it was just covered in blu cheese and greasy sauce it was so Disgusting.  All their food is terribly greasy and over seasoned its too much.. Back off on it a little and use freasher ingredients it will be much better!\n\nIll also add that their desserts suck, taste bland and a waste of money. Their sodas are usually expired and flat. I hate everything about this place!"}
{"input": "Here for convention and Imo's was suggested as \"The Best\" St. Louis Style pizza by hotel staff. \n\nI opted for delivery which was good and efficient. The food arrived still hot. I ordered a medium pepperoni and an order of toasted ravioli. \n\nNow, I knew the cheese on the pizza was provel so it would taste different. I was really not impressed. It may just be a matter of taste preference. It was hard to separate each piece of pizza too.  Like, it wasn't cut all the way through. Not really a fan. So thumbs down on the pizza. \n\nWhat bumps the stars up are the T-Ravs!  I was hoping for cheese ravioli but the staple is a meat mixture. Boy...do they do it justice. They were the bomb!  The sauce with it was too watery but still tasty. I would order just the ravioli next time!"}
{"input": "I have enjoyed everything I have bought here. Everyone raves about everything I bring to family gatherings and other celebrations."}
{"input": "We stayed at the Opal across the street and thought to give this a try.  I had the coconut shrimp as an appetizer - they were very good.  Wife had a chicken sandwich which she liked.  I ordered shrimp tacos which were TO DIE for.  We ended up getting desert - key lime pie and chocolate strawberry cheesecake.  My wife loved hers.  I enjoyed lunch here so much we came back for dinner and got the same thing, couldn't recommend it more. Everyone else got shrimp which everyone loved.  Good prices, highly recommend this place.  It's new too which is nice."}
{"input": "This place has phenomenal food from start to finish. The brussel sprouts were so savory, we ordered two helpings. We also had two of the chicken tacos, and two of the braised short ribs. For dessert, I believe we had something chocolate, and definitely delicious. We actually went to this place back in April but as I'm sitting in another restaurant telling my friend about our experience at this place, I thought I should write them a review since it was so worthy!"}
{"input": "After a beautiful autumn walk through the Botanical Gardens I stopped in for lunch. It is basically a old service station turned restaurant, but don't let that throw you off. Trust me - you will love this place. \n\nThink vintage oil cans and crystal decanters with silver trays and copper tagines. Add to the mix a variety of artisanal gin, rye and Japanese whiskey served over an upbeat but chill background music (Like ARE & BE on Spotify).\n\nI ordered the Ugni blanc with some baba ganoush and the autumn root vegetable tagine. Homemade bread was amazing and everything was delicious. I'll let the photo do the talking.\n\nI'll be back!"}

{"input": "So the atmosphere was awesome for this second visit. The service was great again, had a male waiter this time and he was very good. Came and refilled out chips once, cleared plates in good time as we were done, and just overall really nice. Again, didn't feel rushed at all which was prefect because we were watching the phillies game so stayed awhile after our meal. One dissapointing part though.. the smore bread pudding i was so excited for, completely not what i was expecting. It was basically two less dense chocolate brownies with a graham cracker sitting on top and marshmallow ice cream. Of course it tasted good but I wouldn've thought it would be a bread pudding with a graham cracker crust or something, not just a graham cracker thrown on top. So that's my only negative part about this place. \n\nFried pickle chips, delicious! Make sure you let them cool, they taste so much better when they're not burning hot."}
{"input": "Great food, great service, and great price!!! My husband and I really enjoyed this place! It's pretty nice inside for being a casual place. We were thrilled with the price and the quality and portions of the food! Def will come back soon!"}
{"input": "Neighborhood bar, with lots of seating. They have patio seating in the summer. Can't complain about anything here; cold beer and quick service.. what more could you want?"}
{"input": "I had a great salad here.  Wipe visions of wimpy, unsatisfying fare from your mind.  It was a loaded bowl, with nothing but healthy toppings.\n\nReally no atmosphere to speak of.  Get in, eat, get out.\n\nUnfortunately, the dude that helped me was unpolite.  He rolled his eyes the whole time, then informed me the salad I was choosing was \"too much food\", and made fun of the fact I couldn't pronounce anything correctly.  Every time I picked a topping, he questioned me about it.  What a jerk!"}
{"input": "The owner of this location (and two others including Southampton) reached out to me after my previous review. We ended up talking for half an hour and I was very impressed with his approach to business... he's definitely the type of person I want to do business with. I returned to Saladworks on two separate occasions and the service had vastly improved. The new summer salads are wonderful!"}
{"input": "Very cool nostalgic-type bakery. You must try the pepperoni stromboli... NOW!"}
{"input": "Just moved into the area and wanted to take my Caribbean parents who were visiting out to lunch. Seeing the Trinidadian flag hanging out the door, I knew I had to take my mother there! The ambience was calm and relaxing and our server Jay was very kind. We started with the fried shrimp wantons which were great, and our three dishes: curry goat, curry shrimp and curry chicken roti were all flavorful. The roti was so soft! A mild taste for all backgrounds, but they were happy to bring out a side of pepper sauce for my dad who needed a kick. The owner Anthony was kind enough to greet us and explain the meaning behind the name of the restaurant. The peanut punch is a must have. The food was authentic and satisfied my Trinidadian mother! Will be frequent customers!!"}
{"input": "I've been to El Charro at least 5 times, although not in the past year.  El Charro always had great food, great presentation, and good service.  Their food was always great, tasty and the place looked very appealing, off course it was brand new when I started going there, this is the El Charro in Oro Valley.  I'll have to say the reason I stopped going wasn't the food, but the fact that the last two times we went, the restaurant was full of flies, we even changed tables, but the flies where pretty much everywhere.  I understand they have a beautiful outside sitting area, and people are in and out, but when you are serving food, you need to take care of that.  I also went to another place in NM, same issue, and the owner wasn't too concerned about this, big mistake.  People don't want flies flying into their plates when you sit down to eat.  I hope to go again, but if they haven't addressed this, I won't go back again.  With all that said, other than the two times we encountered this, the food is great."}
{"input": "The gelato may be very good, but I can't remember after such a negative dining experience.  With the exception of one person (the owner?) the staff were pretty missable.  Not a single smile to be had.  I don't expect my behind kissed, or even small talk, but I don't expect to give business to an establishment that hires people who seem bothered to be there.  There are three tables inside with ample room for a few more---not very family friendly.  Me, hubs and three children under 3 waited patiently for a table.  The icing on the cake was other customers---a lady practically climbed over my daughter to grab my hubs' seat when he got up to use the bathroom.  Seriously.  Not the establishment's fault, but all around poor attitude and rudeness abounded.  We won't be returning.  If you have children, pass on this place and enjoy ice cream at home."}
{"input": "Tour guide Preston was late then spent the next 15 mins on the phone, not organized. He spent most of the time stalling because the next restaurant wasn't ready. Food was OK, definitely had better at other local places. Not worth the money even at Groupon price. Highly disappointing!"}
{"input": "If you want to pay for everything a la carte this is the place for you.  \nFood wasn't terrible not impressive.\nThey brought a basket of chips and some tomato sauce which I asked politely for something spicier and some pico de gallo.  She brought them happily to me and the salsa was much better.  When asked what we would like to drink I asked for a coke and she brought out a bottle which I stated I wanted the fountain drink.  She said \"oh that's only Pepsi\".  Never mentioned that they only had bottle drinks for coke.  \nWe ordered our food which was reasonably priced, asked for sour cream and also to put cheese on the taco.  She let us know cheese was extra.  \nIt was $2.50 extra for another basket of chips.  \nWhen I received the bill we paid more for the condiments then the actual food.  Side of sour cream 2.00, pico de gallo 2.50, salsa 2.00, chips 2.50, cheese 1.00 and the bottled coke that we didn't want 5.00.  \nJust a suggestion...when you order anything make sure to ask if there is an extra charge."}
{"input": "Platoon is awesome and you definitely want Steve C as a trainer. When I started platoon, I was going once a week and attending a different group exercise class the other days of the week. After a few months, I was only coming to platoon 3-5 days a week. I loved how my workouts were customized to what I could do and wanted to do instead of a group workout that was impossible to complete. Steve is a great listener and motivator and sets realistic goals. The staff at platoon are very nice and accommodating. I never had a problem with billing or scheduling."}
{"input": "Had the chicken tikka masala and chicken curry potato, they were spectacular. With generous portions. The naan was so-so and didn't get very much."}

{"input": "Eat there about every two weeks and it is either a training store of some kind or they are the weak store in the area. The food is either super hot or just above cool?. The last time I went through the drive thu, I told the guy to large size the order with a large size diet coke. Got a charged for it. I received small fries and a small coke?. When I stated I paid for a LARGE he just re filled a large cup and DIDN'T give me the large fries...and wasn't apologetic about the mistake either?"}
{"input": "The outside of this Walmart appears to have been renovated, but it's still Walmart. The customer service is usually terrible (there are a few bright spots here and there), but the low prices keep people coming back and back. This location has self check-out, which does help lessen the wait times to check-out when people know how to use the machines properly. Overall, this isn't the worst Walmart in the area (better than the one in Spring Hill)."}
{"input": "Terrible experience!\nMy wife ordered a mild sausage sandwich because she needs to stay away from spicy food. \nThey substituted with jalapeño flavored anyway with out even asking, after she stated she did not want anything spicy. How irresponsible.\nWill never visit again. Visit at your own risk!!!!!'"}
{"input": "Food is superior. Mel's Chicken Cutlet sandwich is everything you want in a cutlet sandwich. Perfectly cooked chicken with the best roll. Try it. The only drawback is the noise. It's deafening at peak meal times. They have to hang some noise absorbing panels somewhere. A great place to eat when it's not crowded. And it gets crowded!!"}
{"input": "Fun place, inviting interior and a pleasure to hang outside with the couches, etc. brunch food was very good, and beer selection exceptional.  Waiter, however, was a disaster.  Was jerky to us from the beginning, (we were all sitting around asking each other why he was being such a jerk to us), did not know the menu at all, constantly disappeared on us, and was argumentative when he brought out the wrong order (twice)...and there were only 2 other tables at the time). Otherwise, would have gotten 4 stars."}
{"input": "Old school decor - dark woods and copper tile ceiling (real?)  I was there for the express lunch, a good deal.  You get a choice of soup with the entree of the day.  The gumbo and crab bisque were spot on. Gumbo - rich with the andouille sausage adding just a bit of heat. Crab bisque - flavored with old bay style seasoning but not overly salty and just a bit of shredded crab. The entree was a garganelli with roast pork ragu, mushrooms and creole tomatoes.  The sauce was light and blended the flavors well.  The roast pork highlighted the dish - fork tender, caramelized and left me wanting more."}
{"input": "Updating my review as our last two visits here have been much improved. Im not sure if they have new management but whatever they're doing makes this a viable fastfood stop for Bellevue. The service is friendly and fast and orders have been correct / fresh (for fast food!) \n\nManagement, keep up the good work as its noticed and appreciated."}
{"input": "CHICKEN & WAFFLES!!!  By far the best I've ever had. Flavorful and moist chicken. Fluffy waffles with the best country gravy I've ever had.  My husband had a grain bowl that was also very good. Nice selection of beer and wines. \n\nPut this on your list of dinner options."}

{"input": "Nice bar to relax, smoke a cigar and enjoy a drink. My bartender, Adrian, made me a fantastic dirty martini."}
{"input": "Cool touristy place right in the heart of it all.  I loved the fact that people were throwing beads in the restaurant through the windows and that floats were passing by as we ate.  However, the service we received was atrocious.  I'd cut the woman some slack if I saw a doctor's note certifying that she was really mute, but she wasn't sharing.  Her response to us ordering was sighing and rolling her eyes.  WTF?  The good thing was,  I was not here to make friends.  I came here with one purpose in life - to slay a mighty roast beef n gravy Po Boy.  It was just what I wanted and more.  So good.  Sweet potato fries are bomb, too.  Good selection of Abita.  Hush puppies were whatever.  Kinda tasteless and underwhelming.  Bread pudding was amazing.  Overall, the food was a 4+, but the service brought my rating down.  I felt like we got one of the only people on Bourbon St. NOT having a good time."}
{"input": "Delicious, big burgers and generous portions of french fries. Customer service was really friendly as well."}
{"input": "I came here for a Sunday lunch. Didn't expect much, since it always seems touristy. If you want reheated frozen food, this is your place. Decor is not good, food is not good. Boo. Bathroom was clean. That's earns it A star.\n\nPoor tourists! If they come to Philly and come here, they are getting a very poor representation of what Philly has to offer in dining. Very poor, indeed! Take a picture of the mural and keep walking. There are many, many better places on South St. and around the corners on 2nd, 3rd, and 4th streets."}
{"input": "We came on a Saturday morning after waiting a few months after opening hoping that they would resolve the issues from a new restaurant opening. We were seated right away and the server brought water, coffee and took our orders right away. We waited over 30 mins for breakfast. I got the freebird and came out first before my husband's dish. While it tastes good, it was just potatoes and the spicy sausage gravy was mostly a sauce. There was barely any sausage. My husband got the ny deli omelette that had way too much cheese that it overpowered everything and very little pastrami. Lastly, we were ready to go and our server spent at least 10 mins chatting at another table so I couldn't get our check. I'm not sure if we will return."}
{"input": "Very friendly owner, I love the way ms Lee did my nails. I now have a place to get my nails done now that I live in mid city!! Thank you lee nails!"}

{"input": "This place has been around forever! Food is pretty good, there's a good bit of variety on the menu as well, so I always try to get something different. If you are in the area, you should definitely stop by if you want tasty food and friendly service."}
{"input": "This is the best Thai food we have found in Tampa. Hands down. Really great PadThai. Yum. You have to check them out. Excellent food. Can't wait to go back."}
{"input": "Awesome sushi! We've been looking for the best sushi around the area for a long time and finally we found it! We were impressed with everything. One thing better than the other one. We got the Jalapeño popper, Suno Mono, Spicy Kani salad, Samurai roll, Masami roll and deep fried banana for dessert."}
{"input": "This was my first visit and will certainly not be my last. I had an eye exam with Dr. Chuong. She was incredibly friendly and very knowledgeable. One of the best eye exams I have had in a long time. The staff was very helpful in selecting a pair of glasses for me. They did not try to push me into buying a more expensive pair of glasses nor did they try and up sell me. I will definitely spread the word. Exceptional customer service. If you need an eye exam/new glasses, please take your business there!"}
{"input": "awesome place.  good food. nice people.  rotating specials.  all home made.  what else do you want?  Chicken salad is a great pickup to make sandwiches at home."}
{"input": "Good Chinatown Flavor in South Philly. I usually get the Wonton Noodle Soup here that is comparable to Chinatown Restaurants. Clean Friendly Atmosphere. If you don't want to deal with the traffic downtown I suggest stopping by here."}
{"input": "This was a cool place to stop by and check out the birds on a Sunday morning.  \n\nMy daughter and I have stopped in here a couple of times so she can look at the birds.  Very friendly staff.\n\nIf you're a bird person this is the place to go."}
{"input": "\"High Score!\"...unfortunately I wasn't playing a video game with my friends, but rather wracked up the highest weight for my frozen yogurt. Why did is \"win\" this completely made up competition? Because this place is THAT good. Seriously, everything tastes great and even the fat-free options still feel like I'm splurging on my constant being-a-girl diet. The location is great if you're out an about on South Street and need something sweet. :)"}
{"input": "Another Yelper hit it -- this is a noisy, crowded restaurant with big screen TVs.  I wouldn't call it a sports bar.  Nothing wrong with the place.  Cool location, good beer selection.  The food - delicious, but eliminates itself as a \"sports bar\". My sons and I wanted to catch some pub grub and the hockey game.  Got the game.  The grub-- eclectic.  Do go here if you want a busy, bustling, energetic, tasty, flavorful, thumping music-beat experience.  Don't go here if you want  a burger, a beer and a hockey game amidst sports conversation."}
{"input": "Went here for my birthday with a group of 11 people. We got a table quick! The design is super cute! We walked upstairs to check out the roof top seating, can't wait to sit up there for the summer! I had the yuca fries as an appetizer and pork pastor for my main dish. I recommend the Livery margarita, its really good and doesn't taste too sugary. My friend surprised me with churros and they were amazing! Love this place will definitely return. Our server was awesome too!"}
{"input": "Last night we tried to get into the oldest Italian Restaurant in South Philly. Thankfully, they couldn't fit us in, so our son said lets try Angelina's  so we walked around the corner and into a small Italian Restaurant.  Immediatly we felt at home.  Angelina is cooking in the front of the resaurant and her husband is servicing. There were 3 of us and we started off with Eggplant and roasted pepper appetizer.  One bite and we were hooked.  We ordered the Veal Osso Bocca, Carbonara and lasagna.  Everything was absolutly DELISH!!  Can't wait to go back!!!"}

{"input": "Cellini is a hidden gem in the SOG area. Located on the corner of Interbay and Bayshore, Cellini offers fresh flavors and authentic favorites. Their pizza is some of the best in South Tampa, especially the Country which consists of sundried tomatoes, goat cheese, and pesto sauce. Another favorite of mine is their Rigatoni Vodka, which is some of the best vodka sauce I have ever had. Cellini also has one of the best wine collections in the SOG area."}
{"input": "The atmosphere was great! We had amazing service by the server Killian and the food was so good! Excited to return soon!"}

{"input": "Maybe my mistake was going during daylight hours. This looks like a nightclub which really shouldn't be seen in the light of day. Furnishings which probably look posh at night just looked seedy and worn. And there was an odd smell. My beer was fine, but it wasn't anywhere I'd go to relax."}
{"input": "A wide selection of crafting materials but they're very pricey. Sure you can find most craft supplies here which range from custom albums to baking equipment and art supplies. Tip: If you're fogging to buy something, bring their monthly flyer for a 50% off one regular priced item. So many decorative pieces to add-on for those who are creative. This season Christmas decorations are out. I'm surprised get have fake flowers simulated to feel real. I know what to get all the girls now. Ahaha...just kidding. They also do group crafts where you practice to make cakes but I believe enrolment is required. Maybe see their website for more details on event and location. Staff is friendly. Parking lot is very spacious. Good for group activities, like cake decorating and etc. See website for more info. www.michaels.com/classes\nRecommended for anyone specifically looking for arts & craft supplies or just to browse around."}
{"input": "Original menu and great place to meet up. FYI the crawfish beignets are great but it's not an actual beignet stuffed with crawfish like you would image (Like La Petite Grocery does with crab meat) still good though."}
{"input": "After getting my car damaged in a minor hit and run, I was told that Calvin's does great work at an affordable price. I used to live very close to the shop and was happy I could give my old neighborhood's shop some business. I called ahead and set a time, Calvin was very nice and professional. When I got there, he helped me right away. He started doing the estimate and started asking questions. While talking, I told him I already had a claim in for the damage. He immediately changed his tone, refusing to finish the estimate. Insisting my insurance company would not accept his estimate. This was very confusing since I already had my insurance company's estimate and the cash was in my account. I tried to explain it to him but he wouldn't listen to what I was saying. This was just a bad experience."}
{"input": "The first time we went here, it was sometime around 7.  They were closed.  They don't close till 8:30.  So we came back a week later.  The burritos were cheap, but you get what you pay for.  They don't have a whole lot of flavor.  They're not really bad; it's just that there are way better options in Philly.  I don't know if there's much competition in UC for a casual take out burrito (it seems the good Mexican around here comes from lunch trucks), but if you have suggestions, pleast throw them my way."}
{"input": "If you're looking for something different in this area, I highly recommend GlobalQ.  Their quesadillas and wraps are all very good, I've had at least half of the items on the menu and they've ranged from, at worst, just ok, to phenomenal.  The quesadillas are very big and are full of some pretty unique combinations.  The wraps are also huge, I usually only eat half a wrap and save the other half for the next day.  While they're all pretty good, I recommend going outside the box and getting the 'Montreal' or 'New Orleans'.  And their 'French Dip' quesadilla is also very good, but for some reason is not listed on their menu.  Check that one out if you like french dip sammies.  \n\nBest part about this place: THEY DELIVER."}
{"input": "Good cuts.but watch out they don't keep to the posted gours.  It's frustrating to drive 20 minutes to find out they closed earlry.  Happens s lot. Call first"}
{"input": "Been here about 4 times so far and haven't had a bad meal yet. Awesome cocktails and friendly service. Being so new, they could use a bit more ambiance such as art on the walls but I suspect good things to come because the food is fantastic. We're excited to have this food option on the east side!"}
{"input": "Happy to have finally gone to this tiny restaurant serviced by the nicest family. The mix of dishes recommended were tasty, a familiar cross of Vietnamese and Thai, though sweeter and less spicy IMHO. My fave was the Prah Hok Kateeh, apparently a recipe of grandma's. And a beef dish that included raw veggies, among them Thai eggplant, with an amazing dipping housemade dipping sauce made from roasted tomatoes. Oh, and remember, cash only."}
{"input": "The Peppermill is always making upgrades to their hotel to make it look better. But if you're a non smoker, good luck on making it through without getting second hand smoke cancer. They used to have these portable air purifiers all over the casino but they have steadily disappeared one by one over the last year for some ungodly reason. Now the place reeks of smoke. Just one walk through the casino and your hair and clothes will smell like cigarettes.  It makes it unbearable to sit at any machine and play for any substantial amount of time."}
{"input": "I work in many areas throughout the Tampabay area!  Today I happened upon this beautiful \"old friend\" and was thrilled to see it still standing and doing business!!!  I was pleasantly surprised as I walked through the main doors and found it to be just as it was but actually even more beautiful!!!  I was in a hurry to meet a client so I decided I was going to place a to go order...:I asked the hostess for a to go order menu and she handed me one and then as I was looking over the menu I expressed my excitement for this place that I once loved so long ago!!!!  She said and I quote \"ARE YOU GOING TO PLACE A TO GO ORDER OR NOT?\"  I very nicely handed the menu back to her and turned and left the restaurant!!!!!  Wow!!!!!!!!"}
{"input": "I frequent this location but the staff here is getting as bad as the Clayton location. I know it is late & you have two tables but you're in a service industry people. Need I mention your job is also your choice. Sorry for the inconvenience of giving you a paycheck. \n\nNext time don't slam my food down. Next time don't reach across my face multiple times. Next time, ask me if I want anything else before you bring my check. \n\nThe food is mediocre so if the service keeps declining; I'll go elsewhere. This is Saint Louis after all!"}
{"input": "This place is awesome! It's beautiful! There is a lot of parking and hiking trails which lead straight to the beach. We came here because of the hot dog stand. Recommend that place for a quick bite before heading to Santa Barbara."}
{"input": "Used to be good when it first opened.  Quality has gone downhill.  Ordered the mango salad which came out with apples instead.  (no explanation provided)  Food is mediocre - have been there about 5 or 6 times since it opened but not returning even though it is walking distance from our house."}
{"input": "Wonderful establishment with a great selection of always super fresh seafood.  Their in season soft shell crabs are melt in your mouth good.  Hands down the best local fish monger in Bucks County, well worth the drive to Buckingham."}
{"input": "Favorite place to go in New Orleans. Chill backyard bar with great local music options.\n\nSmaller groups are better- seating can get tight. The wine and cheese bar up front services the live music venue in back. You can pick 3 or more cheeses and they put together a lovely cheese and accoutrements tray for you. You can also choose a wine to open up in the back. Wines have a great selection, mid-range price (almost all winces over $10-20 a bottle).\n\nGreat place to spend the night and have a wonderful time away from the packed tourists hot spots. (Mind you, this place is well known and a hot spot itself)."}
{"input": "I came here on business, the people were great. The food was excellent, my only issue was the ambient music was good but drowned out by people singing Kareoke or live entertainment in the bar...between the two musics going it sounded like a mish mash where you couldnt enjoy one or the other.  I informed the owner and he was very accomodating and turned down the music in the main restaurant in order to alleviate the noise attenuation."}
{"input": "Great location, great food, and friendly staff! There are only a few seats and the store gets pretty crowded with people waiting for their food. I saw a lot of online order ready to go at the counter and think that would be the smart move the next time I want to come during a weekday lunch rush. Weather permitting, it's great to grab some HCV and eat it in Rittenhouse Square across the street! I've come a few times with friends and coworkers and no one has complained about their choices (vegetarians and meat eaters alike)!"}
{"input": "Fantastic restaurant!  Consistently great food and atmosphere!  Great place for a catered party or a romantic evening with your wife!"}
{"input": "I didn't know what to expect when I got there but it was incredible.  Lots of varieties on food and alcohol.  Macaroni and cheese is to die for.  \nNot expensive either.  Definitely a great place."}
{"input": "Food good but music so loud it's hard to hear you're friends talking. Also it's a bit of mayhem when you have to wait in line to order and pay. Cuban sandwich is delish."}
{"input": "So helpful & they had everything we needed for an event. Being from out of town, I had to make my choices by phone and online. They helped make everything super-easy. Once I got there, they had everything ready for me & helped me try everything on. \nThe costumes were so cute & authentic and were a big hit at the event. Remember Me was just what we needed!"}
{"input": "Awesome local brunch if you can wait the 30 - 90 minute wait. I like to walk around the neighborhood while I wait, great garage sales nearby usually. \n\nFrench toast is yummy and so are the potato pancakes."}
{"input": "I thought about writing something witty and entertaining but then I read what Scott S. wrote and his review was such a slam dunk, I figure why bother? \n\nMy one word contribution: Amazeballs."}
{"input": "What a find! Great food, reasonable prices and great atmosphere. I had the fish tacos, though I wish I would have ordered the shrimp one's after I took a bite of my husband's. I got a side order of the battered green beans. They were suppose to be spicy, but I was told they didn't make them spicy that particular day. Well, okay then. I ordered them anyways and I was so glad that I wasn't deterred by the fact that they weren't spicy because they were the most lightly battered, perfectly crunchy, and delicious green beans I have ever tasted. To top it off, the beautiful Santa Barbara County day made the outdoor ambiance the most perfect date for my husband and I."}
{"input": "This is the best pizza in Indianapolis. It's the only pizza that tastes like pizza should that we've ever ordered anywhere in the city. The key is the crust. The second key is their sauce. It's real pizza, with real pizza taste. Most people in Indy don't know what pizza is. Once they go here that will change ! I highly recommend the white pizza with your choice of toppings. I prefer black olives and pepperoni but order the white for a little something different and you won't go wrong !!"}
{"input": "Mellow Mushroom.... what a cool name!!  And the restaurant has mushrooms everywhere in it... cartoon mushrooms all over the walls... it's pretty awesome!\n\nThe pizza is really good and the crust is very tasty!  \n\nOnly complaints are: 1) when getting take out, the pizza doesn't stay very hot.  and 2) when it's closing time, they really do lock the door and don't pay attention to you if you are waiting outside to pick up your take out order.\n\nother than that... Mellow Mushroom is pretty cool!"}
{"input": "Great food and hot cooks who you can stare at openly. Party. The feta and pita are famous but the fried quail is where it's at. Great jump off point"}
{"input": "Worth it we have been going to the Crabby Bills Group for over 30 years! And its still pretty damn good!"}
{"input": "The grits and mac and cheese were incredible. Hot chicken sandwich was pretty bad. The chicken was so over cooked and parts of it were inedible. Won't be back, there's better BBQ elsewhere."}
{"input": "As far as cheese goes, they have a good selection, but I would usually go next door.  The mozzerela is good, but often times sold out.  I believe they only make cows milk and not buffalo mozzerela, which is not my favorite.\nFor bread, again I would go next door as well.\nFor groceries, they have the best stock in the market.  However the prices are pretty bad.  If you are in a jam and need a single Italian cooking ingredient, they probably have it, but you're probably over paying.\nThe staff is very friendly and helpful.  They hang a lot of meat at the counter, so the interaction at the counter is awkward because you're looking around hanging meat."}
{"input": "This is the worst Taco Bell there is, and sadly, the only one open past 10, and sometimes 9 depending on how the others feel that day. I guess it's just a Nevada thing, or a Reno thing, but the Taco Bell's here are a joke and this is the worst. Been sitting in the drive-thru for 10 minutes only to be told the item I wanted isn't offered anymore, even though commercials are still playing for it. They've forgotten our food more than once, and I personally won't eat here (wife is the hopeful for it because she loves Taco Bell) because it's given us both food poisoning.\n\nGo to Del Taco, same food poisoning, but you'll actually get your food in a timely manner, probably."}
{"input": "Very tasty sushi and very reasonably priced. Service was quick. 1 specific suggestions for improvement: menu photos\n\nAuthentic flavor and ultra healthy"}
{"input": "I'm always amazed when sour-pusses write bad reviews of wonderful restaurants. \n\nIf you like delicious food and really, really nice people, you will LOVE this place. \n\nIf you are grumpy and always find a reason to hate everything, you'll probably feel the same about this place as you do about the rest of your life."}
{"input": "Delicious both the burritos and Vietnamese! Come often for Pho and great Vietnamese food, but tried a burrito today for the first time! I am hooked!"}
{"input": "I just recently moved to Tampa and was worried I wouldn't be able to find Thai food as good as back home. The Thai fried rice and cashew nuts sautéed chicken were amazing! We keep coming back for more. Only downside is the lack of ambiance and very small eating area. Can feel crowded if busy."}
{"input": "Sooo good I love this place literally All the flavors are good but the bees knees is amazing it's lavender and honey I strongly suggest that you should go there"}
{"input": "I had a horrible experience here. The waiter was great but as I got my appetizer, there was it has a hair in it.\nNext the noodles came out mine was fine but my friend has a huge hair in his. I thought he was joking until he told me. After that it ruined my appetite, I gave the noodles back and they didn't even give me a new one, I thought I should've got the food for free at that point.. never eating here again"}
{"input": "Wow, the BBQ Shrimp was killer.  Definitely a must.  Ted and Dwayne did a great job as servers.    I would come back for sure.  The decor is nice and the atmosphere pleasant."}
{"input": "I doubted I could find flavorful pho in New Orleans, but boy was I wrong. The beef pho broth is 10x richer and more savory than any I've tried in the San Francisco Bay Area. Really hit the spot after a week of eating nothing but biscuits, gumbo, and blood marys.\n\nThe owner, Lilly, was so kind to us, even ordering us a cab so that we'd make it to our next engagement on time. \n\nClean bathrooms.\n\nWould come here again in a heartbeat!"}
{"input": "My husband and I stopped by to try Angelo's gyros and philly cheese steak. This visit we opted for just the main items. We did not get a fries. Both items were big. I felt that you got what you paid for. My gyro was stuffed with beef. Some of the meat was dried out. The tzatziki sauce tasted like plain yogurt and sour cream mixed together. I like my tzatziki sauce to have dill, parsley or mint flavor to it. I would have been happy with any seasoning. The sub was also packed with beef. My husband said it was decent sub. We are both going to go there again maybe during the day when the kitchen is busy and items are fresher."}
{"input": "I was in the neighborhood so I thought I'd stop buy to pick up some pork butt and some pork fat for making some sausage.  They actually argued with me and wouldn't go to the back to grab me the fat.  They had no idea that I was not making pork sausage but just using it as a filler meat to get up to the correct weight for the recipe.\nI should have known the quality of the business when I walked in and all of the refrigerated displays were empty and the only other customer in there was only picking up jugs of water lol."}
{"input": "Literally, the worst Taco Bell I have ever been to. The restaurant is filthy, the service is awful, and they didn't make any of our order correctly, and really, how hard is that?  I won't be back and if I were you I would find a different place to go."}
{"input": "Just watched the final of the World Cup here. Great food, great drinks, and good people. The Crunchy Burger and the hand cut fries are awesome."}
{"input": "The last few times that I went get my nails done, the service was not good.\nI got extensions, and the gel nails came off after 2 days. I went back to fix it, and they put an unmatched color on , I was really upset.\n\nOtherwise I never had to wait long for my nails get done, and there is a lady ( Linda) that works there she is Great I truly recommend you make an appointment with her."}
{"input": "Very impressed! The price was right! The room was excellent, with two comfy queen beds and a very nice kitchenette! Very clean and nice decor! The only bad part was that we could hear the people outside at the hotel patio bar and we were on the fourth floor! Would definitely stay here again!"}
{"input": "First off all the really good local restaurants are closed on Sunday nights so we ended up in the tourist trap water front area for dinner. Went to Oliver's with a party of 8. We had a variety of entrees from the menu and all I can say is for $40 per person (total bill including the already added 18% gratuity and tax and a $40 bottle of wine) what a disappointment. Took 45 min to get our food, and of the 6 different dishes only 1 had any real flavor (ravioli). If you're looking for bland and slow close to the quarter this is the place to go."}
{"input": "Ordered from grubhub waited an hour and a half for delivery so I called naturally no one picked up for another 20 minutes then when the guy answers his explanation was that they were on break and hadn't made my order yet and gave me the \" oh well\" attitude and didn't offer any kind of compensation."}
{"input": "I haven't been here since before I could drive so I had no idea what I was getting into ha. But the process is super easy. 1-Parking! You can park for free in their parking garage and then take the sky bridge over into the museum. 2-tickets! You can buy online or there. 3- the museum! There are four or fiveish levels with different activities per floor. There's anywhere from mummies and dinosaurs to culture and science to a chocolate slide. Almost everything is free, the carousel costa a dollar to ride and you have to get a token out of a machine. But of course it's crazy full of kids and parents and learning. We went during a weekday and it wasn't too crazy. Makes for a very fun 3-4 hours running around."}
{"input": "Sunshine swim school provides excellent instruction through their small group classes.  They allow kids to move at their own pace through the 14 levels, whether it means repeating a level or advancing quickly by skipping levels.  Even though there are often 3 kids in each small class, they do provide enough individual instruction for kids to learn the skills they need.  \n\nMy main issue is how expensive these swim lessons are.  At around $12 per 25 minutes, this is by far the most expensive activity I have ever enrolled my kids in. Swim lessons are twice as expensive as gymnastics, and far more than seasonal sports.  However, it is worth it for the quality of instruction and how quickly my kids became comfortable in the water and learned strokes.  My 10 year old is expected to complete the highest level in the program by the end of this summer, and it is only the second season we will have been attending Sunshine Swim School."}
{"input": "Great omelets and grits. We try to stop here when in the area for breakfast. Pretty yummy and nice wait staff too. It's worth the trip to this place if you're looking for a great breakfast. Probably lunch too but all we've had here was breakfast."}
{"input": "The service was great, the server was pleasant and refilled our drinks frequently. Any good southerner knows keeping that sweet tea coming is a must on a warm summer day! The sampler platter was a great way to see the flavors of the chef's special dishes. It comes with gumbo, étouffée, and jambalaya pasta. The chicken piccata was good as well. The desserts looked great but we were too full to eat them. Next time I'll have to save room though."}
{"input": "Sandwiches are great here!  They have a decent menu with a variety of food types. Lunch time gets crowded, but that's downtown Philly.  The jambalaya was tasty and just the right amount of kick.  I'd definitely go back."}
{"input": "Mussels in coconut curry sauce were fantastic.  The scallops melted in your mouth. Excellent service and a very extensive beer and drink menu.  Don't  miss it if you are in philadelphia."}
{"input": "Gooooo Eagles! Thank you for giving us our first superbowl. With Carson Wentz inside the 20 he's dangerous and invincable. Nick Foles is damaging relife. With LaGarret Blount on the infield, Zack Ertz(TE) on the midfield, and Jay Ajai on the outfield, one day we might have a perfect 16-0"}
{"input": "This place has delicious wine, sweet simple ambiance, and the sommeliers are friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"input": "Fast food Korean style. Simple clean flavors, a small menu for the indecisive, and a cute interior and even some outside seating. Great if you are in a rush. Homemade  sauces are delicious."}
{"input": "Neat place in the Funk Zone of Santa Barbara.... good selection of beers.... friendly staff.  Like having the taster option which they do offer.  It was another beautiful way to spend a Sunday!!!  Hope to return soon."}
{"input": "I love my  curly perm from Shine hair & nails ! Thanks Harvey! You're the best! :D"}
{"input": "Amazing burgers, craft beers, specialty cocktails and homemade ice cream desserts.  The burgers you have choices of substituting beef, chicken, lamb or bison. They put a spin on everything...even the ketchup. They even have a weekly burger battle where the most ordered burger lives on another week to get challenged by another special contender. \n\nMy son and I spilt a banana split that was simply incredible. A scoop of triple chocolate and one of coconut crunch with a caramelized banana...get outta here!!! You know the melty part of a banana split at the bottom of the bowl that nobody likes...we didn't find it here!!!!"}
{"input": "Great place. Like the loud energy and crowd here. As far as burgers go, this is one of the best I've had I'm STL.\n\nI got the patty melt with chilli cheese fries, both great although I wish the cheese on the fries were real cheese not cheese sauce.\n\nAlso tried the 3 chilli chocolate shake. Spicy!"}
{"input": "DISCLAIMER: this review is limited exclusively to my single experience last night eating prawn mee noodle soup at Penang.\n\nReview: this dish was admittedly very fishy, which I was generally okay with. It almost tasted like the restaurant added fermented shrimp paste or something similar. That's also not an issue, in itself. However, it is now 8pm, and I have still not yet left my hotel room since getting back from Penang last night. I'm currently having the absolute worst food poisoning experience of my life.  According to my primary care physician, aka WebMD, it is likely that I have some form of aggressive salmonella food poisoning.\n\nThe other dishes looked good, and I'm sure the prawn mee is typically not vomit/diarrhea-inducing, but i hope this issue is addressed promptly."}
{"input": "There are few truly great lunch places in Old CIty Philadelphia - if you are looking for a sandwich this probably the best.  The pulled pork is absolutely amazing, servers and beer list well informed, and sides worth being a main attraction all their own."}
{"input": "The friendly staff really make this hotel a pleasure to stay in!"}
{"input": "Once, my salad had dirt in it. Seriously.\n\nIt was like it was plucked from the ground that very moment and didn't get a bath.\n\nOh well. I ordered the Kogut's Curry - roasted chicken, melted Swiss and cheddar with curried mayonnaise on Russian black bread. It was mighty greasy, but mighty tasty too, and if there was dirt in it, it blended in with the bread.\n\nI've since been here for their farmer dinners, where a local farmer sources the produce/meat/cheese and they create a special meal around the ingredients. It was lovely. Eggplant stuffed with goat cheese and tomatoes and sauteed summer squash from Biver Farms.\n\nI've obviously gotten over my dirt phobia. Just proves the food here is farm fresh. I'm pulling for the clean, farm fresh approach, though."}
{"input": "Poor selection of slot machines.\n\nTried the buffet and had bad service. Never had anyone check up on me or even get me a refill with an empty cup sitting on the table over half an hour. Food was also not good quality. Also felt sick the next day.\n\nWent to a concert and it was delayed but they did not allow the band to play their full set.\n\nI would still come back for concerts but not for any other reason. Also I would eat off property first."}
{"input": "The Block in Webster is always a solid option for a good meal. They have a great happy hour, which keeps me coming back. I don't think I've ever had a bad meal here, but the reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is that it used to be better. The menu used to have more small plates/appetizers and the deserts haven't been as good lately as they used to. However, we always get good service and enjoy ourselves."}
{"input": "Found this place on Yelp. The reviews speak for themselves and are so true. The sandwiches are really tasty. Definitely worth the wait in line. Fast and friendly service. We waited about 15 minutes in line, ordered 4 different sandwiches, filled up our sodas, walked out to our table, and our sandwiches were delivered to us as we say down. We enjoyed our meal."}
{"input": "This place is situated inside of a building, not easily seen from the street. Food is good, not over priced. Service is friendly and efficient. Comfortable and casual. Good place. 35$ for 3 people."}
{"input": "This place is always pretty darn busy. The ambiance of the shop itself isn't amazing as a result as it's mostly folks waiting around for their bubble tea. But oh my goodness they're fast and their red bean bubble tea was absolutely delicious upon my last visit! Red Bean is always my favourite so I was pleasantly surprised that their version was even more delicious than expected."}
{"input": "I love this place.  Love the Dan Dan noodles, dried pepper shrimp, and wontons.   Service is great.  If you want a great dining experience with excellent food, you must try this place."}
{"input": "I have had the pleasure of working with, and getting to know, the entire \"Family\" and team of Bella Vista Designs over the past 16 years.  They are my number one, go-to lighting and event production company. They are always friendly on the phone, quick with their proposals and efficient with any and all correspondence. I have even annoyingly texted their personal phones during out of office hours and received responses to my frantic questions.  They work extremely hard to ensure that all of my events are done well and thoroughly.  If there is ever an issue, they immediately send someone out to correct the problem. The owner, Trevor, has even driven over an hour out to a job-site, to personally ensure that my event was taken care of. I have gotten to know their setup crew well, and they go above and beyond in horrific wet weather, summer heat, muddy and dusty grounds. They even help with things that tent even their job sometimes! They are amazing at what they do and I highly recommend them!"}
{"input": "Great Breakfast and service. Sunny side skillet (under $8) with a pancake was delicious! Atmosphere and store selections well above all other locations."}
{"input": "The food is good, especially if you are looking for delivery nearby. Their prices are a little high, though."}
{"input": "Never again!!! \nThis ceviche was not fresh. And the corn nut were stale. Very gross.not to mention it took 25 minutes to get our check so we could leave. The other waitress could not even find out waitress."}
{"input": "I came with a party of 4, (including myself). This place is okay! We got 1 Stretch Armstrong, man, it was cheesy. I had way too much cheese. The Sally, was good, but nothing special. The 2 people in my party, got the Margherita, it was like your typical pizza shop, good, but average. The pizza wasn't anything to write home about. Really expensive, too. Cherry soda, was good, (at least). All members of my party, got that."}
{"input": "If you've never visited Eats, you are missing out. I judge ever place by their burgers and Eats does not disappoint. The V-Jack is a gut busting, juice dripping, artery clogging, tongue pleasing work of art. Two real beef patties, BBQ pork, cheese and BACON. It's just incredible.. The apps are super tasty as well.\nWe've always experienced superb service by a fun group of waitstaff. The kind of waitstaff that actually enjoy their jobs and make you feel extremely comfortable."}
{"input": "My mother and I stopped in here for lunch upon recommendations from friends. I tried the Daily Bread Special and she had the Veggie. We both loved our sandwiches! We also split a bowl of Turkey Noodle soup. That was a nice complement to our meal. We bought a Gooey Butter Cake, too, which was absolutely outstanding. \n\nOnly gripe was marginally friendly staff and a very slim variety of chips. \n\nDefinitely give the Daily Bread a try!"}
{"input": "Food was awful.  We sat down and waited for everything.  Our waiter left in the middle of the service, it took 20 minutes to get an orange juice.\n\nBathrooms were disgusting and the restaurant was not even full.  A bad experience all around."}
{"input": "Hands down one of the best dining experiences ever, and this was with 10 people. \n\nGreat pompano, great salad, great cocktails, great service.  The Pompano Broussards was seriously one of the best pieces of fish I've ever had, seasoned well, a light - not overpowering - sauce, flaky and not over done.  \n\nOutstanding service, beautifully appointed dining room.  What I expected dining in the French Quarter to be like.\n\nGO HERE."}
{"input": "Well you get what you pay for I guess.  The front desk staff were actually very professional and helpful. But, it went downhill from there.  The first room smelled like smoke.   The front desk staffed man was nice enough to run the key up to a new room, which made it right, but then the new room TV malfunctioned.  They just cut corners.   One washcloth,  shampoo but no conditioner. The bed was pillows were decent so like I said you get what you pay for."}
{"input": "Experienced this restaurant 8-04-2013 with friends. We decided to sit in the courtyard, which had a lovely ambiance. However the the square table for four was much more suited to a table for two, really felt cramped.\n\nThe wines we chose were really good we had the cabernet sauvignon and our friend had the malbec which she really enjoyed.\n\nFor Dinner I chose the Salmone Campagnolo, the mash potatoes were great however the salmon was definately overcooked and very dry and lacked flavor. Everyone else chose the Saltimbocca, which was also nothing special, have had better on the hill.\n \nVisited August 2013"}
{"input": "The food was outstanding.  I got chicken tagine, with the delicious tender meat falling off the bone, and carrot salad, flavored with mint and cumin.  Service was good, and the inside of the restaurant is cheerful and well-lit.  Total cost was around $13."}
{"input": "Their salsa was flavorless. To many green peppers in the fijitas compared to the onion and the chicken was dry.  Had to ask for more torrtias because the first ones where dried out. The kid who brought out the food didn't warn is how hot the plates where. My food was just pay. And by the way no Tolet seat in the men's room."}
{"input": "Always good, very consistent. We eat here almost weekly and have never had a negative experiance. It is in a small strip center with a very basic interior. The food is the main attraction and it is worth the trip."}
{"input": "This place is GREAT and worth all 5-stars.  We wanted a big breakfast and we got it.  We ordered the fried green tomato BLT, sweet cream pancakes, and the country creole breakfast.  As my 8 year old daughter said- \"it was delightful!\"  This is a must while in NOLA!"}
{"input": "Good food.  Cute interior. Cuban sandwich was good, but nothing like Tia's in St. Pete. Beans were good.  The fries were excellent.  Cooked perfect."}
{"input": "the handmade orangina is delicious-better than the bottled version! and the croissant sandwiches are amazing!"}
{"input": "Oh I really do love this place. I'm so glad my son and I went last Sunday. We had the German town west Benny, an eggs Benedict with smoked salmon, and the bananas foster pancakes. The food was incredible and service was great. For us, the cozy converted house with wooden floors, art on the walls and music playing made our visit just extra special! Oh and the southern pecan coffee..where ya been all my life?! This is a must for when in Nashville."}
{"input": "It's eye candy simply  walking into this place! I have picked up cookies, cupcakes and small cakes (no large orders) from this bakery.  \n\nThere are always samples out and the staff is friendly.  \n\nYou will pay a little more here as this is a traditional bakery focused on artisan-created baked goods. \n\nYou can just stop in and they have a number of cakes ready to customize for you!\n\nMy only suggestion is adding gluten-free items or making them more visible. They might also highlight lower-calorie items (or a small section) too. Buy hey, this is a bakery! :)"}
{"input": "Excellent breakfast fare. I have been there twice and I am hooked. I tried their new omelette with mozzarella cheese, and the salmon beni. Both were great. \n\nMy only recommendation to the owners is to get an espresso machine and add espresso based drinks to their menu. That should be an easy addition and would really complement their offerings very well!"}
{"input": "The owner helped me resolve my problem. They were amazing when I can back in to get my hair done. I definitely advise contacting the business and letting them know you are unhappy and see if they will work with you. Thank you so much."}
{"input": "I came in about a month ago because I was a new Verizon customer having trouble activating my new Galaxy S7 Edge. 3 of the male employees made an awesome group effort to figure out the issue (turns out my old phone company was taking forever to release my phone # for porting over to VZW). They took their time, making several phone calls until they figured out the problem. One of them installed a Zagg screen protector for me and another even pointed out that I qualified for a FREE TV with my phone purchase! I wish I could remember their names (I think one was Mario?), but hopefully they know who they are and that their customer service is appreciated!"}
{"input": "A perfect afternoon in the gulch for me would consist of a shopping spree at Blush, a beer at Hops and Crafts and lunch at Turnip Truck.\n\nI mean sure it's an interesting grocery store, but have you tried their ever rotating hot buffet or their made to order sandwiches? \nTasty!! Or how about some of their all natural beauty products and lip balms? Score!!\n\nYou could spend half a day perusing aisle upon aisle of organic fair. This place makes Whole Foods look like Walmart. \n\nMy only complaint: I just wish they would bring back a rewards program of some sort. Guess it was fun while it lasted. \n\nMy usual lunch order; chipotle chicken salad wrap on whole wheat with chipotle mayo."}
{"input": "The vealchop is a must, as is the burrata appetizer. The staff is very knowledgeable of the menu as well as the surrounding areas. Definitely a highlight of our trip."}
{"input": "Worst sushi place ever! First there was a bug on my roll then when they brought it back it was spoiled.  The manager asked me if I ever ate sushi before. My husband food was cold the waitress said it was just made but that was so far from true.  DO NOT EAT AT THIS PLACE!!! 2 THUMBS DOWN"}
{"input": "I like this place.  Unique sandwiches, and it's definitely the best place to go if you want a healthy option or have vegan friends."}
{"input": "Best place to learn to swim! The teachare are so nice and professional. My daughter has been swimming there for a couple of years now and she loves it! The management is great too, tuition is pro-rated during holidays when the pool is closed and they always give us make-up classes when we miss a class. Great swim school!"}
{"input": "Everytime I pass by here, which is practically once a day, I remember the meals we had for dinner.  Or, perhaps more accurately, I  remember that we didn't like Sunset 44 precisely because the dinner was so unmemorable--- so very, terribly bland. No flavor, no pizzaz, no zing. Absolutely nothing to bring us back."}
{"input": "Ok well I'd heard so much about this place i had to try it. Well NEVER AGAIN! Dirty Dirty Dirty! Rude service. Chicken parm outrageous over priced. N never in life had chicken parm covered in black pepper. Would of sent back if waiter ever came back to table. Bread was so old n when asked for new i was questioned if i new what i was talking about. Well since i grew up in the food industry. I think i know. N from dirty table clothes. Too dirty glasses not once but 2x give up on clean one. If it wasn't for husband stopping me complaining right then u would of heard it all in person. I know restaurant have off nights. But this was beyond OFF."}
{"input": "Okay, in general, Trader Joe and I are good buddies. There are things you can find cheaper here than at a larger chain supermarket, and I've yet to find something of their brand that isn't decent. \n\nThis one in particular is small but mighty. There's a respectable wine and beer section, quite the array of cheeses (which is a huge reason you go to a Trader Joe's type grocery, let's be honest)*, and solid offerings of both prepared or cut and whole produce.\n\nChampagne grapes for cheap. So happy.\n\n\n*If this is just me, I'm going to go ahead and say the rest of you are doing it wrong. Goat gouda. Come on."}
{"input": "It is a good experience, so give it a try.\n\nWhen you walk in you can tell it is slightly more upscale than its surroundings.  It's near the bourbon street area, and most of that are bars and entertainment.\n\nMr. B's is that white table cloth kind of place and the servers all look like they are in suits.  The atmosphere is nice, and fairly casual.\n\nThe food is pretty good.  They have a pork and fig entree...the pork was very tender, but there wasn't enough of the fig to really make a difference.  There is also a pork chop entree that is really good, but not as tender as the pork and fig.\n\nThe bbq shrimp was really good....they give you a bib so you don't splatter on yourself.  \n\nThey had a fish special of the night which was a drum....never heard of that kind of fish, but it was also really good.\n\nOverall,  good place.  I recommend trying it"}
{"input": "Stumbled upon this place while visiting from TX. Small selection but VERY good! So fresh, organic, and absolutely delicious!  Yummy cheese quesadillas for the kids and the tuna & chicken salad is extra tasty! The owner/chef was super friendly and polite.  Definite A+ for fabulous customer service! Great quiet, clean place to catch a healthy bite to eat!!"}
{"input": "I was in a pinch after getting my keys swiped by someone I was helping out. Gordon was extremely competent and professional in guiding me through what services I should seek out, getting the locks re-keyed as opposed to the more expensive option of getting all new locks. He arrived promptly on time and delivered excellent service. I highly recommend you selecting this company for any of your locksmith needs."}
{"input": "Great pizza! Worth the wait and atmosphere, don't expect good service esp on the weekends. If you are eating there call your pizza in before you get there! Seriously! Call or you will get annoyed on the wait.  It's a dive."}
{"input": "This bakery has amazingly talented chefs!  So far they have delivered a superb product that not only looks GREAT, but tastes sooo good.  The women are wonderful,  the prices are really good, and it's nice and clean inside.  They did a phenomenal job on my husband's 50th birthday cake and a super AWESOME job on my nephews Birthday cupcake cake.  I was just so overwhelmed by the beautiful job they did, and everyone at both parties were in aww of how great the designs came out.  I just cannot say enough about this bakery, and the wonderful job they do!"}
{"input": "Always worth the wait. Filling this review out after I've gone a few times (5-6 times). Immaculate baked goods, inspiring latte combinations, creative soulful brunch food. I recommend grabbing a latte and a baked good to munch on while you wait. \n\nI've had few dishes I haven't loved.  I normally find it hard to narrow down the options, I normally ask the wait staff bc there always seems to be a few dishes that rise above the others. The sorghum bacon is always pretty impressive and a crowd pleaser and I've definitely ordered a few different versions of the Dutch baby. Happy brunching!"}
{"input": "I love their eggs! Their eggs taste better than any other restaurant eggs I've ever had. We always get the hash. Dawn Patrol is always super generous with the food portioning...with the hash, that is. My brother got a burger to go, and all it was was a piece of meat between two buns. However, he said the burger was really good, but still, I feel that they could've melted some cheese on top of the patty. All of their pastries, bread and jellies are homemade - and really delicious!"}
{"input": "Food is bomb.  Plus good servers.  Right by river.  You have nothing to lose and everything to gain by eating here."}
{"input": "The location is pretty random (at the end of a long winding road with a bunch of other hotel off of the highway with no food nearby) and the building has seen better days.  \n\nMy room featured an unclean floor, torn wallpaper, dusty bathroom vents, and water spots in the bathroom.  The hallways might remind one of \"red rum\" and the building itself is ugly showing it's age as a product of the 70s (as am I so I can judge).\n\nThe bed was comfortable and the room serviceable but it was disappointing as I have grown accustomed to a higher level of quality in my Doubletree experience throughout the country."}
{"input": "We wanted to check this place out after seeing the great reviews. \nArrived on Thursday (New Years Day) around noon and the place was packed with a hour and a half wait. We put our name in and went next door for a drink, \nThe restaurant texted us when our table was ready and also had a cool app that you can check your place in line. \nOnly had drinks and a few apps. The tuscan fries were good but had a LOT of garlic.\nMy friend loved her Kale salad. \nIf you like a bloody mary, try the cucumber mary made with cucumber vodka. It was unbelievable. \n\nThis was hands down out favorite place in Nashville and this place had the BEST service we got our whole trip. A+ to the staff. We were really really impressed. \nWe went back on Friday night around 1am and it was pretty empty. The guy sitting next to us said its really a better brunch or Sunday Funday bar and not busy at night."}
{"input": "Not the cheapest around but you get what you pay from some shadetree mechanics. Medford Car Care offers great service and they are conveniently located in town. They fix the problem right the first time and communicate with you so you understand what is going on with your vehicle. I have used them for numerous cars over the years and never had an issue with Medford Car Care."}
{"input": "Not the best prepared sushi inthe city by a longshot, but for quick (and I mean quick), cheap sushi with a long menu, Mixx is great."}
{"input": "I really enjoyed my meal here, I was eating alone and there was no WiFi but I actually felt very comfortable! The food is incredibly cheap, I can't remember everything I got but I had a full meal, with dessert, one non-alcoholic cocktail and iced tea with refills and I swear it only came to about 12 dollars! The Cotton Candy drink is insane, so so sweet but so tasty! Could do with a shot of vodka.... :P \nThe service was great and they kept me happy all evening. \nI did have some upset stomach that night but as I had been travelling for the previous two days I'm pretty sure it had nothing to do with the meal, I was just wrecked and probably ate too much. \nGrand spot!"}
{"input": "Due to the look (and price) of this hotel, top notch is important to their brand. The hotel was able to accommodate over 3000 employees from all over the country seamlessly. They served us very well and even decorated it to the 9's!"}
{"input": "First time ever walking into one of these stores. It is a mixture of bohemian chic and modern flare. I liked their clothing selection. What really drew my attention was home section. There were some interesting pieces, and owl bowl, foliage places, mini milk jugs etc."}
{"input": "Food is so-so for specializing in Malaysian cuisine.\n\nService can be rude at times... if you really want Malaysian food try Banana Leaf around the corner and save yourself the agony of tipping on poor service."}
{"input": "i dont know what has happened to the in store service in this place!  We have been down here for a few weeks now and have been here 6 times.Only once was the order completed without a screw up!\n\nToday 2 tall decaf coffees took close to 20 minutes.By then our bagels were cold.First i was told the decaf was \"brewing' and then i was told there was something 'wrong\" with the brewer? After 15 minutes i was offered a decaf americano.\nBefore we left i politely told a fellow behind the counter the service was abominable and he said 'well we can only store 2 vente size decafs at a time? HUH? I asked if the management knew about this and he just shrugged.\nClearly this staff has never been trained to make it right for the customer.No apology.No coupon.Just a convoluted story.\n \nAmazing how you can have numerous people running around a store but you cant get the simplest order straight My next visit to a Starbucks will certainly not be this one."}
{"input": "Nice cafeteria like place. The menu is very limited. It's a different take on tacos. Kind of like southern food in a soft taco shell. The shrimp corn chowder soup was delish also."}
{"input": "Not to bad. I sat at the bar and the bartender was awesome. The lunch menu here is very decent and the beer is ice cold.  I usually come during lunch when it isn't to congested. So, to get consistent service,  go when it isn't to congested. I will definitely go back?"}
{"input": "I love, love, love this place.  Great food, excellent beer selection, friendly people.  And it's just around the corner from me!"}
{"input": "The good burgers and capable bar cant overcome the family dinner experience - noisy with lots of children. Maybe we went to early and will try a later time on our next visit"}
{"input": "Hidden gem. My wife & I ate here twice on our trip to Tucson. Great bread, good breakfast food.  We had to limit ourselves from gorging on all the delicious baked sweets.  Service was friendly and you can tell that they take pride in what they do. Very affordable too."}
{"input": "I would have given this 4-stars when it was operated under its former name (which escapes me right now).  The food was still good, but gone are the outstanding individually made margaritas (now they're out of a machine a la \"Fat Tuesday\" style).  Also was a bit disappointed at our service while sitting at the bar...it was anything but crowded there, yet we waited a disproportionate amount of time for service.  Still not a bad place to go while in Phoenixville."}
{"input": "The rating is, \"As good as it get,\" but honestly I'm not sure because this was my first time eating Moroccan food.\n\nI ordered the Shawarma cus I like the way it sounds.  With every bite the sandwich got better and better.  I didn't want it to end.  \n\nMmmmm...kiss the cook\n\nStaff is friendly and answered questions...so plus 1 for that"}
{"input": "I'll put BCD up there with St Louis' best sandwiches.  Have been a fan since they opened, but don't get down nearly as much as I'd like.  Vince, the owner, is definitely putting his heart and soul into this place and it shows.  What I like best about BCD is that it is truly a neighborhood gem.  If you don't know it is there, you might miss it.  I think most people find it when they are looking for Hodak's Chicken (it is just down the street if coming from Gravois).  Anyway, I'm just echoing what everyone else has already said.  Awesome Sammies, awesome value, awesome music.  Can't wait for the annual summer block party!  Ask about the Blues City Dog...love that relish!"}
{"input": "My partner and I were out of towners for a wedding, which took place at Spasso's. It was such a good spot for a wedding dinner. The space was open, staff accommodating to our needs, we enjoyed the food and our glasses never ran empty. You could've rolled us out of there after our 5-course meal!"}
{"input": "Overall I thought it was a great experience. Service was a bit slow, but the bartenders were doing a good job. Burgers were tasty and fresh. I would definitely recommend this place to try. I would go back for sure the next time I am in the STL."}
{"input": "Good reviews are quite often written by employees to bring in the mass. Unfortunately, true statement and situations, such as mine, are never told due to that unsatisfied and upset customers just prefer to move on and forget their horrific visit. This location needs to greatly improve on food quality. I expressed my opinions to their Corp office and they said that they  would refund (me on a specific day when I received bad food) if I gave them a credit card # over phone or email. I paid cash! Why cc #?! Makes you say hummm! Then after several attempts to get my last visit refunded they finally offered a gift certificate which would be mailed to me. Did I get it you ask?...why, no, of coarse not. All in all, Pita J needs to go away. Liars put a bad taste in anyone's mouth. PJ - your food is sub-par at best. Too many options in area. Go elsewhere."}
{"input": "Kalamata's is a Greek and Mediterranean casual restaurant located near Green Hills mall. They have a good reputation for being a great place for a quick cheap bite. I prefer getting something here at Kalamata's over any  other fast food, because Kalamata's is really just as fast and the food is infinitely better, and the same price!  They have lunch specials that are really a bargain. \n\nI can't really comment on the authenticity, I've never been to Greece... but I think their food is full of flavor. I am a fan of the falafel here.  That's what I always like to order.  Get over to Kalamata's for lunch, try to come early or late to beat the rush though."}
{"input": "I don't think there is anything I can add that people haven't already said but I'll try. I've had my share of gourmet donuts and I can truly say that the Brown Butter Pistachio, Chocolate Glazed and the Cookies and Cream Donut are some of the best donuts had. The brown butter pistachio has a nice nutty flavor with slightly salty salty pistachios, the chocolate glazed is chocolatey yet not overwhelmingly sweet, in fact it's actually quite sinfully dark, and the cookies and cream is sweet and crunchy and delicious. Other than the donuts, I've tried their fries and the fries are delicious. The cheesy fries are good but the cheese has a slightly gritty feel to it. That's about the only thing keeping me from giving that a 5 star review. Over all it's a perfect place to grab lunch or dinner and a big ol' donut for dessert. Oh, and the free wifi and the ambiance is spot on!"}
{"input": "I'm pretty impressed with this place. Great food, yummy coffee, decent prices, awesome ambiance, not too much more one could ask for. The service goes above and beyond here, also, though perhaps it's because this location has only been open about a month. Sounds random, but the noise level is one of the stand out points for me here. I plan on going here often to read with a coffee.\nThe one downside is they have some nice seating outside, but it overlooks Oracle that feels weird. I hope they put up some latice or a small fence or something."}
{"input": "I'm from STL and sadly, I never had Ted Drewes until recently. I always see long lines so I figured I'd give it a try. I went to the location on South Grand and the ice was good but the service was terrible. The staff was rude and impatient while I tried to figure out what I wanted. Maybe I'll try the one on Hampton next time."}
{"input": "Great service and body work looked great.  They even vacuumed the inside.  Randy kept me up to date on the status through text so I knew what was going on with my car at all times."}
{"input": "Very cool store with fossils, crystals, geodes, stones, both finished and in raw form. A selection of jewelry, pendants and other interesting stones.  Broad selection of necklaces, sterling silver chains and rings.  This store rocks!"}
{"input": "Must have when in the Franklin area! Any Maki (roll) is absolutely well balanced fresh and so incredibly tasty. Bahamas Blue and Red Dragon rolls just the bomb Dudes and Dudettes. Don't miss the Hunter roll either. This place is in the top 5 in America for us and we are pushing triple digits for sushi restaurants. Perfect sushi rice as well!"}
{"input": "Another good addition to the Indy dining scene. Livery serves some delicious South American inspired food in a nice and lively setting. Cocktails are good too. Loved the empanadas! Can't wait to be back in a warmer weather so I can sit in their terrace upstairs.."}
{"input": "Gave this place another chance and definitely seems as though management has been working to improve it and it really shows. It's really great when management takes people opinions and critics and works to improve them. Well done!!!"}
{"input": "They have many menu items that no other restaurant in Tucson have.\nThe food are delicious & the service is good."}
{"input": "One of the worst places in Tucson!  Cold food , rude service. They have the right idea but fail to deliver"}
{"input": "My fiance and I come here pretty regularly as we live right down the road. We've always had good experiences. The servers are nice, the food is good and it's served pretty quickly. There are better Mexican restaurants in Indy, but this is one of the better in Avon/Brownsburg area."}
{"input": "We tried these at the Collingswood Art Festival this weekend. they are a bit pricey, but worth it. The flavor is perfect. they aren't greasy. I will be seeking them out. Once you try them... you will want to have them again. they are a light cheddar curd, battered and friend. You don't taste grease or batter. the flavor of the cheese is delicious, and so stringy and melty. The sauces are a delicate compliment to the curd. Well worth the splurge."}
{"input": "I like it I like it! !!! - because it's new business you have to \"understand\" they really get backed up & wait time can be 1-2 hrs. Yes- your heard correct. . Luckily I only waited 20 minutes from start to finish so, it wasn't too bad. Ice cream favor / presentation / temp / texture / creaminess 4 .... definitely worth the wait!!!!!!!!     I'm anticipating my next trip & pre planning what favors I like to try next. I know you'll enjoy it. ... they open everyday too"}
{"input": "Love the juicy steaks and fantastic service. Be weary, though that medium-rare is very rare. Almost raw. I learned this from my first time and consequently order medium from them on which was perfect for me. The sides are yummy and complement the steaks. This place is a bit pricey but worth the splurge.\n\nOne time, the waiter came back to return a tip because we didn't notice they already added gratuity to our large party. We thanked him and only took back part of it. That was very nice of him to do."}
{"input": "Needed a new set of catalytic converters on an older vehicle-- these guys hooked it up at a great price."}
{"input": "Outstanding! No pretending here. They have nothing but real ingredients.  Great options for smoothies and of course you can customize with add ins - like Maca, Moringa, Spirulina, etc. Wanted to try everything! Staff was very helpful and friendly!"}
{"input": "The people are cool and the sauces are good but other than that this place really doesnt have much going for it. Its just way too much like Taco Bell for me but with higher prices. I have to spend about $10 here just to get full, the portions simply arent that big, about Taco Bell size...and flavor for that matter. The decor reminds me of a McDonalds from 1988. The giant cookies are pretty blah. Pretty tasteless and unaplealing stuff here. If you like to spend a fortune trying to get full on Taco Bell like food then youll love it here. Only gave two stars cause the staff and music are cool."}
{"input": "I don't normally give a place 5 stars based on how good their food tastes, but that damn grilled chicken club is so ridiculously good.  I just couldn't help myself.\n\nThey also have a pretty good nacho appetizer.  I'm serious."}
{"input": "The food was amazing!! We tried a little bit of everything. Had the crawfish beignet, seafood stuffed mushrooms, crab cakes, crab cake po boy and seafood flatbread. Everything we had was delicious!"}
{"input": "I cant stand this hotel. I have had two very bad experiences here. I needed a room at 8pm one night and was going to be out by 5am and they were unwilling to accomodate or discount the rate. Im also a starwood member and they still were very unfriendly and I very un-accommodating. I would rather sleep in an alley then try to stay here again. They suck!"}
{"input": "Some of the best chocolate ice cream I've had! Fun atmosphere and impressive menu. Will definitely be back."}
{"input": "Nichole is the greatest. I love coming here and getting my hair done with her. I would highly recommend this place to anyone new to the area and looking for a new salon."}
{"input": "I had lunch buffet on Sunday. The food was alright. I wish the buffet trays were warmer. I think the best dishes were their fresh nans and green pea/paneer."}
{"input": "I had the Chicken Marsala recommended by our waiter. The chicken was very thin, tough, and dry. The pasta was under cooked and stuck together. There was absolutely no flavor. My friend ordered the lasagne and did not like it all. There was only a thin layer of pasta and no flavor. My other friend was still eating her dinner and they cleared her plate when she went to the restroom, after she told the waiter she was not finished. They did bring her a new meal in a doggie bag. The positives are a Great atmosphere and live music. I enjoyed dancing with my husband. However, very expensive for awful food."}
{"input": "Reviewing the food.\nHard to justify $16 for a burger and fries BUT wowow this burger was so delicious. I'm not sure if I was just starving but ordered the Lama burger and the patty size is quality. They also have random ingredients thrown in that you probably haven't seen before like gruyere stuffed in a pepper on your burger. Fries came out nice and crisp vs. soggy and the bun on that burger was great. You order inside by the Nook and then can sit around. They have tons of craft beer to choose from and I could see this place getting packed on the weekends."}
{"input": "We had the salmon, burger, and beer-brined chicken. Every item was excellent and cooked to perfection, a great improvement since I was here last, years ago. The herbed butter and sauces are amazing. They also have mastered pickled vegetables as well, something that enhances dishes that feature them, even in an ancillary role. \n\nOnce again, I'm tempted by the poutine. But it's 107 degrees today, and although the AC is great, it seems off to order it. One day.\n\nBy the way, if it's hot, have the drink called \"The Cooler\". It is worth it.\n\nOur tall server gentleman with the green eyes was great."}
{"input": "I have been getting waxed here for years and have been satisfied with the services. The staff is cordial and professional. Today, however, was something different. Tyisha is a gifted aesthetician. She is thorough and careful. The wax was the perfect temperature and the removal painless. This woman is a revelation. I had a new spring in my step walking out today! I'll never go to anyone else. Thank you Tyisha!"}
{"input": "After visiting with friends and indulging in lots of tastes, consider this my next order at Livery:\n\n(01) Carriage House Margarita with its brandy twist\n(02) All of the empanadas because I have no shame\n(03) The Red Drum - it's a lovely fish dish, and it's a way to get a taste of the yuca fries.\n(04) Churros (Take my advice and don't split 'em with anyone.)\n\nFeel free to copy my order on your visit."}
{"input": "Absolutely the best Chinese buffet in the state of Indiana! Always fresh and friendly. Great selection of food and desserts. Location is tucked away in a corner of a strip mall. Could use a face lift but don't change it by the appearance. Best stuffed mushrooms!"}
{"input": "This hotel is awesome!! Very close to Philly and tons of restaurants and shopping. The room was clean and comfortable. Got a great night sleep. The pillows and the bed was great. The hotel was quiet and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again."}
{"input": "I have been going to Shanghai for years.  I can tell you that the food is consistent and good.  If you want gourmet Chinese food then go to PF Changs.  This is a neighborhood place and it's the standard place for my family's takeout.  My favorite is the General Tso's Chicken, Chicken and Broccoli, and the Hot & Sour soup.  As for the reviewer that complained about rodent traps.  Most restaurants have rodents! How do you think exterminators stay in business?\n\nUpdate:  Just had lunch and they did a total renovation of the restaurant.  Very nice!"}
{"input": "I have been here a many times now.  Great service, the food is delicious.  Their shrimp soft tacos are very good.  Family friendly too!"}
{"input": "Beautiful clean shop with knock your socks off Everything ...\nHomemade breakfast tarts and chicken pot pies .\nAll sweets looked well beyond beautiful and delish.\nI felt some of the items were a tad pricey considering the sizes being on a smaller size. But I know premium quality costs more .. \nIt's a great place for locals and worth a trip if traveling from center city etc .\nI found counter staff to be most friendly and engaging \nWill be back and certainly will recommend"}
{"input": "I love going into this place to just browse and see what trendy item I can blow my money on. Living near mass ave shopping can be limited but also very competitive. Between silver in the city, boomerang boutique, global gifts, and homespun you pretty much can find whatever you are looking for as far as gifts go. \n\nSilver in the city is always my go to first. They are always on top of the newest \"it\" items for your home and style. They also allow dogs in their store so that's a huge plus because I'm typically walking my dog when I stop in. \n\nThe only reason I am not giving them five stars is that although their employees are super friendly, they definitely watch you. I understand the need for this because they have little items that probably get stolen a lot but I always feel like I have no privacy to browse and debate any purchases. \n\nCheers!"}
{"input": "AMAZING!! We drove 2.5hrs just to try this place. It was DELICIOUS with courteous fast service. Will definitely visit again. Loved the cheese grits, omelet and sweet potato pancakes. My husband couldn't say e ought about those!"}
{"input": "Hungry hungry! Still hungry!\n\nVery cute and nice to get a table immediately after giving up on monks hour+ wait. The only redeeming attribute for an otherwise forgettable meal. \n\nBorsch was thin, perogis had very little filling and tasted more like fried dough, and wrapped cabbage was tasty but meagher. \n\n\nGo to Warsaw if you're on a diet!"}
{"input": "I travel a lot, and love Indian food, so I end up trying lots of Indian restaurants.  This was an \"out of the way\" spot which was near where I was staying, so I thought I'd take a chance.  I was not disappointed.  I had the Murg Vindaloo, and it was absolutely superb.  I asked it for a bit spicy, and they handled it perfectly.  I paired it with a special Biryani which had chicken and goat, and was excellent.\n\nService was  a bit slow to start, but was fine once we got started.   My business partner (also a fan of Indian food) and I agreed that this was now our top Indian restaurant."}
{"input": "Def. The best chinesse food in tucson, great service,food is delicious & cheap."}
{"input": "I have been in a couple of times. I would skip their Pad Thai, I like it a particular way and either you got it or you don't.  What I do like is a lot of other items, like the Sweet Basil Salmon or the NomNom salad. I have also seen plenty of other dishes float by that I am willing to try.\n\nThere expansion seems to have paid off  and its now much more comfortable to sit and stay a bit."}
{"input": "This hotel has wonderful views of the airport, and it has the only revolving rooftop restaurant.  It's connected to the airport that has several restaurants and shops.  From the revolving rooftop restaurant, I could see the runways, and the control tower."}
{"input": "Stayed here two nights for a conference. The rooms were very clean, comfortable, and fairly modern looking. Convenient location, definitely safe. All staff was very friendly. Lobby is busy, but nice place to sit"}
{"input": "Darin and Sierra were fantastic to work with. They were very flexible when some plans & routes needed to change, even less than a week before the actual event. The driver was warm & so courteous, and helped a few of our older guests beautifully. All of our guests were charmed by the schoolbus, and enjoyed the partylights on the way home. Many also loved that the sign on the side was changed from \"Jessica & Shannon are getting hitched\" on the way up, to \"Jessica & Shannon are hitched!\" after the ceremony. I loved working with JOTSB and would highly recommend them."}
{"input": "The worst Chicken Parm. Sandwich I've ever eaten. The chicken was dry and flavorless...I have a feeling it was not made that day. They put a ton of red sauce over it (no garlic, very little seasoning ), and small piece of cheese that was barely melted. \nI took a few bites because I was hungry and threw the rest out, glad I only got the 6 inch. Would never go back there....blech !!!"}
{"input": "1) carpet is sticky 2) didn't give us enough towels 3) phone doesn't work to call down to front desk 4) we asked them to clean our room five times, never happened 5) asked for sheets and blankets for the pull-out bed at least eight times, never happened. Don't waste your money here."}
{"input": "You must go here for breakfast!!! Short line and we arrived at 8:30. When we left at 9:45 the line was around the building. Santa Fe and Peach pancakes were amazing!!!!!!"}
{"input": "I love this shoppe. I have been here a few times, but I have been coming more regularly. The staff is AWESOME and the atmosphere GREAT. THey have healthy tasty treats which is nice and a host of croissants and other tasty treats. They also have food for lunch and breakfast. I havent had anything here that wasnt fantabulous."}
{"input": "I have heard about this place from a few different people, finally made it in and it lived up to the hype. Ate here with a friend, realized she had lost her wallet as soon as we sat down. Valet was super polite, brought the car up for us to check it, it wasn't there. Ended up having to run home (found it in the drive way) and came right back. The host and server were very patient and polite about it. Food was awesome, we got multiple apps to share. Servers name was Kath, she was great! From the hosts to the food and service, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"input": "When I actually lived in Philly, I never ate at Marathon Grill. I must have been smarter back then. Or maybe it was just because I had my own kitchen. \n\nAs an out-of-town visitor, I've tried it twice (10th and Walnut and the Chestnut St location), both times on a weekday morning on my way out of town. Both times the food hasn't lived up to the menu and has left me with regrets. On the most recent visit, which, I swear, will be the last, my croque monsieur was cold and my coffee sat empty. \n\nBut in both cases, I have to admit, the restaurant provided a nice, nearby, Center City brunchy-breakfast destination that got me on my way in good time. But convenience isn't all that yummy."}

{"input": "We love the Alexander and have stayed here 2 times in the last few months.  It's a very hip and comfortable hotel with great facilities and a nice staff."}
{"input": "Had breakfast here. The food was really tasty. We had the omelette and a side of grits. The only problem was that when we went to the restroom we saw into the kitchen. It looked absolutely filthy. As for the restroom itself- it was also disgusting. Had I have seen this before I had eaten, I may not have. It's now 24 hrs later and we didn't get sick, but they really need to clean up a bit back there."}
{"input": "So our most recent visit earlier this month was very disappointing, however we received an email from the company's guest service, followed by a call from the Hermitage O'Charley's manager Chris who was very professional and apologetic about our experience and asked that we give his location another try on them. So I convinced my husband to do so. Here's how this 2nd chance went:: Absolutely wonderful. Chris asked that we let him know when we wanted to give the restaurant a second chance, but we decided not to. We didn't want any special attention. We wanted real unreviewed service.  We were seated in the bar because it was a very  busy night, regardless of that the server was very attentive and had a great personality. Our food came out in a timely manner, well prepared and delicious. We have since then been back several times and service continues to remain great."}
{"input": "I think its funny that my car needed a jump infront of their shop on broad street and i was told No because of not being able to leave the store. When asked if another employee could help he said no he is about to leave. I then asked if he can give me a jump when he leaves and i also got a NO. Funny how theycservice cars, help people with cars but cant even give me a jump. Lame service. Not customer oriented at all. Typical fat guy behind the counter surfing the web and playin on his phone. The worst"}
{"input": "I have had James do all my appliance repairs since I remodeled the kitchen in 2009. He was originally recommended by the retailer where purchased my appliances and he has never disappointed me. I have had some issues with my washer and dryer, he always solves the problem while being  pleasant and professional. He arrives on time cleans up after the work is finished. He is fair in his pricing and I have always enjoyed his courteous and helpful suggestions regarding the equipment. This week my Microwave died on Monday and he was by and it was fixed on Tuesday!\nThanks James!!"}
{"input": "although i live a stones throw away and love the concept, i can no longer support this establishment. the food is just too inconsistent and despite the reasonable prices, subpar quality. i guess its still better than Goldies but Sylvan Park deserves better."}
{"input": "This is my second bad experience in a row at Stefano's. Tonight, I waited over 45 minutes for a call-in order they said would take 15 minutes. Then they were out of Greek dressing and told me they'd \"been out for a while\" - how does a Greek Italian restaurant run out of Greek dressing?"}
{"input": "This ended up being our favorite restaurant during the trip. We had dinner her twice since it was so good. The wait staff was friendly and accommodating. The food was fresh, hot and seasoned well. The veggies were amazing and could have been a meal themselves. A great experience and will definitely come back."}
{"input": "This is one of my favorite local spots to visit.  Whenever I want to get out for a bit, grab a bite to eat or get some wings and a beer on football Sunday.  Oh, by the way, wings are half price on football Sundays which makes it even better.  There are drink and food specials daily.  The food is always good and you get it quickly.  Everything I have ever had has been really good, especially their grilled reuben.  When the weather is nice, you can go out on the patio which is nice because I'm an occasional smoker.  There's a bar out there and they even have a huge tv they roll out.  When it starts to get chilly, they fire up the portable propane heaters.  They are very accommodating and the staff and manager are all very nice.  Yea, I'm going back."}
{"input": "The tour is nice however the guide did not talk much. When he did, it was not loud enough. The price for this tour is just too much."}
{"input": "This location has made me late for work twice taking 35 minutes in the drive through. Gets simple orders wrong. For a chick fil a they deserve 0 stars"}
{"input": "I have been driving passed Fellini's on West Chester Pike for some time now. Today I decided that it was time to stop by and have lunch here. The lunch prices are great, most meals average around $10. They offer a good selection of choices for lunch... pasta dishes, antipasto, salads, pizzas, paninis etc. I opted for a Panini- the \"El Patrizio\". Which consisted of grilled chicken, portobello mushrooms, spinach and provolone. When I think of a panini, I picture a sandwich all melted together with grill marks on the sides of the bread. This was more of just a normal sandwich on nice thick bread. It also came with lettuce, tomato and onions on it, which I was not aware came with the panini. The sandwich tasted good, just not what I had expected. It came with a side salad (great honey mustard dressing) and homemade chips (favorite part of my meal).  I left full and satisfied. I felt that I definitely got my moneys worth out of this meal. I would return!"}
{"input": "Ok.  So the first time I came here it was on a Sunday, the restaurant was not busy and received good food/service.  The last couple times, had the good fortune to meet the other half of the staff that take 15 mins to take your order, are rude when you ask where the food is (had a waitress nicely blurt out, \"It's coming!\") or just forget about you.  The food is good enough and their variety is well worth checking out.  The K&B sandwich is delicious.  Went in there recently and they were short staffed again with much of the same results....getting lost in the shuffle with the other tables (even though we had arrived first) and all around slow service.  And for god's sake don't ask to split a check!  \n\nHats off to the chef for dealing with a WAY understaffed day at the restaurant, though."}
{"input": "The Whitman Roast Beef is a solid sandwich bc it includes fried oysters tenderloin tips, and cheese. This seems like a good spot to grab a drink. Interesting decorations with old typewriters, a cozy fireplace, friendly bartenders and it's much cleaner than neighboring spots. Check it out!"}
{"input": "They seriously served us sushi on PRINGLES!  I am not even lying.  I forget what appetizer this was we ordered BUT IT CAME OUT ON PRINGLES!  There's inventive and there's cheesey.  Everytime I think about that, I think about Kitchen Nitemares with Gordon Ramsey and what the hell he'd have to say if he was served that. \n\nThat said, the rest of the food was ok--I may go back for the All you can eat sushi, which they started after the Pringles incident, but being served Sushi on Pringles seriously lost this place a star.\n\nPRINGLES!"}
{"input": "Went there tonight courtesy of a Groupon purchase and was pleasantly surprised at the array of dishes. Decided to go with the Fried Pork Chop sandwich which very good. My girlfriend had the crab cakes with mac & cheese and mashed potatoes. Everything was delicious and we'll be definitely making a return trip b"}
{"input": "I wanted to like Izumi but didn't. The host/waiter certainly was accommodating so service was not the issue. For the price I found the portion size to be very small.  When paying $13 for a roll I expect it to be much more hearty in size than an appetizer type roll that is more like a side dish than an entree.  The sea weed salad was nasty - although I felt like the waiter prepared us for the - others must have complained. The ginger chicken took a long time to cook but I am not sure why as when it came out it was still pink.  The flavor was ok but for $21 I would have expected to get more than an appetizer size portion of chicken. It was accompanied by a risotto which was flavored as salt. The saltiness was so overpowering that you couldn't taste anything else.  As someone who lived in Japan for four years and studied the language and culture for eleven I was underwhelmed by izumi."}
{"input": "They accept digital coupons!!! I love that everyone is always super helpful in person and on the phone. I was having trouble finding a few items for my project at home and was in need of pure Beeswax and i could not find it anywhere in Tucson and Michael's had it. Not only that but i had a 40% off coupon and was going to do 2 separate transactions to use the 40% off my most expensive item and they will automatically do this! AMAZING! I love this store and could definitely get lost in it - there are so many different craft ideas and items you wouldn't think of for gift ideas. The store is very clean and organized and staff is friendly and helpful. They also offer craft classes- definitely gonna look into that!"}
{"input": "Owned by Peppermill and decorated with lots of neon glitz, the Coffee Shop and the Deli both have the same food as the Peppermill in Reno but at half the cost.  Join the \"Birthday Club\" in the casino.  They give you a $10 food credit to join and send you $25 food credit for you birthday.  NO SLOT CLUB CARD.  Just sign up for the Birthday Club.  First meal there was the BEST Pot Roast I've ever had and since I had joined the Club, it ended up being FREE.  The Deli serves excellent Corned Beef and Pastrami piled high like at the Peppermill, but instead of $14.95 the EXACT same sandwich is $5.95 at Western Village.   A GREAT FIND.  In Sparks just off I80 behind Sierra Sid's.  Take McCarran exit off I80 and go NORTH one block and make a right."}

{"input": "What an amazing place!! Down here for work and decided to stroll around. This place popped on yelp and didn't disappoint... DELICIOUS food! \n\nHad the Crispy Hip City Ranch. I'm not a vegan/vegetarian at all and I thought this was better than any real chicken sandwich I'd usually get. Service was great... Staff extremely friendly. Also had the green lemonade.. Again, delicious. \n\nI'll be coming here every time I'm down from NYC for work. Wish we had one of these up there"}
{"input": "Feeling compelled to write this review laying in bed, dreaming about the Pro Tap Burger - what every other burger out there wants to be when it grows up. I don't love this burger just because it's literally a block away from me - I would walk 500 miles to fall down at Pro Taps door for this burger. I am also a HUGE fan of brioche buns. Fries are covered in a garlicky herb situation unlike any you've had before. Do yourself a favor and skip your kids recital, blow off that friend you've been playing phone tag with for weeks... but don't bring your friend who's all like \"are these gluten free vegan fries?\"... get some of their seriously awesome beers, a burger, maybe start off w some of their mac and cheese? I'm just sayin....."}

{"input": "I have been wanting to come here since I seen the reviews on Yelp. Well on yesterday , I decided to go after church. I am so so so glad I got a chance to go. This place exceeded my expectations. I think I ordered almost everything on the menu, lol. \nThe donuts were so fluffy and delicious.\nThe sliders are absolutely amazing. \nPlease don't get me started on the cheese fries, awesome. \nI never heard of candied jalapeños til now & they were heavenly. \nI wish they weren't out of cinnamon rolls because I really wanted to try them. \nThe place stayed rolling in with people / I thought they would've been less packed on a Sunday afternoon but they were not. \nLove love love this place and I can't wait to get back ASAP."}
{"input": "The Cuban was one of the best I have had. Save room for their soft serve ice cream-very creamy. \nYou can order a picnic lunch and enjoy it in the park across the street."}
{"input": "It's was okay service was a bit on the interesting side as the person was new. Food presentation was good though they need to either add rice or more potato salad to the gumbo. Sprite was flat but I didn't need it anyways."}
{"input": "A neighborhood cafe with GREAT soul food. We went for the lunch buffet and it did not disappoint. The fried chicken was crispy and well seasoned, the white beans had chunks of ham and sausage that put it over the top (in a good way!), the greens were very hammy and tasty...and I didn't even have room to try it all. The bread pudding was tempting but I was done at that point. Very friendly service!"}
{"input": "I'm pretty mixed on this place. Service was great. Super happy and friendly. Price was right... a buck a donut (or less if you order a bunch) is just right.  Selection was excellent, and a lot of donuts were kept in a warming oven so that it would be served warm.\n\nAll that was great... but I didn't think the donut was anything special.  I got a cinnasquare... and it was just a really sugary donut.  Not so much cinnamon. Square doesn't affect the taste, sorry to say.\n\nI can't speak to the other donuts, and there seemed to be a lot of regular customers slamming this place... so perhaps I should have gone with the PBJ that got many positive comments on the spot.  Compared to Dunkin' I'd come to this place... but any other local donut place.... this is just ok."}
{"input": "Went for breakfast on Sunday morning around 10am; there was 4 of us. Wait was only 5 minutes, which was nice. Food was pretty good - I got the house omelette with homemade salsa, my side of bacon never came along with our waitress. She took our order and we did not see her again until we were done and waited for boxes for the kids food. Never got my coffee refilled because of that or any napkins. Service could have definitely been better - they're lucky the food was doable."}
{"input": "I dig these guys. Very friendly help. Leased skis for the fam last 2 years And did a heat mold of my ski boot liners there (they have a heat blower machine, my liners don't like the oven). I think the guy who did my heat mold could have done a bit more detailed job but I'll go back the next time I need a mold. I don't purchase my kayak equipment there but know they have a good selection."}
{"input": "The lady at the front desk was amazing, we got in at 3am and she found us a room. The problem I have is we were trying to get into our room when somebody walked out and said they worked there and said that's where he takes his breaks because \"nobody ever books this room.\" This was very weird and uncomfortable, and then when we walked in the room smelled awful."}
{"input": "The restaurant was very nicely decorated , and clean. There were six of us and everyone enjoyed their meals . I had the fried green tomatoes. They were perfectly seasoned and the sauce served with them was delicious. The down side is they arrived after everyone else had their meals . My friends had the chicken salad , the fried bologna sandwich and a cheeseburger. We shared the peach cobbler dessert and were not disappointed, get it with the ice cream !!"}
{"input": "Outstanding customer service! And my car is driving great now! Brian and the other guys walked me through the work I needed on my car, and I never once felt taken advantage of or blindsided. I ended up needing four new tires and a new hub cap, talk about bad news! But they were extremely professional, personable, and treated me like a human being. I've experienced auto shops that treat me like an idiot, that do a poor job fixing my car, or that tell me I need extra work done (for a fee, of course). It turns out I did need \"extra\" work, but Brian showed me the damage, explained the process, and showed a lot of compassion. And now my car is remarkably better. I will definitely be back in the future, and I would recommend Tires Plus in Flourtown to anyone."}
{"input": "I love the Brewpub for their variety of dishes.  Nachos, pizza and sandwiches.  Variety of beers to choose from crafted right on sight.  \n\nEvery time we go, the service is slow.  I think it's just the pace of the restaurant.  It's never a quick beer and a bite of food.  Instead, enjoy the patio and friends, savor that time.  \n\nKid and dog friendly environment.  Also great for your vegetarian and vegan friends.  \n\nMy go to is a half order of the nachos or fish & chips.  \n\nTried their Pumpkin Seasonal Beer and it's on par with some of my favorite pumpkins."}
{"input": "Wife and I tried this joint for the first time on a Sat eve take out,as it's 5 min from our home.We are always trying new places and love that we had a new option for bbq close by.Start with the ribs, which were unfortunately short ribs,disappointing,just ok I would prefer regular pork,baby backs or beef as they have more flavor.No real smoke taste,fell right off bone..this should not be,I like a little resistance.They added some bbq suace which didn't help,it wasn't that good,I prefer dry rubbed bbq on side.\n\nChile was real good,kale slaw was diff and ok,the dressing was too thick and just too much of it.Pulled chicken tacos were very good,Mac n cheese was ok.Corn bread was probably stale,I hope it was, because it was very dry,taste was ok but man it was dry.May or may not return to try some of the other options and beer,they should probably define the rib selection and I should have asked.Owners were very nice as well, food was ready in less than 10min,decor was very nice. Good Luck to Them.JK"}
{"input": "Probably in my top 2 favorite places in Brandon... Food is quality, crisp, and super fresh. Great blend of flavors in everything on the menu. I went for a time where I had to have the pad-thai at least once a week. Never really that busy (but they should be). Staff is super friendly and attentive, Price is low if you are looking at the over all picture and compare it to the worth. THIS PLACE IS SUPER CLEAN!!!! Which in my opinion is a good way to judge a quality restaurant.... and this place is spotless. Not kidding at all on this,,, you could literally eat off the floors in the bathroom. Spotless.\n\nIf you live any where in the Tampa/Brandon area, do yourself a favor and check this place out... I want them to do well because I want to be able to eat there next time I am in town!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"input": "Decent frozen yogurt with a lot of options for toppings. They have about 8 different froyo flavors to chose from. Lots of possible combinations. However, it can get expensive pretty quickly when you weigh the cup. \n\nThere's not a lot of seating inside. Staff is friendly but not very active. I do want to try their bubble tea, but j wasn't very impressed."}
{"input": "Best Thai food in Indy! The Larb Chicken Salad is the best I've had ever; and I have had the opportunity to partake of Thai food all over the country. Only wished they were still open for lunch on Saturdays. The brother-sister team are warm and welcoming. They treat you like neighbors."}
{"input": "Highly recommend this tour. We had a great experience and didn't have to spend a boat load of money to have a good time. The tour guides were informational and we really enjoyed the beer samples along the way (probably a little too much). If you're just arriving in St. Louis and are looking for fun and inexpensive experiences, this is the place to go."}
{"input": "Great service, Daniel was very personable and attentive. Food was okay, nothing bad but nothing stood out either. Probably won't go back as there really was nothing memorable about the food."}
{"input": "Extremely friendly with great service. Extra large interior for a waffle house with padded backs in the booths. Will happily return."}
{"input": "I have eaten at other Joes Crab Shacks and they were much better. I had an apple crisp dessert first. It was ok. Main dish was a pasta of shrimp and sausage. Also...just ok. Shrimp were very small and the sausage was ok. The sauce was pretty good however. I ate at the bar and had good service. I probably would not go back."}
{"input": "The best! Dr Kupcha is outstanding and great front office staff. Their plan was spot on and their execution was professional throughout."}
{"input": "Several people recommended this place to us so we have it a try with a takeout pizza. It was delicious! A little thicker than traditional NY style but not \"doughy\". A few weeks later we discovered we were in the delivery area and again got a pizza and also tried the Stromboli. Everything arrived hot within the promised time frame. Stromboli was loaded with cheese and toppings. Definitely our go to pizza place!"}
{"input": "Rosa Mezcal was a fantastic experience.The service was excellent.Celina was very helpful and excited to teach us about the food and the cuisine.Although the chefs likely do not have the culinary pedigree of some New Orleans restaurants, the food, although not perfect, is unique and thoughtfully creative.The atmosphere is fun and has some really nice and unique design elements.Overall, it was a great experience, and you just want them to succeed and become a small business success story.Celina was absolutely incredible.Looking forward to trying the drink menu when they get their liquor license."}
{"input": "Took forever to deliver and I am just blocks away. They claim one driver had ten orders to deliver, ridiculous! After the almost two hour wait, WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!! Just the weirdest shrimp scampi I have ever had. They tried to do too much with it. The only good thing was the sweet potato cheesecake. I would give the cheesecake five stars and that's the only thing I would ever get from here again!"}
{"input": "This place is AMAZING. Short and sweet. Just go check it out PLEASE. You won't regret it. I went for a pedicure and from my kneecaps down I feel like a NEW and IMPROVED PERSON. Great people as well."}
{"input": "I love restaurants that you underestimate. If dining at a restaurant four times in one week isn't enough of an endorsement, El Limon uses the freshest ingredients but more importantly it's the spices. Plus, the little market next door has the spices for sale at almost free prices! You must dine here ASAP!"}
{"input": "We came here based on the recommendation we received and from the street it doesn't look like much. But when you sit down and you scan the menu you will come to realize that this place serves nothing but home-cooked comfort food. We had the BLT and it was packed full of flavor, they didn't scrimp on the bacon and the vegetables for very fresh. With the sandwiches came some of the best french fries that we've had, and some of the best coleslaw that I've had in the state of Florida. We took a couple of pies home and they were delicious. We will definitely come back."}
{"input": "Mediocre food but great location and friendly service. Looks more legit than it actually was, maybe on par with Sonnys."}
{"input": "Harry and Izzy's is classy and delightful. I am really taken by the Art Deco/1920s style. If you are in the mood for a stellar cocktail with a sophisticated atmosphere this is your best bet.  The bar has an awesome view of Georgia which makes for great people watching. The outdoor seating is also a major plus. And talk about good food. You get what you pay for. Very high quality service combined with perfectly prepared gourmet food.  I have never had a bad experience, I just wish I could afford to eat here more often."}
{"input": "I went there for a work lunch and it was amazing. I recommend the chicken tacos, because they were delicious. Everyone else at my table loved the food as well and they all ordered different things. Will definitely return."}
{"input": "Came here for the great vegetarian options, but left very dissatisfied. Burrito was unseasoned, nothing inside only rice, and black beans. I wouldn't come here again.  Definitely not real Mexican, and customer service was horrible."}
{"input": "This place is amazing!!! There aren't enough words for how amazing the food is here. The BBQ shrimp are a must and if you're into truffle oil/butter flavors I highly recommend the truffle fries (more than enough to share) and the truffle butter filet mignon. For dessert the bread pudding and white chocolate brownie are both good options!"}
{"input": "If I could give this place 6 stars, I would.  Food is consistent, simple, and good.  People who are complaining about the cramped space and pissy waitresses need to relax- this is what a good BYO in a little homey neighborhood in a big city is like.  If you want room, go to Applebee's and request a booth.  Won't miss ya.\n\nMy husband and I always get the same thing- 1/2 and 1/2 (a combo plate with half hummus and half baba), sauteed mussels, smelts, shrimp scampi, and grilled octopus.  If we have room, the rice pudding is great.\n\nFYI- plan in plenty of time to find parking, BYO, and cash only."}
{"input": "Highly recommend! Great selection, superb service and incredible prices. The owner does not try to force certain brands, straightforward and knowledgeable. My daughter needed a new pair for track and we were in and out in less than 10 min. He made sure the fit was good and that SHE picked what she liked."}
{"input": "Freaky fast is a joke here.  It regularly takes over a hour to receive a lunch delivery from this location.  After three instances of this I am done.  I will not order from this location again."}
{"input": "I had Cucina Zapata for the first time last week and it did not disappoint! I ended up getting the Cap'n Crunch tilapia burrito and it was delicious. It was a huge burrito, stuffed to the max, and only $6!! My co-workers say cucina zapata is one of, if not the best food trucks you can find by Drexel's campus, and they're not wrong. However, because of their popularity, expect to wait a few minutes for your order- the wait wasn't too bad, but just be aware there might be a line to order as well as a line to pick up."}
{"input": "so glad we stopped by. The soft serve ice cream with vanilla cake was delicious, the kids loved it. I'm giving them a 5 stars because the staff were super friendly! definitely stopping by the next time we visit Reno again"}
{"input": "\"The best reception I have ever attended\"\n\"OMG the food was great\"\n\"We had soooo much fun!\"\n\"Beautiful venue!\" \n\nThese were just a few of the comments from our wedding reception on March 14, 2015. We had approximately 90 guests. Everything was PERFECT!!! Carol and her staff are consummate professionals in every way. I highly recommend this gorgeous venue."}
{"input": "As usual, this restaurant doesn't seem to heed the bad reviews and fix the problems. Dinner here last night was abysmal. The prime rib was 40% fat with tons of gristle. My dog wouldn't even eat the left overs!  Who wants cold fries? I asked for regular butter (not cinnamon) and never got it. Hey, Jeanne, do you not even TRY to fix your problems?"}
{"input": "Jen was a dream to work with! Our order was simple - a bouquet for myself and boutonniere for my husband - but she always made our floral feel so special and important. I sent her a few inspiration photos and a color palette and her vision was more than I could have ever dreamed! I might have hugged her 10 times when she delivered and couldn't bring myself to get rid of the bouquet after the night was over it was so beautiful. Thank you, Jen, for bringing so much beauty to our big day!"}
{"input": "The food was pretty good, although our appetizer came out about 1 minute before our food did, which was a little frustrating. The guacamole was very good, however my chicken tacos could have been better. \n\nService was okay, not bad, but definitely not great. It seems like the whole staff is very young and may not have as much restaurant experience. However, the GM was very attentive and definitely treated all the guests with respect."}
{"input": "My friend and I travel to St. Louis for a concert at Delmar Hall. This restaurant was right across from the venue and a perfect place to grab a bite before getting in line for the show. \n\nOur waitress was incredibly nice and was very quick to check on us and take our order.\n\nWe shared a 12\" thin crust with bacon and ricotta and it may have been one of the best pizzas we both have had. \n\nOnly weird thing was the fact that their was absolutely no lighting in the bathroom. This only mattered a wee bit because my friend and I tried to reaply a little bit of make up before heading to the concert. But it worked out and we were fine. \n\nOverall, would come here again, next time I'm in St. Louis."}
{"input": "I stopped in for a drink yesterday and have to say the atmosphere gets an A+ from me.  Such a unique concept for the St. Pete area.  The attention to detail with the remodel was outstanding, it almost feels like you are in a Harry Potter movie or something.  There is background music that is set at a low volume so you can clearly hear your friends or not have to shout for them to hear you - perfect for the old library-esque environment. Working behind the bar were Michael and Peggy - both couldn't have been more friendly and were overall just interesting people to talk to.   I had eaten dinner already before I came so can't speak on the food but will definitely be back to try - the prices for meat/cheese trays are much better than comparable places in the area.  I would definitely recommend checking this place out..."}
{"input": "Dave was very nice and explained the menu, the dogs were whipped up fast and were delicious, hit the spot. Dave's special, pizza dog and a custom creation were all excellent and he threw in some grilled jalapeños too. Santa Barbara desperately needs more late night food carts like this."}
{"input": "A cultural institution since the early 1970's, bringing local famous artists to the visitors, but not just that, they have rotating exhibits that are always very good.  Housed in an old mill that has a modern addition, designed and built back in the mid-29th century, that stands today as fresh as when it was built, surrounded by nature, as it is on the banks of the Brandywine river.\n\nPlan to spend the afternoon, they have a great little restaurant there as well.  Take a walk along the Brandywine.  It is just off of Rte 1, west of the 202 interchange, just west of the town of Chadd's Ford."}
{"input": "Cute hotel stayed here for my wife and I's one year anniversary.  Positives would be the cleanliness of the room, the comfy kin size bed, bright, colorful room, close to the beach with a nice private area.  Negatives would be the closed front office hours, small parking lot for hotel (have to park across street if full...not that big of a deal though), and not the friendliest front office staff.  I would definitely stay here again!"}
{"input": "Cleanest bathroom in the quarter, felt like a laboratory. Best bloody Mary's ever. You got to love pickled green beans in a bloody."}
{"input": "Would have been a 5.   Food was excellent. Ambiance is well-designed.  Hostess fit the cool vibe.  Bartender seemed a bit bothered but drinks were nicely crafted (when I was finally noticed).  Great care went into making  the cocktail but it floored me that the ice  was the kind  you get at the machine in 7-11.  Kudos to the chef though; Cant get this authenticity in NY...and the value is incomparable."}
{"input": "Have to say this hipster hangout surprised me. Love the decor. Easy and comfy. The menu is good. I got the special, chicken and toast. The blueberry topping was kinda bland, needed to be sweeter. The chicken had a nice surprising heat. The waiter, Joel, was good. Very knowledgable, well spoken, knew his menu. I love all the cocktails. The coffee comes hot or iced. Which is nice in Arizona. I love that they bring a big container of water to the table. Same with the creamer. They aren't cheap. Love that they are dog friendly.   Very nice brunch. Will be back and will bring people!!!"}
{"input": "We ordered take out from here the other night.  We were pretty excited about take out sushi in the area so we gave it a shot.  The menu wasn't that impressive, kind of a boring selection, but we ordered a few rolls and the staff was friendly and the delivery prompt.  The rolls themselves weren't anything exciting, but were tasty enough.  We'll probably order from here again when we're too lazy to go out and get sushi."}
{"input": "Great food and friendly service. I will definitely be back. Menu variety is great.  I had the Monte Cristo crepes, absolutely amazing"}
{"input": "Went in for the soft opening and we walked away very impressed.  Try the koreancini and the wings - both stand to be this place's signature dishes.  The sake punch was a fun take on sangria.  Fair beer menu and plenty of spirits to choose from.  Dessert was their play on strawberry shortcake that satisfied.  We'll be here often."}
{"input": "I'm not sure why this hospital has not such a good rep. I love this hospital the people are nice.  I never have too long of a wait like other hospitals.  & the parking lot is a 5star all in itself because its so close to the hospital.  I've had my gallbladder removed from this hospital.  I was well taken care of"}
{"input": "food was ok but it took them 30 mins to plate our food. then they gave us a lame excuse of needing to redo one plate. mean while 3 tables after us where served the same dish. where i come from that ain't right. The only reason they received 2 stars is after mentioning the time it took, they gave us a discount, the reality is the food is just so so. plenty of other places around with better food."}
{"input": "PDQ is Great!!!\n\nPDQ has delicious chicken fingers and the hand cut fries are awesome. The food is very flavorful and you can really taste the quality of the food. I have also tried the Buffalo Tender sandwich, grilled chicken and grilled turkey sandwiches.... All of them are delicious!!!"}
{"input": "Awesome local brew pub with funny beer names, cool staff, decent bar food, indoor/outdoor seating options, TV screens, and flights. \n\nYou can get a tour of the facility, buy Danny Boy swag, and beer to-go!"}
{"input": "This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at.  Clean, polite staff, nice pool and grand entrance.   I can't wait until next year to come back."}
{"input": "My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to meet a friend in south street and tried Paddy Whacks. The bar is very roomy and had a nice atmosphere.  As I ordered beers I read reviews that the beer is overpriced but I disagree. I thought the beers were reasonably priced (coronas $5). We ordered appetizers to pick at (get the cheesesteak eggrolls). \nWe came on a Monday night and played their quizzo and won $15 off our bill! The bartender and waitress were super nice. Overall had a great time and would check this spot out again."}
{"input": "The local vibe, fresh shucked oysters at the bar, friendly service, and delicious seafood, (fresh local), make this place worth checking out."}
{"input": "Great food and good coffee. Wish they had more of an espresso bar with coffee options, but food and baked goods are spectacular!"}
{"input": "I would not bother spending money on the drinks here. They lack the necessary selection for a coffee house. Even their signature drink is overly and needlessly sweet and lacks any real flavor. I can't speak for their food but from what I saw, is overpriced."}
{"input": "This is my new favorite dining spot in New Orleans. We heard about the place from a cab driver and thought we'd give it a try. We we not disappointed. I ordered BBQ ribs which were the best I've ever had. My wife and son had the stuffed peppers which were excellent. That coming from an Italian means so much as we're reluctant to go Italian since few places cook like mama does. My daughter had the seafood platter which served at least 2 people and was some of the best seafood to date. Here's the best part. Our server, Roland, was the most personable, articulate, and genuinely service-oriented waiter we've ever met. I can say without reservation, Roland made the evening memorable and left us wanting to come back. Praline Connection is a 5 star restaurant, hidden gem, found only a short distance from the French Quarters. Please ask for Roland and enjoy your dining experience in a most casual way."}
{"input": "This bakery / pastry shop is located in the Reading market. I stopped by for breakfast and purchased 2 items, Carrot cake and Tiramisu. Match this with a cafe from Old City coffee and you are in for a treat these two left me full and ready for the day. Thankfully it's was a very active day and it helped me avoid the sugar crash. This was also because these items were not over sweet and rich in flavour. I can not enjoy something that is too sweet and lacking in flavour. I will return to try the lemonciello pecan diamonds and pasticcios. \nCheck this place out in the Reading market you'll like it."}
{"input": "Only came here once and that was because I saw their sign of drink specials. Ended up getting a few jello shots and 1 margarita for really cheap. Drinks were decent. Sat outside at the bar. Probably will return."}
{"input": "I feel strange knocking back the star rating just because I don't always like their hot food bar, so I'm not going to. I stop here A LOT, TOOO MUCH for lunch and I've become familiar with the things that they do well and the things they don't. Even their soups can sometimes be bland and sad. I still appreciate their food though, on a busy day when you want something wholesome it's one of the only places to run in and out, well near my work anyway. I have to say their breakfast bar on Saturdays and (I think also on Sundays) pretty much blows the one at Whole Foods out of the water. In fact I would say their hot bar is just better than all the hot bars at Whole Foods combined. So take that."}
{"input": "I was visiting Tucson recently and was told to try Agustin Brasserie by a local patron I had met. First of all, the place is beautiful! Classic, stylish, clean and very welcoming. Felt comfortable upon entering. Service was top notch, my service was by a very knowledgeable woman named, Heidi. I had a hard time deciding what to order and after she questioned my taste, she recommended the salmon along with a perfectly paired white wine. I have to say, best salmon ever! I'm from Seattle, so I know salmon. The meal was fantastic and her service was stellar! I am sad I live far because I would frequent Agustin on a regular and I'd be so happy to return for her service!\n\nTHANK YOU Heidi and Agustin Brasserie! I will be back next time I am in Tucson!"}
{"input": "So I decided to give this place a shot after reading all the reviews on yelp. The place was dead but I have it a shot. The food was okay at best. I actually left there and went across the street to Charlie's. The place was packed and one bite of the redtop pizza and I cursed myself for not coming here first. If you want a sit down meal this place is nice. If you want good pizza go to Charlie's."}
{"input": "Always a great cold stone to visit! Great employees and yummy ice cream! Store is always clean and they treat you like family here."}
{"input": "This is the most beautiful salon I have ever seen. It very clean an organized with an amazing friendly staff. I was given a tour by the owner Doug he is one cool dude.\n\nDoug has an extensive resume of accomplishments as a stylist, he teaches and trains all over the world and brings his expertise and share with his salon staff by holding a weekly training in his salon to ensure his staff is up to date with the latest technique and fashions. If I would trust anybody with my hair it would be here at this place.\n\nI would recommend this place to anybody local or is from out of town."}
{"input": "The TV shows are $4.99 and they have commercials! What a cheesy way to make money and a sign of a less than classy hotel, particularly when you pay more than $150 a night.  And there is NO complimentary breakfast, just an overpriced buffet, something even the cheapest hotels in California provide."}
{"input": "I love famoso. They have a simple philosophy and it's no surprise their franchise has expanded so quickly. \n\nThe pizzas are probably one of my favorites in the city, especially the brussel sprout/prosciutto chip one. It's amazing. \n\nI can never decide whether I like having to go up and order or not but really it never takes too much time and it's not hard to do! \n\nMy favorite location is the one down in terwillegar - least favorite is probably jasper. Food is great everywhere but I like the atmosphere better in the newer ones. I've never been a high tables fan. \n\nAll in all I have never been disappointed. And they take care of their customers. Service is always great. \n\nSad the wine club had to go. :("}
{"input": "We have been here twice for brunch and have enjoyed it immensely. Everything we have tried has been delicious, particularly the grits with scallions and sour cream. But the room is always freezing so be sure to bring a sweater!"}
{"input": "I first heard about this place on the plane ride over from a Franklin local.  He recommended that we brave the line and try one of Nashvilles best breakfast spots.  HE WAS RIGHT.  Holly cow this place kicked butt and we didn't even have to wait in line!! We were lucky to miss the rush said our waitress.   I had this super savory corn pancake with bacon, salsa, and sour cream. So good. This place will always be a stop when I get back to the south~~~"}
{"input": "Great food love the atmosphere in the place. . .  the carne asada tacos are just like back home !!!"}
{"input": "First time for lunch.  Extensive and flavorful gluten free menu.  \n\nGood lunch and friendly service."}
{"input": "I'm glad this place isn't closer.\n\nSrsly, Peanut Butter & Chocolate, where did you come from?!"}
{"input": "Pricey for burgers and beer but very tasty. Get the rooster sauce for your fries, its a mayonaise flavored  sauce. Cool building and vibe with a modern industrial look. Would have given 5 stars if the beers offerings were larger for the price."}
{"input": "The park has a great playground and a cute splash pad.  There are family friendly private bathrooms next to splash pad, but unfortunately most of seating for the parents around the splash pad and playground are in the sun.  There are shady places around them, so bringing your own folding chair would be good if you plan on staying awhile.  My two year old played there for 3 hours between the splash pad and playground, and would have stayed longer if I let her.  The playground and splash pad are in the same enclosure, so water shoes would also be a good idea bc the pavement around the playground gets hot.  I do like that they are enclosed so my kid is confined that one area.  The playground does have different age sections for toddlers to older kids."}
{"input": "Each time we eat here it is delicious and the staff are so friendly.  We ordered way too much food this time and they were worried we did not like it.  It was great.  House fried rice was filled with Shrimp, beef, onions, and was very tasty. I love the . \"General's Chicken\" and of course the egg rolls.\n\nMy suggestion to those who gave this place bad reviews -   If you have a dish you don't like they would love to have you tell them.  Don't just go away and write a bad review.  They really want to please their customers."}
{"input": "Great location. Good value for the money. Clean rooms most of the staff is awesome. The regular chef in the morning is smoking great. Breakfast can't be better. The dining room in the evening not so good. Bartender has the personality of a slug. Waiter tries hard but is overwhelmed. Not my first stay here. Love a lot of aspects of this hotel. They need to focus on menu items for the evening and more and better trained staff."}
{"input": "Honestly this place is pretty good. I've gone here several times and never had a bad experience. Food is good and the workers have all been cool, the only negative I could say about the place is that it's slightly over priced, specially for being in IV. I typically go to noodle city but if I wanna go somewhere close then pho bistro is convenient and pretty good, would suggest going there if you want a quick pho fix."}
{"input": "Great place, great food, wonderful service, and you just can't beat the price!  If you are looking for authentic puertorrican food this is the place to go.  You will feel you are enjoying a meal with family and friends.  Best mofongo ever!!!!"}
{"input": "New St. Louis Wok is one of the few local Chinese places that deliver to our area.  Every time (but one), we've ordered, and gotten the food within an house.  In addition, they have a website where you can order the food (avoiding possible language barriers), and then they follow up with a call for your credit card number.\n\nFood wise, it's the best Chinese delivery we've had here.  Nothing too greasy, and everything comes hot...with lots of sauces and fortune cookies.  For our rare Chinese cravings, it's the go-to place."}
{"input": "Dreadful place. Nice products, but not worth the constant glaring and staring. The staff seem to believe that every shopper is going to suddenly run off with a rack full of clothes. I have never felt as uncomfortable in any other store. Creepy."}
{"input": "Yikes, I just got that hard nasty piece of chicken that usually ruins Chinese restaurants for you. Bad, very bad. The worst. The steak and shake next door was so busy they had to close, and I should have known since no one was in line at Wendy's. most disgusting fast food I've ever experienced, crazy that this was the absolute worst. Garbage food."}
{"input": "Food is always great. This is one of my regular weekly lunch spots. Drive thru depends on the day as to quickness it usually goes fast. Today super quick! Got the half sandwich and cup of soup. Delicious the turkey avacodo BLT , chicken and rice soup  and a sweet tea I'm set. :)"}
{"input": "This place is the bomb! Brought two of my cars here, and couldn't of been more satisfied! Rosemary is very nice and will answer any question you have very professionally. This place is very cool looking inside and out, and have very talented people performing the work. The price is also the best around and they warranty any work they do!  They don't try and sell you stuff you don't need either. These people have great reviews for a reason, and I'm happy I chose them for my window tint!! Please don't waste your time with any other window tinting business!! Rosemary and her team is the ONLY way to go!"}
{"input": "My husband took me here for our Anniversary and it was such a delight! Hats off to the chef for the amazing dinner that melted in my mouth. And the customer service was top notch. Definitely will be back!"}
{"input": "Michaels Grill is a hidden treasure.  Surprisingly, there was no customers around 11:15am so we were able to come in and sit down inside right away.\n\nThe food here is DELICIOUS.  Ordered the Monste Cristo sandwich and it came with fries.  It was the most delicious ever.  It even looked beautiful, topped with powdered sugar and a side of orange marmalade.\n\nWe also ordered the Miami Reuben, which was perfectly prepared. We spent $20 roughly and just ordered water to drink.\n\nThe whole experience at this restaurant, including the service and cleanliness is a 10 out of 10!\n\nI highly recommend you come eat here."}
{"input": "It was OK , i wont be going back, people coming up to the table passing out flyers disrespectful the waitress not remembering our order, just messy. one and done."}
{"input": "My son is living here while attending school.  Great views and clean building in the heart of IV."}
{"input": "Okay so I've spent the last year traveling between California and meridian for a long distance relationship and I'm a huge breakfast junkie. My boyfriend brought me the express cafe( which we call cafe express lol) because I LOVE eggs Benny. This place is amazing! I've had eggs Benedict at many places, it's my go to and this place doesn't disappoint. Beware they do not take reservations and the wait can be pretty long but it's sooooo worth it. I'm finally in Idaho full time and ecstatic I get to eat here every week."}
{"input": "The ricotta cheese is key!! The super picky hubby loved the BBQ Chicken Pizza and said everything was cooked to perfection, no one flavor overpowering the other. Everything was perfect. It was definitely worth the 30-minute drive (one-way) to pick it up. Ordering and paying on-line made it super convenient and the pizzas were ready when we got there."}
{"input": "The food there is good. The only thing is just like all other sushi restaurants if you go in at the busy time you Will not be noticed. Last time I was there we waited 20 mins for bar spots with kids. And finally we found a table I asked my server if we can move there she said sure. Then a minute later she disappears and another family took the place. Of course she didn't even bring the drinks we ordered after all this time. So we decide to leave. Nope, maybe get organized first then open the restaurant. I don't minding waiting but all the servers look buys but they don't do anything just hang around. No not this again."}
{"input": "I have eaten at Vecchia Osteria twice in the last few weeks, once in the restaurant and then for take out. Both experiences were very good. When dining-in the service was prompt and the owner very friendly and accommodating to a large party. The place has a very nice atmosphere with outside seating available. \n\nSome stand-out dishes were the lamb chops, gorgonzola gnocchi, and the desserts were great - amazing cannolis, tiramisu, and a lemon cake. It is a bit pricey, but fair in comparison to other local italian restaurants."}
{"input": "so, my husband and i had a GC here... and we were pleasantly surprised about the whole evening... they let us bring our dog, and opened the back patio for us.... when we arrived there was a lone table with a white table cloth and candle gleaming... it was like we had our own private dinner with waiter service. the lettuce wraps were divine. my husband enjoyed his wine. and it was truly special and unique. Our only qualm is the quality of the dessert menu. we couldn't find anything on there we wanted.  wah.  otherwise. it was great."}
{"input": "After experiencing other sushi destinations, I found that Mixx cant compete. First off, the all you can eat deal is nothing more than just rice. You might as well go make some rice at home or order some at local Chinese takeout. They use ridiculous amounts of rice for the typical sushi and rolls. At times, they drown the specialty rolls in sauce too. \n\nThe only bright spots in this place are: byob and dragon roll. I did enjoy the dragon roll from here but thats about it."}
{"input": "Our new favorite pizza place in Reno. The food was great, the service was fast, and the employees were super nice!!"}
{"input": "This place was exactly as advertised.  Showed up at about noon on a Saturday, the place was busy but we were able to grab the last two seats at the bar.  Village burger was incredible, so was all the whiskey we tried.  Highly recommend the Manhattan, one of the best I've had anywhere."}
{"input": "Awesome place!   I wish I had one closer to where I live. Homemade Italian breads and desserts in all different shapes and sizes.   Great subs and pizza Great place a must stop"}
{"input": "I want to know what happened to this place. A year ago I would have given it 5 stars but now I can't. The biggest difference is their chicken breasts. I bought 5 breasts last week to feed the family and there was virtually no meat on them. It's almost as if they cut the center out and there's only a little meat on both edges and a whole lot of breaded bone. It was ridiculous! Of course like an idiot I thought it was a fluke and bought another breast this week. Same thing. The other pieces are the usual size and quite tasty. I don't know what's going on but I would advise you not to buy the breasts even if you're a fan of white meat. They're the most expensive piece of chicken and not worth it at all. Otherwise the service is ok and when you call ahead it's ready for pickup about 75% of the time."}
{"input": "Wow has this place turned around. I've been going in weekly for quick print jobs. The staff is on top of it, courteous and helpful. Very impressed!"}
{"input": "Strawberry smoothie, you are too good to me. If you're still okay with drinking cold drinks before work when it's 20 degrees outside, head to Starbucks. \n\nThe staff is friendly, the drinks are delicious (although they are overpriced) and all of the Christmas goodies inside are awesome. \n\nGreat place to relax or prep for a work day. \n\nSee you again soon Southport Starbucks!"}
{"input": "I came in for lunch, my group totaled eight hungry people.  There was no wait and after reading other reviews about the crowds, the stars must have aligned for us.  The parking lot was also relatively empty although I did happen to walk by the one car whose door opened just as I happened by, ouch my pancreas!\n     The server was excellent although I cannot remember her name, which is a shame 'cause she definitively deserves the cudos for dealing with my rowdy group.\n     Yes, I went and ordered the cheeseburger and fries (my kryptonite) and I must say it was perfectly cooked, the fries at the peak of crispiness and my glass never went empty.  Eight people, no complaints, all in all a great time was had by all!"}
{"input": "just average......service in Slidell   VERY GOOD!!!"}
{"input": "Almost $4 for a slice of pizza??\n\nI went to NY Pizza after a Mardi Gras parade last week. (Price gouge much?) The woman at the counter presented us with two options for individual slices: pepperoni and spinach. We asked why we couldn't see any green on top of the spinach pizza and she told us \"The spinach is under the crust\" (spoiler alert: there was no spinach!). The service was prompt, despite them being busy, and we paid and left. Within ten steps of leaving the front door, the cheese on the \"spinach\" slice slid off the bread and fell to the ground. Granted, I think this is probably in part due to the pizza-holder, but cheese should never slide off a pizza that easily. What a waste of $4. I won't be back."}
{"input": "(4) ~ Very good selection for both Cats & Dogs!  I'd describe Concord as taking Braxton's &  PetSmart and smashing them together;-)"}
{"input": "I am sad to see the ingredient changes of the Make It Grain salad and the Walnut Noodle Salad. I wonder why? Usually eat here 2-3 times a week, as my office is down the street. Used the app all of the time and my order was always ready. Thought they made a mistake putting broccoli in my Walnut Noodle Salad instead of cauliflower, but when it happened again, I googled it. Sure enough, they swapped out key ingredients. Same for Make It Grain. Why, HoneyGrow??"}
{"input": "The old saying is true! You get what you pay for!\nNot a tea bag place or Starbucks \n\nErnie,  manager, and Jennifer are very knowledgeable of teas from all over the world and how to meet strict standards\n\nIf you have to ask how much, you can't afford it! Go get Lipton tea and be happy!\n\nAfter traveling the world for 45 yrs you find better unless you go to that country ( what is cheaper?)\nI suffered from a variety of health issues that center from caffeine consumption and USA processed foods. My allergies, migraines, nicotine, and yes less medications in just a short time\n\nThanks to both of them I have better health, weight loss, and increase overall  stamina\nThank you Teavan!"}
{"input": "This update (and upgrade) to my review of Khyber is long overdue!\n\nI think the most ringing summary is that I have since moved ~1 mile further away from the Khyber, and I still go there just as often.  I have now sampled most of the menu, but the truly excellent Southern barbecue is what usually calls to me.  You can't go wrong whether you pick the brisket, the ribs, the chicken, the pulled pork or a combo of the above.  Their mac and cheese remains my favorite side, and the addition of the very good coleslaw rounds out the experience.\n\nI love the vibe of Kyber.  It usually pretty full, but they usually seem to have a table available for me (Yay!).  It is often loud, but never quite so loud that I wish it were quieter.  The staff is very knowledgeable, and happy to provide beer recommendations and taste tests of drafts.  They Khyber also manages to hit that sweet spot where I never end up being the most or least intoxicated person there!"}
{"input": "I'd rate this below average mexican food.  My fajita's tasted like they were made with ketchup :-(\n\nIt's worth the short drive to Red Mesa or the longer drive to Carmelita's (though the reviews on Yelp aren't positive, I liked Carmelita's alot)"}
{"input": "I'm a fan! Sunova beach has great drink specials and is also a good place to watch sports. I'm a big fan of being able to drink beer and watch a game outside, without melting in the sun. They pump the AC out onto the patio area to keep everyone cool while you can still enjoy the fresh air. \n\nBeer-wise, there isn't a huge selection, but there are a fair amount of drafts available. The food is good for bar food, and well priced. I like the fries (you can select one of about 10 sauces to go with them, included) and the wings. Different food and drink specials nearly every night of the week. \n\nThey also have a free parking lot so that you do not have to pay for valet (I'm looking at you Yard of Ale and McDinton's) which really kicks them up a notch. \n\nI've been probably 10 times and it was always a good experience."}
{"input": "Had a great time at the club just don't get there early I got there at about 5:30 PM when the club opened up at six when I was approached by a person it was washing the windows behind me he's a fraud he verbally violated me since I have disability he told me I was being a nuisance when I wasn't bothering anyone just because I was standing too close to the entrance then when I got some assistance to move by someone a passerby he proceeded to have a confrontation with me but I stood up for myself I have no mercy on what happens to this particular person and I hope that karma has no mercy on him either I'll definitely be back again at the club had a good time despite this stupid person! so everyone just be careful out there"}

{"input": "Found 51st Deli on Uber Eats and we loved it!!! I can't wait to check it out in person!"}
{"input": "We ordered the hot appetizer sampler, the gyro platter and the pasta Athena. Everything was delicious but I was a little uninterested in the gyro, it had a weird taste that I wasn't used to compared to other Greek places I've eaten. But my boyfriend loved it. \n\nThe service was really great and our server was very professional but friendly and personable. For our two platters and an appetizer it came to about 60. It was a cute place and a good date night place."}
{"input": "Awesome food, great place to split a bunch of delicious spicy, ultra flavorful dishes with a large group. It's the Chinese restaurant a lot of people know about for good reason - I haven't had a single bad dish here, and it's always a crowd-pleaser."}
{"input": "Awesome po-boy selection. Ifyou want to sample, they have a great Louisiana sampler as well"}
{"input": "The Indian cinnamon donuts are delicious!\n\nThe rest are just OK, the fancy donuts were nothing to rave about and I had such high expectations for the fried chicken, but it was also pretty standard stuff.\n\nBut definitely grab a dozen Indian cinnamons."}
{"input": "It is under new ownership and now called Taqueria Burrito's Grill. Absolutely delish! I love it! The green sauce rocks! I love it on cheese enchiladas. I'm picky about mexican rice and I love theirs. I recently moved back to New Orleans from Houston and one thing I miss is those little Taquerias that most people don't know about. Truly authentic mexican and they recently moved from Houston as well so I knew I was at the right place. It's the only mexican food that I can find in New Orleans East. I'll be a frequent customer. I think I am going back today! Open 7 days a week. Breakfast served 9a-11a. Open past 5PM. There # is 504-242-0573 to call for take out. YUMMY!!!!"}
{"input": "This location is just wonderful! \n\nI live very close nearby and frequent this location a few times a week. Even during busy times, they are always well-staffed, moving the lines quickly and remaining friendly. \n\nThe manager (one of the managers?) Anthony is really nice and he's been on the register a few times when I've been there. I think it's great that the manager pitches in and helps out when they're busy. He's very friendly and helpful and made a great recommendation last time I was in - honey almond cream cheese on their cinnamon crunch bagel OMG WOW GOOD. \n\nThanks for such a pleasant experience. Will be back again and again."}

{"input": "We traveled 1100 miles from bucks county, Pa. We have been checking out the reviews a week prior to our visit. We stayed in Clearwater and it was well worth the 30 minutes trip. A little very down homy type of place,with little atmosphere. Don't be fooled by the looks... But the lobster meal we had was super well worth it. We had two lobster bisque cups. Every spoon full had a large pieces of lobster chunks. It was excellent. Then we both had the lobster roll sandwich. Although the bread is not like Philadelphia quality, the lobster made up for it. The price did not out way the quality. A must do. At least once."}

Plus I didn't fee like I got the full barbershop experience: no straight razor for the neck or side part, no blow drying to style my hair, and his products were American crew. Would I go back? Probably. But I'd hope to find a barber that more fits my style."}
{"input": "The best Jamaican food ever. Fresh and home cooked food. This is one of the better restaurants in Tampa, period."}
{"input": "Excellent gas fired oven pizza   !!!\n\nNo wood in sight but.   Hey great fun\n\n\nTry the margherita"}
{"input": "Good choice in Union Station St. Louis.  I had the Ponchartrain (server said it is same as Tilapia, though that was also on the menu, so why two names for the same fish, I have no clue).  The Ponchartrain was quite good with mushrooms and a cream sauce.  We also had the shrimp cocktail and lump crab cake appetizers....both fine, but not wonderful.  Drinks and service were perfectly acceptable.  We dined outside on the patio since the weather was nice - inside looks comfy and a bit less casual."}
{"input": "Great place for lunch in NOLA. Love their fried chicken, and the red beans and rice is yummy too. It's a staple on our trips to town. Staff is friendly and attentitve and prices are great."}
{"input": "Upscale place, food is great here and next door at Kona's. Live music in the back at Apri's. Whole package, you won't be disappointed."}
{"input": "Stopped here for lunch on the way to drop some people off at the airport. It's a bit unexpected and a tiny bit off the beaten path on a residential street just behind a business district.\n\nI chose the vegetarian plate and a Greek salad. The salad was the absolute best I've ever had. The cheese was absolutely fresh, the vegetables were fresh and chopped just for the salad, and the dressing and seasoning was perfect. The salad was quite large on its own and could easily make a light lunch by itself.\n\nThe vegetarian plate came along with their fresh pita-like bread that is baked fresh every morning, seasoned, pan fried vegetables, rice, and a tzatziki-like sauce drizzled on top. The flavors were astounding, and despite a lack of desire to stuff myself silly, I did anyway. Plenty of food for lunch and very reasonably priced."}
{"input": "How can I not rate this 5 stars? It's free - they give you a little tour, the guy was funny, I pet a Clydesdale horse and got a little free cup of beer and a free 16 ounce beer of my choice! (of which there were many choices - not just bud/bud light) We waited maybe 40 minutes for the tour to begin.... meaning we walked in... went to the desk and the next tour that had openings was in 40 minutes. \n\nNow! It was a busy Saturday and I think our tour group was too large and some of the tour got maybe left off, so maybe go earlier or go during the week... still a great tour and some beers. Nice facility. We'll be back!\n\nOK that being said they have tours that cost money that are more in-depth, but I was specifically referring to the complimentary tour."}
{"input": "Went here to try out the two basketball courts I saw listed......waste of my time. Neither one is playable and both have been seriously neglected. All of the rims are very crooked and bent down significantly. The pavement hasn't been redone in years and has grass growing throughout it. Hopefully they put the time into redoing it because a decent outdoor court in this area would be great addition to the park."}
{"input": "Just having moved here, I've been spurned by previous take out experience that I was hesitant about ordering from yet another Chinese food place. I was completely wrong!\nThe Taiwanese sausage rice noodles were great, chicken fried rice was excellent, and the garlic chicken had spice but not enough to make your mouth feel like it was burning. 10/10 would definitely go back and try other items on their menu. \nThe only thing I thought tasted weird were the wontons in the wonton soup, it had a different taste to what I had been used to but the other food we ordered were great so it's not enough to turn me away from going back to their place."}
{"input": "What a cool museum! Lots of hands-on, engaging displays. Wide variety of activities from science to art to exploring jobs like boat pilot and being a vet. Not so big to feel overwhelming, relatively healthy food option (subway) and no gift shop to try and wrangle your munchkins through. \n\nThe museum is clean, staff friendly, and safety has been thought about in each exhibit. This is truly one of the best museums we have seen in a bit - and our keepers agreed (and had as much fun as us monkeys!).\n\nThe Verdict: If you are in Tampa and looking for a great activity, check this space out - you won't be sorry!\n\nEnjoy the Ride!\nBaker & Biker"}
{"input": "Awesome experience! Just ate here for the first time and wow it was good. Our meals came very quickly and tasted great! Our waiter, Lyndel, was very amazing and made our experience memorable. The restaurant felt a tad bit cramped, but other than that everything was awesome."}
{"input": "I decided to try this spot after the reviews of the Fried Chicken. It definitely didn't disappoint. Crispy, not greasy and very juicy. The biscuit was light and flakey and the rice was absolutely delicious. For sure this is going to be a regular stop when in NOLA.\n\nP.S.  in the excitement, I forgot to grab my wallet when leaving my hotel room and didn't realize it until I was placing my order. Rather than send me on my way, the manager on duty told me to just bring the money tomorrow! I truly appreciate the gesture and find it refreshing that small business owners place this level of trust in their clientele. Thank you Julie!"}
{"input": "Back from Reno and couldn't wait to review this place. We went here because it was right across the street from Peppermill where we stayed. I checked out yelp before I came and again it was highly recommended. WRONG! Are you smoking people? Did you drink the nasty water that was filled right from the counters faucet in front of you? I wouldn't have been able to keep that down to save my life. Just for the water alone, this place looses 3 stars! \n\nOK, as for the food. \n- Mongolian beef... did they spill the sugar? The beef was chewy and the overly sweet. Yuck! \n- Hot and sour soup - decent! \n- Salt and pepper fried fish - too salty, but decent... drink up the nasty water! \n- Chicken fried rice - bland but decent \n- Price - decent \n- Ambiance - Hole on the wall... we watched the rain come down and some guy getting arrested in the lot next door \n\nSave your money and go eat at El Pollo Loco instead."}
{"input": "Its a local bar that if you like slow service and bartenders that just cuss like sailors then go here....typical bar food cooked with no love."}
{"input": "Very happy with my experience here the other day. Couldn't get into my regular doctor due to scheduling issues so I figured I'd try the urgent care near work. Including paperwork, seeing PA, and getting Rx- I was in and out in 30 mins. They didn't have me sitting in the room waiting for long periods of time to see the PA either. Staff was very nice and didn't seem bothered that I came in close to the end of their night. They also called me the day after to make sure I didn't have further questions. Would definitely recommend to others."}
{"input": "Just another delightful stop during my New Orleans visit. Loved the look of it when we first walked in as it resembles an old fashioned ice cream parlor, Next the plethora of unique flavors. The hardest part was deciding on which flavors to choose. The mini scoop samplers are the way to go, that way you can try a variety. I got a sampler and I cannot say there was one flavor I did not like. This place is a must stop. Oh, and the staff was super friendly too, even with a line out the door. Cash only"}
{"input": "Terrible place with an even worse owner!!! As a former veteran I was deeply offended when my wife and I over heard the owner saying some horrible things about veterans. It took every ounce of energy for me not to lose my temper!! But we left instead to go across the street to much better bar in Bruno's. To sum it all up, he does not appreciate veterans in his bar, so we are happy to help him out with that!! What a piece of work!!!"}
{"input": "Absolutely terrible service!!! Do not waste a nice day/evening in this beautiful town at this place"}
{"input": "So if you ever wondered what it felt like takin it back to the 70's this is the place to be. This is a cool place to come chill have so drinks listen to some old 70's & 80's music videos blaring and just chill by the fire. \n\nThe Peppermill is my favorite place to stay at in Reno and this is a must every time. They have awesome free hour doves during happy hour. Shrimp cocktails, wontons, etc. Usually if you stay there you get a buy one drink get one free coupon so don't waste it.\n\nThe ambience is dope, they actually had the same Peppermill here in Sacramento back in the day same decor and all but is now a Elephant Bar. Old school couches, fire pit, neon lights everywhere, dark, chill vibe. Gotta see it to fully grasp how cool it is. \n\nIt's really tucked away in the casino, almost hidden but it's defiantly worth finding! They have all your basic well drinks but a wide variety of tropical cool drinks to choose from. This has to be the best lounge in Reno overall."}
{"input": "I am a vegitarian and so finding good veggie rolls that i enjoy is hard, but the guys at icheban know how to do it right! \nI go regularly becasue they know exactly what i like as soon as i get in, and they custom make my order becasue I don't eat fish. The sushi chefs are super funny and and hook it up everytime! \nThis is by far my favorite sushi restaurant in Santa Barbara...\n-GREAT FOOD\n-good prices\n-convienient location\n-good service!!\n\nI LOVE ICHEBAN!!!!"}
{"input": "Really yummy donuts!  I loved going in there - the ladies at the counter were great!"}
{"input": "The food & service were excellent, but the ambiance is so drab, it takes away from the experience. Maybe better suited for lunch. Enjoyed the mushroom salad. Would also recommend the duck & white fish entrees."}
{"input": "India Palace has saved my life several times, both due to its easily accessible location in the International Marketplace just off 65, and the fact that it opens for dinner starting at 5pm.  They also have FIFTEEN vegetarian entrees, plus a super delicious vegetable biryani.  Once seated you will be treated with water, menus, a basket of papadum, and an assortment of chutneys (mint, onion, and tamarind) which you will happily devour while deciding what to order.\n\nWhat you should get:\n*GARLIC NAAN (if you don't try this without a very good reason, I will probably unfriend you)\n*Paneer chilli (delicious cheese cubes in a rich, spicy, tomato-based sauce - my favorite)\n*Nav ratan korma (veggies cooked with herbs, cashews, raisins - also fantastic)\n*Aloo mattar (peas and potatoes with a spicy sauce - my potato-loving husband's go-to dish)\n\nThe staff are very helpful and I've taken their advice on several occasions when I've been overwhelmed by the options - it's good advice.  Munch on!"}
{"input": "I consider myself a connoisseur of both Mexican food and hot dogs, so I can't believe it took me this long to stop by BK. I ordered a cabeza taco, small al pastor caramelo, and sonoran hot dog. The ambiance of this place is a little weird, but it was nice to have plenty of TVs showing college football. \n\nThe cabeza was delicious, rich, and fatty, and I wish I had ordered one more. The caramelo (basically a 2-tortilla quesadilla with meat) was good as well, even though they gave me carne asada instead of al pastor. The hot dog was fine, but it didn't blow me away like some others I've had around town. The serve-yourself salsa/condiment bar is great: pickled onions, several types of red and green salsas, cabbage, limes, etc.\n\nPrices here are pretty reasonable, but be advised that caramelo/taco portions are kind of small. If you're a big dude like me, you're gonna have to get about 3 tacos or a large caramelo. Overall, a tasty and filling place that I will certainly come back to."}
{"input": "My husband and I have been here a number of times and the food is typical beach eatery  I always enjoyed the food. Today , however ,the  platter I ordered was pretty bad. Crab cake , not much crab was lukewarm and mushy, scallops undercooked and fish overlooked and dry. Nothing was hot.  Not going back anytime soon\nServer was very nice though."}

{"input": "First time checking it out first breakfast as recommended by a friend! Service was quick and friendly. It was a busy Saturday morning but we got seated right away. I loved the veggie omelette with fruit and rye toast. Overall good selection to fit anyone's tastes. Reasonable prices for the amount of food. Will be back again!"}
{"input": "We ran in for a late night dinner last night. The prices are definitely high. Both couples decided to split a plate (you could tell the annoyed our server), and the food was good- but not worth the price for sure.\nI will say the garlic bread they bring out before the meal was AH-MAZING! I could have probably eaten my weight in just the bread. \n\nOverall - I probably wouldn't eat there again myself. But it could have been an off night. There is just too much competition in the food world around St Louis!"}
{"input": "Some of the fare on offer at That BBQ Place is wildly overpriced, especially given the fact that real cutlery, proper table service, and glassware are all missing.  While this place is as neat as a pin and while it offers very friendly service, I'm unlikely to return.  It won't matter, though, for it's busy enough that my custom is unlikely to be missed.  Their ribs still lack bark and they remain too moist for my liking.  In the end, Sherwood Parkers seem to like the place and that's all that matters for the owners."}
{"input": "Thank you Chef John Besh!  My husband and I stayed at the Hilton hotel on St. Charles. One of my main goals was to find some delicious New Orleans grinds.  I was starving when we arrived and didn't want to do any research on Yelp for a place to eat.  Thank God Luke was connected to our hotel!!!  We ended up eating here 3 times over 5 days.  It's usually full of business suits, but that doesn't bother me when the food is so good.\n\nAll the traditional dishes were good, but the huge surprise was the burger.  I was against ordering a burger while I was in New Orleans, because I wanted to try as many local eats as possible... and you can find burgers anywhere.  I overheard this lady raving about how delicious her burger was, so I had to order it the next time we ate there.  She was absolutely right!  It was one of the best burgers I've ever had!  It was huge, juicy, and packed with flavor.  I also highly recommend getting their bread pudding a la mode.  It was mouth-watering good and straight out the oven!"}
{"input": "That chicken sandwich. Damn! \nReally great food and dessert.\nThe French Macaroons are awesome and try some of the other cookies and assorted goods as well. \nI just shave a star off for price as it is a bit too much. \nOtherwise, cozy and efficient little shop and definitely worth a visit if you are on the go. Not too much seating."}
{"input": "Absolutely one of the best experiences for myself and my family.  \n\nThis review is waaaaay overdue.  We arrived to Terrell House for a wedding.  The place is spectacular.  Like stepping into the 1800s, except with all the modern accomodations (AC, etc).\n\nLinda, the owner is a sweetheart.  She's a wonderful and kind person with a whole lot of patience for a 16 month old that thinks every sphere shaped object is a bouncy ball.\n\nEvery morning the chef waited for us to come downstairs before putting out some delicious, authentic Louisiana food.  Seriously...it was exceptional.\n\nMore of awesome treatment...skipping to the end.  We thanked everyone and left, forgetting our car seat and some other items.  \n\nLinda, shipped the items to us out of her own pocket...!!!!!!  WHAT?  I have never heard of such AMAZING treatment.\n\nThere's no other place that I will even consider staying at when I visit New Orleans.\n\nA HUGE thank you Linda and the staff,\n\nKevin, Katrina and Abby"}
{"input": "I like this salon . The employees are very nice and everyone is competent.\nI did change though as the last two times I was there the operator who I had an appointment with was not the person who colored my hair. I hate it when I have an appointment with an operator and you wind up getting your hair colored by a junior. \nIf your operator is too busy to work with you that means the salon over booked.\n Since this happened two visits in a row I can only assume Fiber does this as a rule.\nI am now going to Onde in Newtown Square."}

{"input": "A consistently wonderful venue for any occasion!  Bob Menendez is a class act and hires excellent folks to fulfill your every wish.  The food is superb!"}
{"input": "This is a low lit traditional college bar with few accoutrements and base service. There are a couple pool tables, the wings are quite good, I fell for their sweet potato fried which looked a bit burnt on the ends but tasted great. Don't expect to be doted on. Some nice largeish table to gather with your friends and gossip over a beverage."}
{"input": "I was SUPER excited to find out a Bubba Gump was opening in Edmonton, I had been to the Anaheim location 6 years ago and couldn't wait to try it again.  The new restaurant is BEAUTIFUL, love the memorabilia and the setting in general.  The staff that we had were fantastic, the reason I'm giving this a 4 star otherwise I'd have to give a 3.  Our table had fish and chips, the Shrimper's Heaven, a shrimp cocktail and a caesar salad.  The Fish and chips were hot but the pieces were very small, it wasn't what we expected.  The shrimp in the Shrimper's Heaven was great but unfortunately the fries were barely warm.  The shrimp in the cocktail were huge, and the salad good, I'd say the cocktail was the best part, although it was $17.  Overall it is a fun restaurant and I'd go again but maybe for a special treat as it was fairly expensive.  I'm still happy Bubba Gump is here!"}
{"input": "This is sort of our secret place for lunch. It has great food, decent prices and the staff is friendly. It's a bit quiet when you walk in, but don't let that throw you off, the food is amazing. :)"}
{"input": "Truly awful! I chose this as my birthday lunch place with a friend. The counter clerk/meal maker was disinterested, bordering on rude. This is a small place, so four dirty, unbussed tables are noticeable. After cleaning our own table, we waited and waited. There was no one ahead of us. Finally our paninis were served: both were badly burned. Who serves burned food, unless you just don't care? The salad was bland. The coffee was fine."}
{"input": "Had a wonderful experience today with my daughter and soon to be daughter in law.  Great job Lana and GiGi!.  Absolutely recommend."}
{"input": "So after a 30 minute plus wait for Saturday brunch I was excited just to sit down. They had water at the table and two glasses filled, luke warm tap water. So let's just say I couldn't be happier to get my mimosa which was pretty tasty. That waiter Jonathan was great very attentive and friendly. I ordered a Monte cristo, French toast honey roasted ham, mascarpone and pineapple I couldn't wait to dig in. My boyfriend ordered salmon Beni and it looked fabulous. Just as I took a bite of my sandwich which was great  my boyfriends facial expression changed as he pulled a long piece of blond hair from his food. Needless to say we were done, however they did comp our meal and gave us a few free doughssants.  They were very apologetic about the incident.  I think I'll probably go back again but not sure I could convince my man to."}
{"input": "My husband and I love biscuits and as in a previous review, love the theme.  Did not know one needed to be right to enjoy the patriotism but do.  You are greeted like an old friend when you enter.  The food tastes good, which is why we keep going back.  We have lots of choices and the atmosphere and food are winners.  Our 7 year old grandson went with us last weekend and the waitress really embellished his hot chocolate - his eyes almost popped out of his head.  He ate almost all of his very generous two eggs (more like three), his bacon and two HUGE pancakes.  \n\nThe biscuits and gravy are what we normally get - it is very tasty. \n\nMy only complaint would be the processed swiss cheese in the scrambles vs regular swiss but that is a small issue to me and I should not be eating any cheese anyway so I skip.  \n\nBISCUITS HAS FREE WIRELESS. YEA!!!\n\nYes, we are fans."}

{"input": "Wow, great meal on Frenchmen Street... scallops, feta fries, pork belly, lamb burger, very nice.  A little more pricey of a dinner than your traditional New Orleans fare, but definitely worth the price.  \n\nWe had eight which is a few too many for this place, but we broke up into groups of five and three.  Great place to order a number of things and eat family style.\n\nEnjoy!"}
{"input": "Jazz brunch was amazing! \n\nFood - everything we ordered was great! Thanks for all the yelp recommendations. We went with the shrimp and goat cheese crepe, shrimp and andouille sausage omlet, and eggs benedict. We were so stuffed we couldn't bring ourselves to order the bread pudding. \n\nMusic - at first we couldn't really hear the music, but to our pleasant surprise, the band moved from room too room and ended up playing right next to our table! The musicians were amazing. Loved all their energy and talent. \n\nHighly recommend!"}
{"input": "The hotel seemed fine to me for the money, even with the resort fees.  It's only 20 mins to downtown.  I do think that some of the valets need more training though.  Some of the them couldn't answer basic questions like \"where is the spa entrance\" (which is basically right there near the front of the hotel but has quirky access point).  Still, the valets were speedy and otherwise very friendly."}
{"input": "I like the ambiance and the decor of this coffee shop a lot! But, I'm not a big fan of their coffee drinks. The drinks themselves are very pretty, they do some sort of art on top of the foam. But, the taste is just alright... I ordered a soy latte and it already came sweet. I don't like sugar or sweetness in my drinks and regularly a soy latte wouldnt come sweet unless I ask for syrup or add sugar. Also, their drinks arn't hot enough-- both mine and my boyfriend's hot beverages were just slightly warm. I'm sure they're fresh as I watched them make it but maybe they didn't steam the soy milk enough."}
{"input": "I saw that this place when I was meeting for one of my girlfriends for lunch at Michael's Deli. She was running late, so I decided that I would get her a treat. Batch had an interesting selection of cupcakes available. I bought 5 cupcakes, 1 which was regular vanilla and the other just regular chocolate. They weren't anything to rave about. The other 3 cupcakes I gave to my friend, but they were...maple, red velvet, and oreo. I didn't get a chance to taste these specialty ones, but my friend said she enjoyed them. Although the Vanilla and Chocolate were quite plain, I think I'll go back to try the other cupcakes. I will say that the cupcakes were moist inside, which was really nice."}
{"input": "Great place to order a fresh bagel and have a relaxing seat and enjoy breakfast."}
{"input": "If good beer is what you seek, look no further! Bier has got it going on and proudly has all their accolades displayed on the wall as they should. The Belgian dubbel won second at a world beer festival (excuse me for not remembering the official name), so you know it's legit when they make it better than most Belgians do.\n\nThe staff is SO friendly and willing to answer any and all questions about the beers, brewing process and their business. It's family owned and they brew 150 different beers a year. Every week the tap list rotates and it'll never be the same twice. \n\nThey have trivia, live music, euchre tournament, and other events throughout the week, and unfortunately I didn't get to sample the food truck when I was there but I've heard it's great. If you're in Indy Bier is not to be missed!"}

{"input": "My husband and are new to Dtown and love Thai food.   We decided to try this place because of the reviews and we were extremely disappointed.   The food was bland and didn't resemble any Thai cuisine favors I've ever had.    For a place with Spice on the name, this was far from that."}
{"input": "The nicest people in the world work here.  I've purchased gardening goods and had a gazillion keys cut here and have never been disappointed or had to return a key because it didn't work.  I drive across the city to get keys made now instead of chancing a few trips to Home Depot. The amount of stuff packed into this place is impressive, and yet it doesn't feel cluttered.  Prices are also incredibly reasonable. Good stuff."}
{"input": "This was by far the worst dinner I have ever had. There were 4 of us: 1 only ate the meatballs, as the pasta had pizza sauce on them and were cold, 2nd ate 5 bites of his clam (canned) linguini because there was 3/4 cup of olive oil at the bottom of the bowl and no garlic or seasoning, 3rd, mine was over cooked chicken parm, eggplant parm was dry and over cooked and the ravioli were over salted...pizza sauce and melted cheese over the top. The service was bad and no compensation for any of it. AND it took 1 Hour to get served."}
{"input": "This place is horrible! I recently purchased a jeep from there, and everything seemed great at first. Not 2 days after purchasing the jeep, the front left brake locked up and almost threw me off the road. So I brought the vehicle back and they fixed the front left brake..... Wouldn't you think to check the other one? They didn't and 4 months later the front right brake does the same thing...... Now they say oh well and I have to fork over a bunch of money to fix it! If I spend 30k on a jeep, I shouldn't have these kind of issues nor should I be responsible for it. This place is a disgrace and I  will actively tell people never to go there!!!! Run away from this scam of a place!!!"}
{"input": "We had been here for Monday night football and liked the divey atmosphere.  We saw the sign the next day for 2 for 1 sammies, and knew the happy hour beer was great.  Much to our surprise it was bike night, 2for1 draft and 2 for 1 sammies!  Our bartender/cook was fantastic, no empty cups and the cooking show was fun.  The single server was keeping up with floor orders and helping refill the bar!  The food was fantastic.  We ordered the club, and the Titan cheesesteak, you can't go wrong.  The night before we got the regular cheesesteak, it came with cheese whiz, so good.  Definitely worth checking out."}
{"input": "I have been a loyal customer at Magasin Cafe for years, it's what made me fall in love with Vietnamese food. Since Magasin Cafe has closerd for renovations I came to Magasin Kitcheb to curb my weekly pho cravings. The food and service were good- even the chopped was seasoned better than the other location. However, paying more money for the same meal and the restaurants atmosphere deters the ranking. Quality food and service will continue to keep me a loyal customer."}
{"input": "This restaurant is a nice place to go and sit down to have something to eat. I've ate just about everything they have on the menu and I'd say their burgers are great. Although their pizza is a bit on the tough side I still manage to eat the crust too. \n\nVery comfortable dining room area as well!"}

I am a very jittery, twitchy, shaky person by nature, but john was AMAZING & so kind! I am definitely coming back & recommending this place to friends :)"}
{"input": "Popped in for a quick manicure and decided to get a chair massage while my nails dried. Manicure was no frills but very good and the chair massage was awesome. I believe therapists name was LaTrussa (sp?) \n\nPrices were decent especially for The French Quarter. I will definitely come back."}
{"input": "Mediocre food with good services. However, I had to wait over 20 minute for my food since appetizer and it kills my appetite. It would speed up the process more if the chefs in the open kitchen would get down to cooking instead of checking their phones for texts from grandma."}
{"input": "Poor service from the door. Stood at the door for 15 mins, walked in when it was not super busy it was Thursday at 12pm. I'm pregnant and there is no more seating area, which I think was a stupid decision when they reopen so they can flip more tables. Was ignored by 2 staff members who seating 3 people before me. Food was cold the times I come in there. The French toast is horrible. They just good making basic eggs that doesn't take much flavor or time. I get the actual egg not the ready made batter. Over fried meats. Burnt has Browns. Save your money & go to a mom & pop local diner to get more for your money."}
{"input": "I had a cup of roasted black coffee and one croissant. They were nice. I felt foods offered were a little bit expensive, but drink was not so. There was a nice environment to study, so I could concentrate on my work. Not loud, good location to access, and friendly staffs. It was pity I couldn't use rest room though."}
{"input": "Great results from BioLift Facial. Diana was wonderful and knowledgeable. Had a noticeable difference from my facial. She explained the process at every phase and made great recommendations about how I can maintain my skin. Will definitely come back.  I also brought my teenager who recieved a very age appropriate facial at a reasonable price along with great instructions from Becca. A great mother/daughter day. Thank you!"}
{"input": "Their lunch buffet is to die for! They have many dishes that aren't on the regular menu. But if you write down the name, they can make it for you special next time you come in. I never knew I love Indian food so much before I came here.  The Carrot hawalla ( spelling?) is incredible. And the prices are excellent. We eat here at least 3 times a month. Look for them on groupon and buy as many as you can. By far my favorite restaurant."}
{"input": "Been here many times now since moving to Apollo Beach. The pizza is very solid and consistent. I especially like the crust as you can take one look and know that it is hand tossed and not \"machine-made\" as some places do. \n\nI have not tried anything else on their menu. What can I say ... I'm a pizza guy!  Oh ... And they always honor their coupons when you check in."}
{"input": "Great location, close to all the \"tourist-y\" stuff.  Hotel is beautiful!  You can walk to everything including the Arch and Busch Stadium.  Close to dining.  Felt safe there and the staff was excellent!!"}
{"input": "Would I come here again? Probably. I'd give it another shot and try flour tortillas with chicken for my tacos this time though. The corn tortillas are thick, so thick they kind of fall apart when you're eating your tacos. I felt like the taste of the corn over powered the meat. I had carne asada tacos, the meat was ok quality, I got a lot of gristle which wasn't the greatest. The rice, beans and horchata were all A+. Be warned, the chili they serve here is really, really hot. Normally I love hot chili/salsa, but this one kind of left my mouth numb and it didn't really have a flavor."}
{"input": "Standard Jimmy Johns fare: nothing especially good or bad about this one. Restaurant was very clean."}
{"input": "Cannot vouch for the doctor, as the receptionist was so breathtakingly rude that I didn't even schedule an appointment. They might want to rethink their desk staff if they want to appear welcoming and friendly."}
{"input": "When I was in high school this was a regular market with a meat counter and limited groceries.  Now they specialize in take out sandwiches and I have to say the the quality of the rolls, meats and cheeses are top rate.  The large hoagie is enough for two and they will package onions, peppers etc on the side so you can share and still get your half the way you want it.  Our favorites are the Italian and the turkey with oil instead of mayo.  Call ahead as they can take a while to make, especially if you order several (we had four on Saturday).  Just wish they had brewed ice tea in addition to the bottled version."}
{"input": "Great place to eat. My family loves it and they are terrific as far as food quality and service."}
{"input": "Swung by here while I was in town and was so happy I did. Great atmosphere, great staff and delicious food. The warm tortilla chips and salsa were quite tasty. I recommend the fish tacos."}
{"input": "Daniel and Ben exceeded my expectations with their level of dedication and professionalism in helping me get the heat working at my house during the frigid cold blast we had last week. Before swapping parts out and increasing the repair cost, they were able to fix the wiring on the unit and saved me a lot of money. I would recommend them to anyone looking for fair, honest service. Much appreciated guys!!!"}
{"input": "Oh my, when we said we were going to Franklin my friend's younger daughter asked us to stop by this candy shop for her favorite...  And they had some super tasty stuff. Loved the self serve jars. They had cute displays for Easter when I was there.\n\nAnd I was able to buy bulk Spree (which I am NEVER allowed to do again) and some old school satellites (like communion wafers filled with candy) and some fancy chocolates.\n\nReally cute addition to the area."}
{"input": "What a great find. In town on business in Safety Harbor and looking for a local place where I can get a vegetarian dish. Oh my, the fried cauliflower small dish was delicious and the Beet Salad is to die for. A great combo for those who don't eat meat and plenty of food. The couple I was finding with swore the short ribs were so tasty, fall off the bone and melt in your mouth. Finished off our delicious dining experience we had the fried donuts with a Carmel sauce. Yum. Will come back when we return in 6 months."}

I am usually amenable to contemporary art, but I wasn't feeling this exhibit I saw. And it seemed to be the same artist throughout. Was hoping for some diversity. Maybe I missed it? \n\nIt has potential..."}

[Same with the only other car in front of me.] \"You will have to wait.\" came from the speaker. Several minutes later I said hello. Again,  \"You will have to wait, we are busy.\" But, we were the only customers.. Wow.. Then came on the speaker, \"What do you want?\" Very rudely.. Wow.. When I reached the window, no customers inside. The staff acted like they were put out, having to serve a customer. \nI'm hoping the person that was going to start-up a Bagel Shop will do so soon.."}

{"input": "If you're looking for dentists who are detail oriented and friendly, precise dental is the right place to go to. The technicians were very skillful, and the dentist, Dr. Tanner, is very kind. He will discuss with you any concerns that you may have, and will make good referrals to other orthodontists or surgeons if needed. I think I found my new general dentist; Dr.Tanner is one of the best dentists that I have seen."}
{"input": "Has to be the best khmer restaurant in philadelphia.  Great food! great service and fair price.  Pa-Hok with veggie is freaking awesome.  Fried frog legs! My new home away from home."}
{"input": "I went there on a Saturday night with a reservation.  Was seated right away.  I really love this place!  The menu is very diversified and the service is exceptional.  I had the filet with mashed potatoes and vegetables-the topping on the filet was so good, the vegetables were very tasty and the mashed potatoes were the best tasting I have ever had.  Love the decor and the atmosphere.   Plan on going back , luckily I work right across the street!!!  Can't wait to try more of the menu.  Had the toasted pound cake for dessert-yum! - very different from the usual."}
{"input": "Really good, really authentic! This is some of the BEST Mexican cuisine I've tasted since my nana cooked for me; I'm from California so I would know. The enchiladas w/mole are awesome and the carne asada tacos remind me of Rosarito Beach, yummy!"}
{"input": "First time being here.  It was a nice place but empty.  Had one old man sitting in there, then us two 40 somethings, then another old man.  That was it.   We came during happy hour, basically waiting for Snake and Jakes to open up so we came here to kill some time.  \n\nBeer selection was nice, Magic Hat, Fat Tire, Blue Moon, etc.  Prices were ok too.\n\nLotsa dark woods and a few TVs and a lonely but attractive bartender that was very nice.  \n\nNothing bad to say about this place other than it was kinda dead.  It was very clean looking and nicely decorated, just kinda boring."}
{"input": "My husband and I went out to Red Pony on a date night a few months ago and had an exceptional time.  We were first treated to an gnocchi appetizer as the chef was \"trying out\" a new menu.  Delicious.  Shortly after we ordered, the manager informed us that our dinners might take longer than expected - they were dealing with a large party upstairs.  He offered us a complimentary salad, but we declined, as we wanted to save room for dinner.  I was very appreciative that he informed us BEFORE we had waited a long time, or had to ask our waiter where the food was.  Well, it did end up taking quite some time for our dinner, but we enjoyed our drinks, and really didn't mind.  After we received our dinners and had a chance to taste everything, the manager came back and informed us that our entrees were on the house.  Amazing.  You forget sometimes what good customer service is until you have a great experience like this.  The food was delicious.  We will absolutely be back."}
{"input": "I will first start by saying that the service here is some of the best I've ever had. Friendly, knowledgable and there for anything you ask for immediately without being over bearing.\nNow to the food, we started off with the antipasto, a weekend special, and it was amazing. Prosciutto, mortadella, sharp provolone, stuffed peppers and many other thing, marinated in a delicious oil, it was perfect. \nI got the porterhouse steak special next topped with Gorgonzola and an amazing steak sauce. Cooked veggies and mashed potatoes on the side, it was perfectly cooked and everything went perfect with the next thing. My girlfriend got the lasagna which had the best mozzarella cheese I've had, and the sauce was also amazing. \nWe got the Tierra massou finally and that was perfect as well. \nBetween the perfect food and the great service I would highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"input": "Terrible delivery service & food order was incorrect once received an hour over what I was told.  All the food was under or over cooked.  Never again!  Sad"}
{"input": "Oh Pizzarella Grille- I want to love you. I've been going more than I should - and I'm fairly sure you alone are responible for having to buy 36\" pants.\n\nSalad is great (Main line is yummy), the mini-pizzas are made to order. The management seems to be in a constant state of changing - along with the artwork and menu. I'm not sure if it's changed hands a few times or what but the setup has lost consistency. \n\nI'd avoid the pasta dishes; Shrimp Scampi and Lasagna were both pretty bland. Stick with salad and pizza."}
{"input": "I'll go back. Got a lb of brisket and a lb of pulled pork. Both were very very yummy. I'm shorting them stars for the sides, though. At the risk of sounding full of myself my Mac and Cheese is better. Also their burnt end beans were too heavy on the mustard for me. My kids dug their shoe string fries. I'll definitely go back for the meat. Maybe I'll give the coleslaw a try."}
{"input": "Great place to go with both your friends and/or family. You get your food very fast, you never have to wait even during their busiest hoirs. The staff works very fast and is very friendly and welcoming to their customers. I visit the bar weekly, because I always enjoy my time there, along with my food and drinks."}
{"input": "Great place for all types of pet supplies, including costumes!"}
{"input": "So I went to this fine establishment yesterday after a night out on the town. Was looking for some quality pizza and possibly some wings. The wait was a little long but not terrible considering the night rush. I got a large pepperoni and a dozen wings with a side of hot sauce. Everything sounds great right? Pizza tastes good, wings taste good. Me being slightly... buzzed thought nothing of the bill... after all my main mission was to get Pizza. It wasn't until I collected myself this morning that I realized how ridiculous it was that I spent 32 bucks on a pep pizza and a dozen wings. I think you guys can do the math. I got fleeced in my moment of drunkin pizza need. Anyway, go next door. These guys can't operate like decent human beings. I'm sure the owner will read this so my message is: yeah we might be drunk when we order but we remember the next day and apparently this isn't an isolated event according to my friends. Deuces.

{"input": "The person next door reported a leak coming from my condo to hers.  I didn't see how this could be.  I checked everything, noticed a small amount of water in floor by bathtub which I assumed spilled from showering, i.e., curtain not pulled tight.  However, I called Tom She'll plumbing to see if there was an actual leak.  They arrived at appointed time, I discussed the issue with them, they checked everything thoroughly, and discovered a small leak at the commode which in time would flow toward the bathtub.  They replaced the flapper and internal parts and made sure there was no leak.  Dan said that there would be no charge until it was sure that repair solved the leak issue.  This water somehow traveled at least 8 feet to cause an issue next door.  After several days, the person next door said the issue was solved.  Good work guys!"}
{"input": "THE BEST place to go for gyros! The quality of their food is amazing. I always get chicken gyros here but they have all kinds of goodies. My daughter loves their burgers. And the thick, perfectly seasoned steak fries are the bomb! Always hot and fresh. \n\nThe only thing I did not care for was the baklava. They make it with pistacios."}
{"input": "The food was amazing! BUT, the service was terrible. After we received our food, we didn't see our waitress until we were done. We were the only ones there and she was nowhere to be found. We wanted to order more drinks, but was unable to. When we received our check, she threw/slammed the pen on the table. She was very rude. I don't think it was anything we did because the only interaction we had with her was when we ordered and received our food. I don't expect people to kiss the ground I walk on, but if you work in service, provide that pleasant service; not an attitude. Needless to say, we will not be going back."}
{"input": "Delicious, healthy, home-cooked style food. Highly recommended!"}
{"input": "By far my favorite sushi place in St. Louis.  The food and the service are outstanding.  I highly recommend the Fancy Roll, the Yummy Roll, and the pot stickers are amazing.  The sauce they make for the pot stickers is their own recipe and it's delicious.  Ask for it to dip your sushi in too."}
{"input": "Visited the preserve today based on reviews and was VERY pleased.  \n\nThe hikes are great! Lots of wildlife and nature to see on clearly marked paths. \nThe birds of prey aviary is wonderful and the learning center not only presents educational information in a beautiful manner, but the AC was a nice break after the hike.  \n\nIf you make your way over in the mid afternoon you may be lucky enough to see the birds up close with the handlers. \n\nAll the staff and volunteers are friendly and helpful."}
{"input": "The best! The staff are the cutest, friendliest people you'll ever meet. Food came out quick, reasonably priced, delicious and as described in the menu. They also serve these funky chips to eat while you're waiting on your meal. Would definitely recommend if you enjoy Thai."}

{"input": "The room is adequate.  However the parking structure was completely full and there was no additional parking.  We called on the evening of arrival to ask for them to bring blankets for the fold out bed., and towels.  The NEVER came.  When we were\ngoing out for the day. we called the front desk to ask that our room be tidied up, but when we returned the room had not been touched.  We also let the housekeeper in hallway know we were leaving the room for a while if she could please\nmake up the beds.  There was 1 bath towel in the room.  When I called for towels. was told they will be coming out of the dryer soon.   I would NOT recommend this hotel as there are several in the area and I'm quite sure you will receive better service at another hotel."}
{"input": "We had two items on the menu.  Lettuce wraps and Almond Chicken.  We came with a coupon and found it could only be used on some items.  The Almond Chicken was eh ok but the rice served with it was cold.  The lettuce wraps filling was also cold.  The lettuce were pieces torn and thrown on a plate resembling no shells served with care.  The filling was bland even with salt and pepper and soy sauce.  In short they were awful.  For 9 dollars I was expecting more.  The food, service and price were not worth the one star given, I would not bother, its not worth it!"}

{"input": "Freedom toast = check, freedom fries = check, awesome breakfast food = check.\n\nThe is a greek owned pancake house (hence the over doing it on naming the food) and is a great alternative to your larger chain pancake houses such as Robert Evans, IHopity hop, and Mr. Dennys. \n\nWe eat here every new years day, typically around 2 pm when we drag ourselves out of a drunken slumber to brave the bitter cold. They never have a problem seating our group of about 12-15 and are pleasant and quick service. \n\nThe energetic owner likes to roam around making sure everything is going well. In my opinion, the food is also better than the chains. The secret ingredient is love."}

{"input": "I went to this sprint store location to upgrade my iPhone and was helped by a store associate named Gary. He was so helpful with every question I had regarding my new phone because I am technologically unsavy. Needless to say he was so great I wound up purchasing an ipad mini as well. After I left the store I had some difficulty navigating some things on both devices so I called the store to speak to him more then once lol and he was so gracious in helping me over the phone and so patient with me. I would definitely recommend asking for Gary when you visit this store he was absolutely awesome."}

Katie did my hair in an updo for a wedding in June, and it was awesome. My hair has seriously never looked so good. Katerina is great for nails and make up. All the staff listens carefully to you about the color or style you want BEFORE they embark on the process, and they produce results accurate to what you're looking for. Meredith is the Operations Manager and is helpful booking appointments efficiently and as soon as possible. Sometimes I've called and just said \"I NEED a manicure, help!\" and they've fit me in that same afternoon."}
{"input": "Great spot to get caffeinated. Minimalist interior and a paired down menu let's you know the focus here is on the coffee. Helpful staff and a great product makes this a great stop for a drink in St Pete"}
{"input": "We visited this place because of its location on the wharf, and because my husband loves seafood. It's tiny, but we were there on a Tuesday evening, and only had to wait a few minutes. We ended up sitting at the bar; it would have been a longer wait for a table outside, since there are so few. Because of its size, it's a little noisy, but not bad. The service was very good. My husband had the crab sandwich, and wasn't impressed. It's served on very uninspiring white bread. I had the fried shrimp, and enjoyed it very much; it was not greasy or heavy, and the shrimp was moist and tasty. There is literally nothing but shellfish on the menu. So, the non-seafood enthusiast (me) was happily surprised to enjoy the shrimp so much (plus good onion rings), but the seafood enthusiast (my husband) didn't love the crab sandwich. If we tried this place again, he would order something else. The location is awesome, so if you like shellfish, definitely give this place a try."}
{"input": "Went there last New Years Eve with my co-workers. Real quick review.. it's the same Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. I don't really feel wow-ed or disappointed by it. We ordered bunch of stuffs and ate it together as a group. No personal experience whatsoever. Thus the A-OK rating so far.\n\nBut we did have a good time there -even though I believe that it's partly because of the influence from one of my friend's wife; she spoke Chinese fluently.. so it made things easier haha.\n\nThe food arrived very late though. We were feed peanuts for close to one hour - and for a moment I almost believed that we were either monkeys or elephants."}
{"input": "We stopped here for my Chai and Hubby's coffee and caffeine mania. The line went quite fast, they're quick with the service especially not a lot of people at the time. My Chai came out good, awesome! One thing I forgot to do is to purchase more coffee for the house. They have lots for sale. But not too worry because we still have plenty of Starbucks coffee at home. What would life be without Starbucks?"}
{"input": "I gave the Philly location of this chain a chance for dinner.  Service was a little slow (we had a lot of waitstaff milling around us, but no one took care of us unless directly asked), but larger portions were worth waiting for - 3 entrees dishes would have been more than enough for the 4 of us.  \n\nI tried the Indian Mee Goreng with beef substituted for shrimp and enjoyed the wok-y flavor and the super-tender beef. Get a table near the kitchen to see one guy swing dough around his head endlessly to make the thin, light Roti bread (which is a pretty good appetizer option)."}
{"input": "Great location and a great staff."}
{"input": "15 microbrew taps, order food, pretty nice little bar but the Wi-Fi is so so slow slow slow. I love whole foods and have been to most of them in the western United States, it's a good bar but not a good value---come on, growlers $20 to $40????"}
{"input": "I just got home from Rescue and felt I had to post a review. I had a manicure and pedicure with Sally and let me tell you...she is a real professional. Her attention to my nails (trimming, filing, nipping, and polishing) is second to none. She carefully shapes my nails just the way I like them and is cautious not to over-buff. My polish stays on until she takes it off the next week (which considering what I put my nails through is unbelievable). I know I just shot myself in my beautifully pedicured  foot, as I will never be able to get in with her again. Going to Rescue is not just about getting services done, it is an experience in its' self.  There are pros and cons in every spa but the fact is Rescue Rittenhouse Spa is for people who are serious about having the best there is."}
{"input": "A little pricey.  But very good.  The food is pretty spicy.   I would suggest the dan dan and the fish casserole."}
{"input": "I'm addicted to this place! Fantastic, fresh & delicious Mexican food.  It's also cheap. Great quality. Yummy guac!"}
{"input": "The reviews were mixed but we had to give it a try just for the atmosphere. The views are beautiful and we did make a complete 360 turn while dining. The service was efficient, attentive and professional. Very large drink menu and typical beer options. The prices are very high and it is clear that you are paying for the ambiance. Our ceasar salad was phenomenal,the bread sticks were fresh, and the clam chowder was also great. \n\nMy husband ordered the filet mignon with crab meat and it was cooked exactly as requested; rare. The fresh veggies and mashed potatoes were all very good as well. We wouldn't say it was the best steak ever but definitely worth a try if you're going to eat here. I ordered the shrimp Alfredo. It came with a lot of large shrimp which was great, but the Alfredo sauce was very bland. I suggest going for appetizers, drinks and desserts. Although we didn't try dessert, the display was beautiful. All in all, worth a try at least once."}
{"input": "On a recent trip to New Orleans I realized I left my dress shirt at home. My suit wouldn't have looked good with the one clean Roots Canada T-shirt I had left, so I headed off to Perlis to find myself a white button-down for dinner at Commander's Palace.\n\nPerlis was everything a proper men's clothing store should be. A gentleman in an impeccable suit helped me find the perfect French cuff American-made shirt. When I mentioned my dilemma, he had their in-house seamstress steam and press the shirt for me at no charge.\n\nHelping me find the perfect shirt would be enough reason to go back, but going above and beyond to really save the day makes me want to wax poetic about this place."}
{"input": "Initially a great place.  Now service is slower, customer service is average, food more rushed at the expense of taste.  Too inconsistent and prices have gone up while service has gone down."}
{"input": "This place is the best, it's fantastic. 1$ beer on Thursdays which is seriously the best price in Tucson. I love guerro but this place has way better salsa bar. My friend kinda got screwed by this place because she eats only kosher, she ordered the fish and they gave her shrimp in her tacos. But as long you're not kosher, the shrimp is great."}
{"input": "the experience here trumps it all. we celebrated our daughter's birthday on a tuesday evening and were the only people there for a while. the owner/waiter/server was fantastic in explaining the process which really impressed us. $5 cocktails and our 6-course dinner for 3, including soda, 2 cocktails and tea topped the bill at just $100 and that's including the tip. \n\nyes, it is everything that everyone raves about.\n\nwhy not 5 stars? well...the food was good, but not like great.\n\nwe will definitely go back!"}

{"input": "When I was with Charter 10 years ago their service was intermittent and customer service was horrendous. I've been a happy customer of AT&T DSL for the last eight years, but was repeatedly approached by Charter stating that they are now the best in the country, their whole network was revamped and that they now have zero issues. I signed up with Charter as of August 1 and the last 4 days were horrendous. The initial tech who was setting up the service was entirely incompetent and was asking ME questions about the router and the modem. The connection was lightning fast for about 2 days. As of yesterday the signal became weak, pages are taking 30-45 seconds to load and sometimes there is no connection at all. I called Charter and spent 15 minutes on hold, then talked to someone who hung up on me and was finally able to schedule a technician to bring a \"signal booster\" to my place. I live in Central St. Louis, not in a rural area, so apparently their \"best in the nation\" network still leaves much to be desired."}
{"input": "I love this place. It's been in La Cumbre Plaza for I don't know how long now. If you are looking for a good sandwich look no further. All of the ingredients taste fresh, and their bread rolls are amazing. They are nice and soft, not with that cut the roof of your mouth crust. Being born and raise in Santa Barbara, actually just down the street, I have been coming here for some years now. I've tried probably over half of their sandwiches and all have been good, so good it's hard to pick a favorite.  In addition, I cannot forget to mention their awesome soda selection, so awesome I cannot hesitate to try something different with every visit. You won't find anything super fancy or exotic, like a roasted duck pastrami sandwich here, but if you're a local or just passing through and feel like having a great sandwich with good fresh ingredients swing by Plaza Deli and grab a bite."}
{"input": "Food was great, service was not. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt it was an anomaly but it wasn't  busy and no one was very friendly and my order was wrong. Having said that, the coffee was great and the hash was really good--fresh, tasty, and nice portion."}

{"input": "I have been going to this dive bar for years. Jonny's has a great happy hour everyday and it's very laid back. The food is always on point though. You may think that a dive like this wouldn't have the best options but you are wrong my friend. They make all of their dough from scratch and their naked wings keep me coming back every time. Their Jon's salad with grilled chicken is also a staple of mine along with their pizza.\nThey also offer games such as trivia and even bingo. They are all free to play and you win some great stuff like gift certificates and even 1 cent pitchers of beer! Can't go wrong with that. \nIt is a smoking bar so be aware of that and it gets pretty bad when they are busy. It does get  crowded on game days or nights. Overall it's a great place to grab a few cheap beers with friends and a half-price pizza (did I mention they have 1/2 off pizza on certain days?)"}
{"input": "I've been here several times just cause I live in the area. Its kinda a scam ... or maybe its a joke.  Jackson's serves mediocre bar food at best, thats it.... mediocre at BEST.... and its way over priced for the quality and thought put into the dishes.  The bar is nice & I enjoy sitting outside when the weather is agreeable... but the service is pretty horrid.  If I didnt have previous restaurant experience and know what its like to work for tips, I wouldn't tip at all.  I have had several nights where I have walked in with a GROUP of friends and it has taken twenty plus minutes to get a drink order .... then another thirty minutes to get my dos perros to the table.  \n\nMoral of the story: Jackson's thrives off of there location ... Seriously, there is nothing impressive about there menu.  And there hipster prick servers add the topping on the pretentious asshole cake."}

{"input": "We were heading into Media to take \"back roads\" and get off the congested \"Blue Route\" at rush hour, and knew The quaint downtown had a decent selection of places for drinks. John's just looked like an old school mainstay, so we opted to try it rather than some of the hipster-ish alternatives.  Inside, looks like the y last updated in 1970, wood paneling, old light fixtures - but it had a homey quaint feel.  Huge bar, cheap drinks.  This is definitely a locals place. Menu looked like a reliable list of traditional pub food - though we just enjoyed $2 pints. Media is an upscale town, so I doubt this place could attract the crowds it does unless the food was decent. Don't come here if you want an open-arms welcome or any pleasantries from the bartender. This is pay-as-you-go baby."}

It is clean, the associates are very friendly (greeting me on the way in and on the way out) and the place is full of funny and entertaining signs to read while you eat.  I am sure that this place will stay busy being located right off of I-465 and by many work places.  My only regret...I forgot to get a pickle!"}
{"input": "Best sandwiches Santa Barbara yet so few people know about it. This place is OG as it gets and all the subs are killer and reasonably priced. Love this place."}
{"input": "Absolutely terrible experience. I accidentally booked a wrong night through this hotel and when I called to see if I could a refund and change it they would not allow me. It was a simple mistake and I wanted to change it to another date and they still would not let me do so. Terrible customer experience. I will not be booking with a complete different hotel."}
{"input": "Wonderful experience and amazing food. We sat at the food prep counter and could watch the chefs prepare dishes. It was really cool to watch and they were all very friendly and communicative. We were even greeted with a complimentary tasting when first seated. Loved everything about the experience!"}
{"input": "my wife and I had chosen not to go to this restaurant based upon a visit from a friend. In hindsight it looks like his experience was a one-off. Everything about our visit was great the service the food the waitstaff Danielle in particular. We had all you can eat steamed crabs for $28 how can you go wrong with that? Try it at least once"}
{"input": "I have never been more frightened in my life.  I screamed, fell on the floor, and ran for my life.  I was literally covered in sweat and needed my inhaler multiple times.  The campus is huge and VIP is definitely the move.  Pennhurst is an amazing campus with lots of history and the actors are fully committed to making the experience hair raising.  I would suggest this place to anyone looking for a frighting experience."}
{"input": "The blue version of Razoo, this is a bunch of sweaty tourists who will crowd and probably vomit on you.  Everytime i walk by the place, House of Pain is on:  \"Jump! Jump around! Jump! Jump around!\""}
{"input": "I can understand why this place has a bad rap because of past incidents but honestly if you go into it with an open mind and ready to dance you'll have a blast. The security guards were all very nice and efficient, getting in was super quick (we had a guest list). \nOnly reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the coat check cost 4 bucks which to me is a little ridiculous. \nOver all i was really impressed with the service and atmosphere, and I'll definetly be returning (just without a jacket this time lol)"}
{"input": "Michael and Chris were great! It was easy to book the tour and the Michael took us out on a tour, we saw Dolphins, homes, see life and spent time exploring an island. I can't wait for the next time we visit Clearwater I will certainly take the tour again. Keep in mind that if you are a beginning jet skier let them know so they can put you with other beginners."}
{"input": "Holy pink and sparkles Batman! This place is super decked out in all thing cake bling. Great atmosphere for girls night out based on all the groups in their tonight. Saving grace for men? The cake was delicious. A bit pricy at $12.50/slice, but perfect for a special occasion. My wife and I stopped in for anniversary dessert tonight."}
{"input": "Square 1682 is a hotel bar I frequent. I've been there for lunch, brunch, dinner and happy hour. The food is great, the service is excellent, and the space is upscale. There is always a nice group of people that go there. Whether they are staying at the hotel or live or work in the area, you'll always find someone nice to chat with at the bar. The very best thing about the bar is the bartender that works on Mondays. His name is Dan and he is the man! He's my favorite bartender in the city and I've been to a lot of places. He always knows just what I want and remembers my name when I go there. The only reason I go to Square 1682 on Monday's is because Dan is working. If I walk by and he's not on, I keep going. He's that good! Love him and have so many great memories at this fine establishment."}
{"input": "Deli counter is quick, never lines and if there are they add more people to help. Fresh food, the hours are great and the customer service is good. No complaints here. Never had a problem at Publix."}
{"input": "I've always heard great things about their groothie so I tried it. It was giving me a smoothie-gasm. Love it. But then one time it was served room-temperature and it was awkward...which was off putting to me because I don't really like warm smoothies, though other people may not mind. Personally, I think I pay good money for this, so it bothered me. I came back another day for another try, and I realized I fell in love with the groothie when it's chilled. I've yet to try their other goods! I like the vibe of the place itself though. Lots of positivity :)"}
{"input": "The burgers are \"Diner\" delicious.  Got the app and \nIt gave  me a free milkshake!  Enjoy every visit."}
{"input": "We stopped in and I had the burger and my wife had the cheesesteak.  Both were tasty, I think both agreed that the burger was better.  We also had order of fries, our total was just over $24, a bit pricy for take out lunch.  Maybe the cost is in line with other Rittenhouse eateries, I don't know.  There were only a few tables, so I guess it is a take out joint.  We enjoyed our lunch.\n\nMy wife said they were the BEST sweet potato fries she ever had, and we have eaten these everywhere. If we are downtown again we will try other choices.\n\nThe other comment I have is that everyone (customers) in the store looked like they were between 20 and 30 years old.  And most of them had piercings or tattoos, so I'm thinking healthy eating is trendy?  The store was hopping."}
{"input": "My personal favorite wine and liquor store in Nashville.  The staff is usually very friendly and helpful without being pretentious.  You can ask for a $10 dollar bottle of wine recommendation without being scoffed at.  The selection is good and the prices are comparable with other liquor stores in town.  \n\nOne negative, the curb is a little bit high pulling in.  Don't gun it unless you want to scrape some rust off of the bottom of your car."}
{"input": "Over-promises, and under-delivers. Quoted 12pm delivery and not only was 30 min late but also forgot to bring the soda we ordered. Said it would take 5 minutes to bring the soda and doesn't come back for another 30 minutes. Pizza was lukewarm and no soda. Thanks."}
{"input": "Ya, unfortunately our favorite local theater has officially crashed and burned! Last time we go.... just isn't worth $47 for three adult tickets, then my wife and I have to run the theater too.  I will start with arrival, an irritated bartender, upset customers asking for help, getting eye rolls from employee, then once the movie started, had to tell same irritated bartender to have someone turn off the bright lights in the movie theater, the movie has been running for 5 minutes already, had to change out soda twice, both were flat, with very little syrup.  screen was dark, no surround sound on. All in all, was a great place at one time, now, just drive by, you will be glad you did.  It was obvious no management or any sense of concern for the customer. What a joke!"}
{"input": "I've always liked banana pudding, but the Sweet Life Bakeshop made me a believer! I had a craving for something sweet after visiting the Liberty Bell, so quick yelp search led me here. It's a small bakery with seating for about five, so many people probably get sweets to go and enjoy them in a nearby park.\n\nAll of the banana pudding options looked amazing and I was having a really hard time deciding what to get, but there was a friendly woman working there who patiently described each of the puddings to me. I decided to go with the sundae pudding, which was so tasty! It wasn't overly sweet which was perfect for me. I wish I lived in Philly so I could come here all the time! If you're in the area be sure to stop by! And don't forget to check in on yelp because you get 20% off of your order."}
{"input": "The only reason this is great because of Ben the bartender. Very welcoming. I have been in the business. So I see a worker when I see it. He kept the bar stocked with ice beer and smiles. Very pleasant always smiling. GREAT BARTENDER. I will be back just because of Ben."}
{"input": "I have been here a few times now and have never been disappointed. Everything is pretty delicious. The $5 milkshakes are freaking amazing. I will say that it's a little on the pricey side for what it is, but the food is tasty and the atmosphere is nice. I will definitely be back!"}
{"input": "Banana pudding + salty caramel = deliciousness in a cup! \n\nReal slices of banana. Love the saltiness level of Carmel. It was a great sweet dessert. With a dab of whipped cream."}
{"input": "From the moment we arrived the front desk staff was feiendly and welcomjng. They provided us with information on what to do close by the hotel and provided us recommendations amd tips for our hike at Sabino Canyon. The service throughout our stay was amazing. The Gringo Grill staff was also helpful and friendly. Good food, service, and stay for a great price."}
{"input": "Had lunch here today with my wife!  Service was Fast & the Sandwiches Very, Very Tasty!  Very Good Deli!  Marbled Rye was Fresh & \"Out of Sight\"!!"}
{"input": "We have come here many times, this time we came in around 1pm & the place was packed. I think they were a little under staffed. There was no hostess when we got there because she was to busy cleaning. Olivia was our server & had just transferred from another store but did pretty good. We had mozz sticks, boneless (all you can eat) special & a margarita. All was ok,     We have never really experienced a problem here & it is close to home."}
{"input": "I love this little place.  It's a dive bar full of great staff and customers around the bar.  The menu includes several vegetarian items, as do the daily specials.  The soups are fantastic.\n\nDid I mention that Flanagan's is open 24 hours?  Plus!"}
{"input": "Thank goodness for yelp because we would've never found this place without it. It's a little hole in the wall place very charming. We happened to come on happy hour which was a great bargain we had two drinks and dinner for a little over $20 Great guacamole and simple tacos were just what we needed. Shinon the bartender was helpful and accommodating."}
{"input": "Have been there twice while in town from a coast. The line out the door and the mix of people tells you everything you need to know. It IS that good.  Not that the food is so glorious that you will forever be spoiled, but the combination of quick and efficient service, affordable prices, friendly staff, creative menu, well prepared and thought-out preparation, seemingly fresh ingredients and an authentically pleasant ownership, can be a rarity across this country.  All done without irony, kitsch or pretention. \n\nI sat in awe at the lunch rush and thought \"this place is perfection \"\n\nAll of that and the hot dogs were great too!"}
{"input": "Place is neat and kitchen is good.. Food is tasty.. Not many options for vegetarians though.. Except for cheese quesadilla, vegetables tortas and stuff like that"}
{"input": "I usually love going to this t-mobile. The representatives are always so nice and helpful but today, the girl there gave me nothing but attitude when I asked about the new iPhone. Maybe she was having a bad day or whatever but she should be in a better mood when she talks to her customers."}
{"input": "Awesome cafe!  My friends and I were in town for Mardi Gras in 2011 and stumbled upon this gem while wandering around looking for lunch.  I had the Fleur de Lis Panini and it was delicious.  Also, the bathroom is ridiculously nice; it had a TV playing AMC!"}
{"input": "This is probably my favorite food truck in Tucson as its a great alternative to a taco. They are typically outside Hotel Congress (Sat & Sun nights), Crooked Tooth Brewing and Tap & Bottle. However, last night we had them before the All Souls Procession on the lot across from the Mercado. \n\nI love their corn arepa and have had both the chicken and shredded beef fillings ($7 each) which were very good. We also ordered a side of plantains for $3"}
{"input": "Bought a headlight there the other day and they helped me replace it, too. They made helpful recommendations that saved me money. I would definitely stop there again if necessary! And there car freshners smell amazing!"}
{"input": "Went there on a reservation through Open table. Everything went smooth. I had the chicken rice soup along with the Wild boar meatloaf, mashed potatoes and asparagus. Asparagus were too big, but tasty. Also had a side of brussel sprouts that were excellent! Wife had the grilled chicken. Food and service was very good. BYOB    Just a little noisy. Would recommend."}
{"input": "I am undecided if I like this place or not. I have been a couple of time. However during the storm a couple of weeks ago, me and my BFF ended up here and everything was delicious.  I had fried pickles and the short rib Mac and cheese and have been craving it since. Maybe it was the margaritas but I loved my dinner. The waitress was also so sweet!!"}
{"input": "Love it! Can't get enough of this place. Freshest dead fish in town. Make sure you try one of the chef's special rolls. They usually interesting and quite tasty."}
{"input": "Good food and decent beers. They have TVs at the bar and plenty of seating (at bar and then high-tops and low-top tables as well. Went there on a Sunday night and there were only 6 other people in the whole place. For now, while this place stays a secret, it's nice and quiet: don't know how service is when it is crowded but ours was decent. I got the fish tacos and they were really good. It's located in the strip mall near Dunkin' Donuts so you would never know it was there unless you're looking for it."}
{"input": "My sister and I were visiting Arizona all the way from the east coast and our aunt and uncle brought us for breakfast today. Our server, Alma, was out of this world. She had an amazing, positive, and outgoing personality. From the moment we sat down, we felt at ease and comfortable. Her sense of humor kept us entertained and feeling welcome.  We couldn't asked for a better and more upbeat personality.  She definitely deserves positive accolades from all who work with her.  We can't wait to visit again! On top of this, the food here is phenomenal!"}
{"input": "Every time I go visit my sister in law and family we stop by early early Saturday to get these donuts!  Yummy.....  The best!"}
{"input": "My purse strap broke so I stopped to get it fixed at the closest place I could find. They took it immediately and it was ready within 30 min. It was fixed so well that If I hadn't already known the purse strap broke I wouldn't have been able to tell. I am very happy"}
{"input": "Really good selection of super cute bikinis! Plus good location & lots of parking. They also let me know if they didn't have my size they would order it for me 10% off and free shipping . Definitely will be back"}
{"input": "Alright, so this place is getting a bit of a bad rap and I'm not sure why. \n\nI lived in LA for four years and so far this is the closest I can get to legit street tacos.\n\nIf you want a great lunch, get the stuffed avocafo for an app and street tacos for lunch. Cannot go wrong. \n\nThe service was absolutely fantastic and it's so cheap that I'm not sure what you can really complain about. \n\nSo glad this place exists downtown !"}
{"input": "There's just something different about the seafood here. Located a short cab ride from Downtown Philly, is DiNardo's. A non-descript, red brick building with a wooden sign swaying in the breeze points to the front entrance of this establishment. The huge crab on their sign hints that maybe you should try the crab. The Blue Claw crabs are flown in everyday from the Gulf Coast. Unlike their cousins in the Chesapeake, these Gulf Coast crabs are \"free swimmers\", which means bigger crabs and more meat.\n\nLet's look at their raw bar. Clams on the Half Shell are half dozen freshly shucked ice-cold beauties served atop ice accompanied by cocktail sauce and lemon. These clams are sweet with a scent of the sea.  These are the best clams on the half shell I have ever had. The cocktail sauce is the best cocktail sauce I've ever had, sweet with just the right amount of horseradish. Thumbs up with 5 stars!"}
{"input": "Use the yelp app to get on the waiting list, we went on a Saturday morning and it was very busy, but the waiting list was cut down significantly by using the app. The menu is expansive, a lot of options. The cinnamon French toast was very good. The traditional breakfast foods were on par with most breakfast joints, but the extras on the menu can keep you busy for many visits trying new things. The strawberry orange juice was excellent so I recommend trying it. It was a little hot in the restaurant, could have been cooled down a lot for a more comfortable experience. The service was very good. There were two places to pay at the counter which I thought was a nice way to speed up the leaving process."}
{"input": "Everyone will agree- that I'm a highly judgmental person (usually on the negative side.) So when I come across something that is actually amazing, I think its important to make note. Breaux Mart has amazing King Cakes! Ive had this response from both locals and tourists alike. This location- will make- them for you out of season if you preorder.  And they have all the basic staples that a New Orleanian might need during a pilgrimage between MSY airport and the French Quarter/downtown; i.e., Blue Runner Red Beans, Hubig's pies, and Community Coffee (my normal OMG I need it list). ;)"}
{"input": "Really cute shop with lots of eclectic items.  Very nice proprietors and a very attentive chat de maison.  Makes shopping locally really pleasant."}
{"input": "Terrible service the cashier Danielle kept messing up on the order and getting noticebly irritated. It seemed as though she didn't want to be there at work, I should have known when we walked in there were some unhappy customers in that joint. The bad thing is all the other staff were extremely nice and cool skinny guy in the back cooking and big guy manager. Get a different job if you don't like what your doing Danielle!"}
{"input": "Great sandwiches and service fast and friendly service. Had the spicy Philly- flavorful and fresh ingredients."}
{"input": "They guy behind the counter is not friendly or trustworthy, I had a feeling that they were trying to rip me off. I should haver read the reviews on yelp before going there. You would be better off going somewhere else."}
{"input": "Not happy at all. We had been waiting outside while it's cold and raining for about 10 minutes when A group of \"regular customers\"  walk up and go get a table before everyone else that was waiting. Those \"regulars\" were out side bragging about how they didn't have to wait like everyone else. Forget the fact that I'm pregnant, I have two children with me. There were four groups of other people ahead of them. The young guy who calls people in lied to our faces when I asked why they were seated before the one that had been waiting for awhile. I physically saw them pull up in there vehicle and walk up. So I know for a fact they were not here before us. Thanks to them not only my family but other families with very small children had to wait an extra ten minutes. This will be our first and last time here. I do not recommend coming here if everyone it's treated fairly. Very poor customer service!!!!"}
{"input": "My go-to breakfast place. The portions are great. I love the skillets and my bf is obsessed with the biscuits and gravy, he says they are the best he's ever had. My only criticism is sometimes the coffee tastes like it's been out for a while."}
{"input": "We get high on the beauty of this amazing high desert oasis! Nature's drama in the Catalina Mountains. We come here to run or hike. We're #MCLifeTucson - we love it in the canyon!"}
{"input": "ate there a week ago Sunday lunch...great service...a-ok/good baked chicken, bagette, side salad, corn muffin, & bloody mary.  Decor is vintage 70's/80's but nice enough and very clean."}
{"input": "This shop gave me an honest estimate to replace only the parts that were needed on my older car.  Another place had wanted to do alot more work than was needed (for alot more money of course)."}
{"input": "Had the brisket sandwich with two sides and a drink for 9.99 - Great barbecue at an affordable price. Wonderful side such as potato casserole cream spinach baked beans green beans"}
{"input": "To update, the business owner has been in contact and has apologized and made up for it. Overall the Bareburger experience in Center City does have potential to be a good restaurant to check out."}
{"input": "My daughter had our seats within seconds of arriving. The color selection was great and the staff was super happy to see us again. However the amount of pressure I received to get a nicer, more expensive pedicure than the one I had picked for myself and my daughter was intense. I had to defend my decision and it was a bit awkward. I think next time we'll go somewhere else. Too bad, I do like it here but not worth the guilt trip!"}
{"input": "Henry was a rock star  getting us into a storage locker. He was knowledge, professional, courteous and extremely personable. They were gracious to our four legged girl \"Marley\" who had to check them out, too.\nGreat experience in obtaining a storage locker!\nWe recommend!!!"}
{"input": "I never ever post reviews but this place definitely wowed me. The ac in my car was out and after being priced from other competitors in the 1300-1800 dollar range i came to midas. Not only did the fix it for about 500 bucks cheaper, but they refused to let me take a taxi and one of the mechanics gave me a ride home while I wait for the work to be done. The manager Blake was very professional and helpful. Not once did i feel he was trying to upcharge me for maintenance i didn't need. Someone from corporate needs to give this man a raise so he stays in the company for a very long time!"}
{"input": "Apparently they make a point to come tell me that I am parked in  one of the take out spots and that I have to move. They have no open parking so I obliged and drove and parked around the corner. Sitting here inside and having ordered I notice that there are STILL two other cars parked in takeout spots and have not moved nor are they looking to the patrons who own them to ask them to move.  Boy- do I feel special.  I'm skipping this place next time."}
{"input": "You could not find a more beautiful setting for yoga and dance and the instructors are all terrific"}
{"input": "I really enjoy the Crit it's a great family event if you get bored with one spot there's plenty of other places to move around to."}
{"input": "Stopped in here with my wife and a friend for lunch today. And let me tell you it will probably be the last time I visit this location.  I normally love QDOBA but this location down right sucks. From the ride ass customer service to the cleanliness it's just all around terrible. I've never had a person whistle at me from behind a \"line\" and say \"excuse me what would you like to eat\". You're kidding me right?\n\nAnd plus look at my pics, this chick had her hair dangling down in front of her face and swaying back in forth and prepping food. ARE YOU SERIOUS? What happened to having it covered up? I won't be back to this location, to easy to get sick or catch something."}
{"input": "My family has been customers of George's for years. You pay for what you get. The quality of the food is premier and they don't hold back on portion size. Their cheesesteaks are amazing (chopped steak) and their chicken cheesesteaks are made from the same chicken as their Char platters, which is legit. Their Char platters come with some of the best and juciest grilled chicken I've ever had. They make their own sauce, so just that alone puts their wings above the other restaurants in the neighborhood that just use Franks Red Hot. I have yet to have something on their menu that I didn't like."}
{"input": "I do not get the Surrey's hype at all. It was an incredibly mediocre meal. \n\nWe were told a 40-minute wait around 10:45 on a Friday morning. We waited over an hour (aren't hosts supposed to overestimate wait times, not under?).\n\nThe wait wasn't worth it. For a place that boasts about their homemade breads, it's shocking they don't have better than smuckers jelly packets to pair with their baked goods. The shrimp and grits was good but not great, and the bread served with it was legitimately bad. Dry, crusty, literally just stale slices adorning the plate. My partner got a breakfast burrito - it was meh, nothing special.\n\nI got a juice given their namesake and it tasted like concentrate!!!! It was a special, orange-pineapple-mango. I would not get a juice unless you're looking for a glass of sugar.\n\nBad. Skip. Go to Willa Jean's for a far superior/tastier breakfast experience."}
{"input": "What can I say, this is the train station.  The bathrooms are clean, it is a huge space, and there are plenty of little places to grab a snack or a beverage.  It is way better than Penn Station in New York City!"}
{"input": "This is my all time favorite boutique in Nashville.  I always find the one of a kind shoes and deals!   Ask for John Bowyer if you visit the store, he is very patient and helpful."}
{"input": "Terrible seating experience. We walked into the restaurant. Half the tables were empty (not exaggerating, I counted). The host said \"we are too busy, 35 minute wait\". We put our name down for optionality, and not 7 minutes later we were texted that our table was ready. We arrived at the restaurant and were made to wait another 10 minutes because the host was \"busy\"."}
{"input": "I had no expectations going into this restaurant but left really happy! I made a dinner reservation for 5 because it was Mother's Day weekend and our play started at 730. We were the only people in the restaurant until almost 6 so I don't think my reservation was entirely necessary, but as this is the only time I have ever been I don't know if it's always that dead. Maybe make a reservation to be on the safe side. My fiancé and I had the fries to start and I had the chicken penne and he had steak as entrees. The food was excellent. I honestly can't complain about a single thing. I could eat that penne all day everyday. We were done eating by 6 so we killed the time just drinking and chatting. Our server was attentive and polite and we never felt like we were waiting for her which was great. We had about 10 rum and cokes between the two of us and with an appetizer and entrees our Bill was only $130. I will definitely come back here if we're at the citadel again."}
{"input": "HOLY SMOKES!\n\nactual pumpkin pie mixed in with the frozen custard......are you kidding me? Why hasn't this become a huge sweep the nation treat. \n\nThe best part was the chunks of pie crust. Like finding a diamond inside another diamond. Super yummy."}
{"input": "Yum-O! We spend the day in Tarpon Springs, and headed here around 3:45 for lunch / dinner. We waited for about 10 minutes for our table and were seated. \n\nThis restaurant has a TON of staff and they are always running around. Our waiter was nice and quick.\n\nWe ordred:\nGyro - yum\nChicken Slouvaki - yum\nSpanokopita - YES (this is what I ordered, good, but the top filo dough crust was a bit harder than I like)\nHotdog (this is what the 5 year old got)\n\nWe also got an order of the cheese, opa!\n\nYes, this will be our go to spot when we visit Tarpon Springs."}
{"input": "Locals recommended Milktooth, and it's an amazing jewel of Indianapolis. I'm glade I had the chance to experience this."}
{"input": "Venue: loved the ambience (I love old where house renovation) definitely a solid place to watch us #1 ZONA cats dominate other teams.  Huge tvs! [Although the bartender was rude when the signal went out for the game and a gracious tall patron wanted to help.]\n\nBeer and food: I got the stout and it was alright---I know these guys brew for gentle bens and really haven't been a fan of those brews there.  I got the hot habenero wings and it was a nice burn not painful.  Burgers seem solid and filling too \n\nWill be back to watch more games!"}
{"input": "Maryann and the ladies inside Rhapsody Salon cater to a wide range of customers. \n\nMy stylist, Kim Delong, and I have been friends for twenty years. She's been my stylist for six of those twenty. Kim is beyond efficient, sometimes TOO efficient for her own good.\n\nHer hours vary, at the same time, she'll take on two, sometimes three clients at a time, JUST to get things done. Kim is one of THE hardest working stylists in Northern Nevada.  She's an MVP candidate for any salon. I'm glad she's here. \n\nHair isn't the only thing done here. There's an esthetician, and a few women who do nails as well. \n\nIf you're looking for a change of scenery or just want to see if Kim is a better styilst than the one you're currently seeing, make an appointment today at 775-827-2888.\n\nIf you go by this referral, please tell Kim I sent you. She'd love to know there's a viral response flying around."}
{"input": "You think Value City, you think cheap value, right? Wrong! \n\nThink Rothman prices with Ashley Furniture pieces. Not a Broyhill in sight. \n\nNegatives:\n- Entertainment centers and TV stand selection is small, and over priced selection.\n-Their \"Clearance\" section is laughable and not much of a sale. No one is going to pay $299 for a nicked up coffee table that was originally $350. Go lower. \n- Sectionals by themselves average around $1,000 by brands I've never heard of. \n- The staff hangs out like a clique chatting in the middle of the store rather than helping customers. \n-Dining sets are nothing special and overpriced as well. I've seen the same selection everywhere else at a lower price. \n-5% military discount? Ooooh you're going to knock $20 off my sofa! \n\nOnly Positive:\n-They have a few modern pieces. \n\nOverall:\n\nI think they're high for low quality-mediocre furniture. Shop around town. Or if you do find something you must have here, wait for a holiday sale."}
{"input": "After perusing their menu for vegetarian goodies I decided to come here when I saw on their menu a Garden Sloppy Joe.  This vegetarian alternative was pretty good for a brewpub type of place.  There are many items on their menu that have the Vegetarian V next to it which means that I'll need to stop in again during my 2 week stay.  The waitress was friendly and helpful with my veggie questions."}
{"input": "TJ's Shoe Repair is one of the few shoe repair shops right in the heart of downtown Nashville.  TJ's is on Church Street right across from the Library. This place is really great because you can stop in on your lunch hour and get your heels replace on your pumps or get something else patched up fairly quickly.  If you need some more extensive reconstruction you may have to drop your shoes off, but this place is great for a quick repair.  \n\nSo, if you broke your heel on the way to work, stop in at TJ's and they will get you taken care of."}
{"input": "Used to be called the Hamburger Habit and they have chili fries at the Goleta location since it's the original location. I love, love, love to take the family and get a burger with grilled onions, onion rings, and a chocolate malt. This restaurant brings back childhood memories since I grew up in The Goodland. I'm glad this is now a chain so I can eat at this restaurant when I travel California!"}
{"input": "Loved the comfy couches. Coffee and chai were good. Out of the 3 baristas working here, two were really friendly, and one seemed a bit pissed to be here, not sure why.\nAnyhow. I waited here a few hours until my car was being worked on.\nThe atmosphere was great.\nGetting 4 instead of 5 stars bc it wasn't spotless, and the coffee / tea wasn't mind blowingly amazing but I would recommend bc of the comfy couches, free wifi and atmosphere!"}
{"input": "I just went here for the first time. The chocolate vanilla oreo cupcake actually brought tears to my eyes. Tears of joy. It actually brought me back to tasting chocolate for the very first time as a child. Simply the best cupcake of any kind I have had in any city or country I have traveled to. I can't even imagine an entire cake that tasted like this wow just WOW. If every cupcake on Earth tasted like these there would be World Peace. And gluten free? Who would've thought it was possible? And guys forget the flowers dude. If you're in the dog house get your lady some of these cupcakes and you'll be in the clear. lol"}
{"input": "This is hands down THE best Thai Restaurant in the area and quite frankly,  anywhere.  The food is delicious and has become our go-to comfort food. Try the Red Curry and Drunken Noodles.  By far the tastiest anywhere!  The owners and staff are so kind and friendly and make everyone feel like family. I'd give them 10 stars if I could!"}
{"input": "The buffet had a lot of food, with crab legs, prime rib, roast pork, shrimp, calamari, and steak as the main meat items. It has a selection from various cuisines, Chinese, Mexican and Indian. They kept all the areas well stocked with food.\n\nThe meat was not bad and also liked the roasted vegetables. The rest of the food was at best okay, the salad bar's vegetables and fruit were pretty sad looking. The fruits were rather disappointing, with only pineapple and Cantaloupe.\n\nThe dessert selection had cakes, gelato, creme brûlée and pies. I liked the gelato a lot, while the cakes and brûlée a were extremely sweet. \n\nFor the $30 (post tax) on a Saturday night, it's not a bad value, but nothing amazing."}
{"input": "by far the WORST effort at chain mexican food. I thought this was a sister restaurant of the The Lime ( now called the Green Lemon)  and gave it a shot.  Terrible food. My wife gave me a bit of her guacamole and it tasted like water mush. one their smoky salsas tasted metallic.   DO NOT GO!!!"}
{"input": "Great pizza, first off. Can't go wrong with the cheese steaks and the onion rings are nothing to laugh at. I get stuck on those things, but i want to order more! Delivery is good and timely, and the food is always nice."}
{"input": "Had a great breakfast this morning. Met the manager Nick. Great guy. Loved the fact that he took time to go out of his way to talk to me and ask how my dining experience was. Great spot for the locals as well as the tourists. I had the Big Easy breakfast. Enough food for two. The pancakes were excellent. Good fast service, good food and overall good experience."}
{"input": "The hotel is clean and the staff very friendly and helpful. The room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. The only negative I could find is  the lack of an elevator in the parking garage and no wifi."}
{"input": "Just a little follow-up.  The Mrs. and I ate there last Friday night, and the live entertainment was really good considering the tiny space they had to squeeze into.  We ran into some people we know in the music biz, and she agreed the guitar player was terrific.  \n\nThe food was great once again, although I must admit I always order the same exact thing."}
{"input": "The girls behind the counter are so delightful and nice. Treat you nicer than your family!\nHelp you get what you like! I also got a grilled cheese. It's nice to try the local delights. \n\nStevie Nicks playing overhead. \n\nMy grilled cheese is a work of art. I'm already excited af. The cheese was real not velveeta. Very very beautiful and comforting. It came with sea salted potato chips. \nThe ice tea was made fresh. The taste is refreshing & exceedingly delish. \n\nFree WiFi too... so you can Yelp!"}
{"input": "Wasn't impressed. My friend got a terrible tattoo there.Maybe that's why its so far away from town.vape and tattoo? I hear vaping is not allowed in tattoo shops. Hack artists trying to pretend tattoo."}
{"input": "This is our \"go to\" place! The food is consistently good and we always have friendly attentive waiters to sometimes help with our decisions. One of our favorites is the pasta pockets with pear filling. Really delicious! It's also byob which is always a plus. This is a great restaurant with a real cozy, family atmosphere. Highly recommend."}
{"input": "Becca is an awesome bartender. They have awesome happy hour specials including land shark. The food menu is somewhat limited but the service at the bar is great. We hope they can keep up the business and attract more locals."}
{"input": "We were visiting Philly for the weekend a some friends recommended HipCityVeg. We picked up dinner for the kids and everything was delicious. And the staff was wonderful! Highly recommended and hope to be back soon."}
{"input": "I live near here so location is a big part of why I stopped in my first time.  I'm not much of a soccer fan, or an \"English Pub\" type person, so normally I would have looked it over.  However I was pleasantly surprised when a friend and I had lunch there.  The food is really good!  I had a BLT - made with rasher bacon on a baguette, it is a substantial sandwich, and the homemade potato chips were great.  With a beer menu that would make even the most pretentious beer snob happy, you really can't go wrong for a nice leisurely afternoon lunch.  The patio out back is nice, too.\nI can't say how it is late night - although it is packed every time I walk past it!"}
{"input": "This place was extremely good, definitely one of the best ramen places I've been to. There was plenty of food and the rice beer was good. There was a line but it moved quickly and they let you look at the menu while in line so the service was quick. \n\nThey should look into getting hot sake for sale bombs though."}
{"input": "I usually stay away from restaurants on piers since most are tourist traps but went to this one since it had so many good reviews.\nCalm chowder had good pieces of clam but the soup was pretty thick - it is ok, not as good as some reviews here claim.  Crab cakes were also ok.  The shrimp and scallops pasta was awful - small shrimps and scallops, definitely not fresh.  It was also sour, either from some wrong ingredient or some overdue sauce."}
{"input": "They charge $2 more for tomato mozzarella sandwich then the regular stand-alone Starbucks do."}
{"input": "I'm a Sizzling Wok regular. I work nearby and stop in for lunch often. This is by far the best Asian food in Indy. Everything I've had is delicious. The pho is a favorite of mine. I also love the pork in a clay pot. But even their friend rice is way better than any other fried rice I've had. The owners are awesome and nice as can be. They make great suggestions if you're not sure what you're in the mood for."}
{"input": "Great friendly and fast service, solid pizza, huge and delicious Greek salad, cheesy garlic bread, homemade rice pudding"}
{"input": "This place gets one star they need to replace the whole staff me and my friends have labeled this place as super ghetto, some servers are nice I guess but there's no structure, management doesn't know how to compensate for horrible service, I've been to other applebees and it was not like this, I would suggest new management. And If you're looking for even a little bit of class don't come here."}
{"input": "they started serving breakfast, and its a good deal: two eggs, two bacon, two sausage, and hashbrowns for about five bucks. not bad. the food isnt the greatest, but its reasonably priced--especially the breakfast. the burgers are mediocre and the mexican food isnt too great, but its a dependable place."}
{"input": "Yep, that cinnamon bread is a winner.  I'll order it as my brunch entree next time around.  The mimosa with lavender was also darn tasty!  The frittata I ordered was lacking (not very large, sunken, and way too hot for most of the meal) but my hubby's bacon and fried egg on pretzel bun with bacon jam was to die for.  They sell their bacon jam and, my goodness, how I'd recommend it!"}
{"input": "I love food trucks that bring something different to the table. And the \"Twisted Iron\" brings it!!! I order the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger Waffle Burger with a side of waffle fries and i must say it was well worth it!!! The burger was cooked to perfection and the fries were nice and crispy. I cant wait to come back and try there chicken and waffles."}
{"input": "I dig this place because I feel so far from STL when I'm here!  It's smokey and loud and tons of great stuff on the walls.  I love bars like this that don't look like they're trying too hard.  It's a place where people outside boring Midwest norm can be comfortable!  Looking forward to coming back soon"}
{"input": "Epicurious M. said it best, \"Best AYCE sushi and top notch Chinese food in Reno.\"\n\nI can't argue with this statement.\n\nMy friend Jill Gianoli introduced me to the wonders that rest behind these doors, and I've been hooked ever since. The selection is impeccable, the quality is superb, and for what they offer, I'm not afraid to pay an extra buck or two.\n\nI'd be lying if I didn't say that this spot is in my top 3 places in town for sushi."}
{"input": "Very liberal portions for some dishes, scanty for others that are the same price. \n\nNice branding \nDecent number of options \nSeveral fancy coffee-type drinks \nNice if you have a sweet-tooth, there's a lot of gelato and sweet crepe options.\n\nMaybe 1:2 or 2:3 savory to sweet options."}
{"input": "I didn't really like my sandwich I got here. I got the jalapeño cheese bread and it was tasteless and dry. I could tell it was old. Also I got tomatoes and cucumbers which were mush because they were overripe. Usually they're a lot better than this but today wasn't it. The staff is very friendly though."}
{"input": "The only place in Tucson I let wax my eyebrows! I always go to Jennifer and she is amazing. She selects an eyebrow shape that is most complimentary to your face using different stencils. Then she carefully sculpts them using hard wax, not strips. This is so much better for your skin! They do an absolutely amazing job, and for only $20!"}
{"input": "One of my favorite restaurants in port Richmond/fishtown... Food is always good and service is excellent. The owner Frank is a very good guy and so friendly!! It's a small BYOB which I always love. I have been going there since they opened I believe it's about 2 or 3 years now!! From girls nights to dinner dates, I always pick to go there!!!"}
{"input": "Always excellent service and amazing food. The staff is is always friendly and there are many promotions that always keep us coming back. The quality of the fish is amazing and the perfect portion size of the rolls allows you to try many different kinds. Out favorite sushi in town!"}
{"input": "A lovely spot for a nice dinner. We had delicious Pacific Northwest oysters that made me smile and the risotto was rich without being overly decadent. The service was very friendly and sweet. My only wish is for a more varied wine list."}
{"input": "This was delicious bar b que! The meats were fantastic- you barely needed any sauce! The brisket and smoked sausage were my favorite, but the boudin and pulled pork were fantastic too. The sides were just as good- the Mac and cheese and black eyes peas were out of this world delicious. The service was prompt and friendly. I am already planning what I will get the next visit!"}
{"input": "My daughter needed her wisdom teeth out.  Dr. Gomez was so engaging and put her right at ease.  He has a great bedside manner and she was not  the least bit nervous."}
{"input": "no contest best Chinese good in the area. owners are incredibly nice and the wontons while you wait for take out are a treat."}
{"input": "I've been here a few times and it's a really good sushi spot  \nThe buffet is OK and I'd recommend sitting at the bar for the best service.\nNot the best place for kids unless they really like sushi"}
{"input": "Dr. Todd is the best! I started going here about three months ago and I have noticed such a big difference. \n\nI had broken my back in two places and have suffered from back pain for years. After seeing Dr. Todd I have noticed a difference in my flexibility and have not had the aching pain that I have dealt with on a daily basis. Dr. Todd is super friendly and truly listens to what is going on with YOU! \n\nHe is very flexible with scheduling and their prices are so reasonable. I have recommended him to many friends and family. He has truly made a big difference in my life and I am grateful!!!"}
{"input": "Two words, ladies (and certain gents): shellac nails. Stop whatever you've been doing with regular polish, the future is all about shellac. No chipping, no drying time, no trouble. \nHere is the good news - not only does Sophie's do shellac polish, they do one of the best mani/pedi jobs I have ever had. The do such a fantastic job, I have stopped splurging on a \"$75 special occasion pedi\" at my regular place because Sophie's does such a great job.\nGo, relax and give in to the special experience of Sophies.\nSide notes: I found the salon very clean and the nail team very attentive. They offered me a beverage (when have you ever experienced that at your local nail salon?) and at on point, I had two technicians working on me at one time. So luxurious."}
{"input": "The food Liaison is the perfect addition to an already great town! I love to grab a few items for lunch or even plan ahead and grab some soup and a few salads for dinner. It's open from 11-3 only but call ahead and they'll hook you up with what you want! The Orzo salad is so delicious and the Prosciutto/Fig Tartine is outstanding. The soups are incredible as well. All the selections I've had are very flavorful and have been thoughtfully created to compliment one another. Get yourself there and check it!!"}
{"input": "nice neighborhood bar with smoking; very secure with locked front door and uniformed at the door."}
{"input": "The ONLY place I will ever go for my hair needs. Every single person has always done a great job and the place is adorable. They are awesome and never disappoint!!"}
{"input": "I've used Merrigans several times for work on both a 2012 RV and a vintage 1984 Dolphin. They aren't the best at always answering the phones or calling back but they are the best at fixing what's wrong at a fair price. Your patience will be rewarded with a quality repair at a fair price. It's an honest mom and pop shop that has an eclectic collection of parts for older RV's along with the know-how and experience to fix anything. Definitely the place in Tucson where you won't get ripped off for work on your RV. If you want it done right and still have money left in your travel fund, go to Merrigans. They also have a FREE 24 hr. dump station WITH water."}
{"input": "good value for the price because of it's location. Didn't need to take a taxi at all in French Quarter. The hotel is SAFE and the workers are friendly. I'm reading here that people are complaining about smell? Personally  I didn't smell a thing. Our room was nice and clean, good view of the city. \nMy only complaint is that we were over charged for our stay and it took them a long time for refund it. If you call their front desk they will send you to five different people who can't help you. MY ADVISE -  just speak to the manager of the hotel or call the holiday inn customer service to get things done quicker. \n\nBesides that, our accommodations were A - OK nothing special but nothing bad."}
{"input": "My business, my parents, my ex-husband, my son and myself have accounts with this credit union. We have been with them for about 4 years and have been quite satisfied. With this many accounts and this many people there have been some errors however we go directly to the branch to have them corrected. So far that has worked out great for us."}
{"input": "Southwest has this tolerable habit of arriving early here in Tucson. Bag was waiting for me on the Carosel, too."}
{"input": "Lovely place in a fun neighborhood!  Great burger and fries served with a smile!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"input": "My husband and I went here with a couple of friends one night while they were in town. They really wanted to have some Korean food before going back home, but the place they wanted to go to was closed. So after searching around, we discovered Seoul Garden.\n\nWe tried several varieties of food, and all were delicious! I had never tried Korean food before, so it was quite an experience and a fun change of pace. It was also fun to see that they had their television tuned to a Korean music channel...as I am familiar with Korean Pop (or K-Pop), it was fun to listen to. \n\nOnly negative was that we had to wait awhile before anyone came over to take our order...it seemed to be at least 20 minutes before we finally were able to get someone's attention to bring our drinks and put in our food order.\n\nI definitely would love to come back and try more food!"}
{"input": "We luckily stumbled into this taco place in Tuscon and had some of the best tacos, horchata and margueritas ever.  Happy hour prices to boot! 5 tacos for $10?! Delicioso! Gracias!\n\nIf yoi ever happen to come here, make sure to order their out-of-this-world Al Pastor tacos. To wash it all down try their cinnamon horchata!"}
{"input": "I just had an amazing visit with Dr. Biscardi! Her and her staff are very professional and helpful! First time getting contacts! Looking forward to my follow up!"}
{"input": "I and my husband went here for Dinner one day after work. The environment was nice and calm. Dimly lit and not a lot of noise at all. We are vegetarian and ordered Drunken noodles and Red curry along with spring rolls for appetizers. We loved the food. Asked them to make it spicy and it did come out pretty spicy! The service was great. Sicne its closer to work, I will definitely go back."}
{"input": "Cannot say enough nice things about Halo Hair and Heather. She gave me my first cut specifically for curly hair today and I LOVE it. She was really receptive to what I wanted, and honest with me about what would and wouldn't look good.  I knew immediately she was a great stylist for me when she asked me what I usually do with my hair and I said \"basically nothing\" and she responded \"my kind of client!\"  \n\nThe shop itself is super airy and bright, with a great vibe and cool music playing, and the prices were very reasonable, especially for such an awesome cut!  I'll definitely be back."}
{"input": "This review is for Sunday brunch only. The inside of the inn is beautiful and historic, particularly the Library which is where our large group was seated. The service was great. The brunch offerings, however, were not so impressive. At $26pp, a waffle station would have been nice. Or pancakes. If you wanted eggs, you had to wait at the omelet station. A type of breakfast meat other than pork bacon would have been good also, e.g. turkey sausage, turkey bacon. The vodka penne, chicken francaise, potatoes and green beans were all lacking in flavor.  The cookies and other dessert items were not worth the calories or fat content."}
{"input": "Cashier was very rude fat Hispanic girl at the airport location. Very very rude. Half the menu wasn't even available."}
{"input": "The Nook is located in one of those centers one can drive by a million times and never really notice. It is on Vassar very close to the corner of Kietzke.\n\nWe had lunch today and found the place clean and pleasant along with very amiable service.\n\nI had a regular Cheeseburger, Gus requested the breakfast chicken fried steak be made in to a lunch order and this is how it came out. My sister had a patty melt.\n\nGus really enjoyed his meal saying the gravy was quite tasty. My cheeseburger was cooked just as ordered and too was very tasty and sis was thrilled the patty melt came with American cheese as apposed to the usual Swiss and she enjoyed as well. /\n\nVery nice meal at a reasonable cost, cool huh."}
{"input": "Found this place totally by accident. Definitely try Mike's Spicy Beef 'N Cheddar!! My favorite. A+ to everything :)"}
{"input": "Walked in, excited to try the burger and tots. Small place but, 3 tables open. We sat down and were ignored Until mgr came over to ask if our name was on the waiting list, we said we passed the hostess and she didnt asked us for our name for waiting list. He said people were waiting, meanwhile, no visable people in cue to sit! He told us to get up and wait in a corner near the bar! We left! We had just been in a large group who dropped $$$$ on drinks, snacks at the sister restaurant Tinto next door too. Rude!"}
{"input": "Had exceptional service from Kaleigh. She did my post-wedding hair cut and my color treatment. It was my first time ever coloring my hair and I was completely satisfied with the results. I showed Kaleigh just a few Pinterest pictures and she ran away with it. I had very little direction to give her so I was a bit nervous, but she was patient and understanding and explained the process to me every step of the way. I get compliments from everyoneeee on my hair. :) Thus, make an appointment at 19 Blue and ask for Kaleigh. Although I live in Los Angeles, I am thinking about planning a girl's getaway to SB again, just so I can get my hair done at 19 Blue. :D"}
{"input": "I cannot speak highly enough about this place and their amazing coffee. Every single one of the staff are refreshingly friendly and extremely well trained. The coffee is so consistently good and fresh no matter what you buy or who makes it for you, and the atmosphere is comfortable and esthetically pleasing. I love it here and am a customer for life!"}
{"input": "Tourist trap.  Bland & boring food with inattentive waiters.  The fried alligator was pretty decent...but that was it.  Cocktails were expensive and not well-made (or even very strong).  Sauces were bland.\n\nI save 1-star reviews for establishments where rats are dancing on the tables and the waiter spills a drink on you and then cusses you out for being in the way of their projectile liquid...so I'm not going to give this place a 1-star review, because it wasn't *that* bad...but it was pretty close."}
{"input": "A great restaurant with amazing food coupled with creative spirits.  A visit to Jones is a must every time I'm in Philly! I live for the Basket of Chicken and Mac n Cheese."}
{"input": "I ate here for the first time last Friday. I was extremely happy with the experience. There were 4 of us. Drinks: great selection of craft beer and a very interesting cocktail menu. I had a bourbon cocktail called On the Roof and it was very good. They are a little pricey at $8 but it was something different. We had appetizers. The Salmon dip was spicy and sweet and awesome. We also had the calamari and the dipping sauce was excellent. For entrees 2 had the blackened Salmon with a corn compote (delish) and we had the Salmon Fish tacos. Not the best I ever had but still very good for the middle of America. I had the burger if the day. Prepared with roasted peppers and onions on a nice soft bun. They served it with crispy shoestring French fries sprinkled with parm cheese. There were so many things on the menu I wanted to try."}
{"input": "Arrived at 7:50am on the 5th of the month. Parked near the front door. Waited outside in line for it to open. Sat in the waiting room, breastfed and waited for about 40 minutes. I was number 55, but it seemed like they started on number 35. Getting the license went very quickly. The lady that helped me was super nice and loved seeing my baby boy who was with me. Don't forget CASH ONLY."}
{"input": "Came in after attending the Zurich Classic golf tournament. It was a warm and a bit humid so what tastier then a ice cream cone? I lucked out and found a parking space on the street. The interior is quite cute and comfy.\n\nThe selection here is crazy huge but after sampling a couple of unusual flavors I went with the scoop of cookie monster ice cream on a cone. The ice cream hit the spot and I enjoyed it BC it wasn't overly sweet.\n\nCreole Creamery was definitely worth checking out!"}
{"input": "Yes, this is the only sushi place in town. However, it is great when you're craving sushi and don't have time to go somewhere else. The salmon is probably the best fish they have, so we always order salmon. We also love their spicy edamame, tempura, ocean salad, and cabbage salad. Service has always been friendly and quick!"}
{"input": "Great food! The wait was a bit long, and their wait list process is a bit confusing. But other than that it was nice, friendly, and quick service. And the food was fantastic."}
{"input": "The staff makes this place great. Chris and Emily were so helpful, fun and talented at making delicious cocktails that we came back twice in the same day! Thanks guys! You made the experience."}
{"input": "Red Hook is my jam!  This place focuses on their drinks and their extensive food options. I appreciate this a lot. They aren't pretentious, at all, and have a chill funky homey vibe about then. The people there are pretty friendly and welcoming. I had solid drinks from Red Hook. But if you are looking for a coffee shop that can serve good drinks and good food, then Red Hook blows away the competition.  I've been to cafes that serve good drinks, but not good food. This place serves both!"}
{"input": "At the recommendation of Samantha we tried the whipped ricotta with sour dough bread. OMG, so delicious, along with the wings (not very spicy), asparagus & portobello, pizza and various tasting sized brews. A great outing. \nVery attentive service. \nClean venue \nAll around an enjoyable outing."}
{"input": "Catering probably deserves more than two dollar signs ($$) but it is worth the money. Good vegetarian options. Delicious food with gourmet presentation. Entrees, appetizers and sides were all delicious."}
{"input": "This studio has one of the best yoga teachers in Arizona as a primary instructor - Lisa Schrempp.  It is a great studio for those who like a strong, sweaty Ashtanga-inspired practice.  It's a great alternative to the Anusara studios in town, where there's too much talking and not enough practicing.  \nYoga flow has a great Mysore program (with Jois-certified Lisa Schrempp), which is fantastic (that's my personal practice).  The other classes and instructors are all great as well - I would recommend this studio to anyone, at any level.  There are great beginner classes as well."}
{"input": "Had the pulled pork and the fried chicken for lunch on Sunday. Each came with two sides; I got the collard greens and smashed sweet potatoes with the pulled pork and my boyfriend got the fried chicken with green beans and smashed sweet potatoes. The pulled pork, fried chicken, sweet potatoes were great. I can live without the other two sides. Each plate was $9.99 which is not bad for lunch in downtown Franklin. Be warned, it's not a good place for big groups because it's pretty small and the wait for 6 was about 45 mins around 12:45pm. If I had to wait, I wouldn't have."}
{"input": "This is the most poorly designed mall I have ever seen.  You have to cut across parking lots to get from place to place...in either the hot blazing sun or the freezing wind.  Reno officials were completely ripped off by the designers of this \"strip\" mall. For a beautiful example of a great outdoor mall check out The Grove in So Cal.  All parking is on the outside with the stores clustered on the inside. Would not have cost any more for this more efficient design. This mall is ridiculous."}
{"input": "Always a nice experience to come here...We usually take a veg appetizer, the bread and salad along with a pasta entree....Tiramisu as dessert is delicious too...The service could be a little faster though, considering we have visited even when there were very few customers and still had to wait a long time before we could place our order. Will visit again, because the food is amazing, and not expensive either!"}
{"input": "Delicious fresh acai bowl that leaves you satisfied and content.  The acai is a combination of ice cream frozen yogurt texture topped off with granola and fruits. Yummy. A good healthy substitute for an ice cream craving."}
{"input": "Everything was delicious. The egg rolls are one of a kind and food is authentic. I was a repeat customer with a very large order And she even threw in a few extras to show her gratitude.  And very important to me: GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! The staff is always wonderful."}
{"input": "We walked through the whole space without a single \"can I help you\", the products are most certainly not \"more-than-old\", this is a glorified gift shop. Goodwill finds at vintage store prices, but I suppose what else can be expected nearby some of the most expensive vintage shops in Philadelphia. The curation in this one is lacking."}
{"input": "The regular pizza wasn't hot-n-ready we would've needed to wait 15-20min for 1 pizza that's crazy for a place that offers hot-n-ready pizza"}
{"input": "Never had a haircut in Mayfair but have had plenty of cuts in NYC (lived there 5 years) and Center City (working here 7 years now) with none comparing to the atrocious one from American Male.  I've paid from $20 to $100 for haircuts and I'll happily pay more for great looking hair but I guarantee it won't be found at American Male at any price they're charging."}
{"input": "I am the one who had the half green tomatoes served on my salad and brought it to the attention of management. The menu listed egg on the salad and there was none. The manager comped my salad and apologized. The table where we were seated was on the corner of the restaurant and I ended up with the sun full in my face. A man seated in a booth behind me was having the same problem. I turned around and sat on the other side of my table but the sun was still shining into the side of my eye and was very uncomfortable. My son's tacos looked wonderful but were served cold so that was not a good experience either. I'm not too sure that we will be going back there again."}
{"input": "Biggest group of Dunkin Donuts idiots I have ever come across in my life!!"}
{"input": "This was mine and my fiancé's first time eating here because it not only just opened up, but I got a coupon for a free pizza, so why not right?\n\nWe weren't blown away with the experience or the pizza, but liked that it was fast and efficient. The staff that made that pizza was very friendly, but the cashier wasn't sharing that same enthusiasm. \n\nWouldn't drive out of my way to go here, but if we are in the neighborhood and feel like some pizza, we may go back."}
{"input": "Great Barber Shop....Perfect area....Excellent service...I recommend William Brown to all my male friends"}
{"input": "I love these guys. Tony is one of big help. Had flat tire and he got it fixed less that what his estimation expectation. \n\nThank you!"}
{"input": "We frequently went to their Brooksville location n loved it.   So happy when I heard they were coming to Z'hills.  I always enjoyed their wings but here for some reason were so soaked n hot sauce they were dripping down my arm.  Hubby enjoyed the dog he had.  Inside is well decorated n fun colorful decor.  Price maybe a little high but, what isn't now a days!!"}
{"input": "Yelp comes through again!  Reasonable prices, huge portions, and amazing flavors!  I got a pulled pork sandwich, baked beans, and fried okra...OMG, yum!!!"}
{"input": "Wow!!!!!!! That's all I can say!!! I'm at a loss for words right now. This is the best diner I have ever been to. Can you say gourmet??? On top of that the bartender Ryan was out of this world!! He made every drink to perfection and was so attentive. And did I not mention that the head chef, mark, made sure all of our food came out to our pleasing? Honestly, come to this place and you will not be disappointed."}
{"input": "Friendly and efficient Service. I (stopped in) ordered a pizza to take out and even though it was their busiest time I only had to wait a bit more than ten minutes. I'll definitely be back. The thin crust pizza was great!"}
{"input": "This place is so scummy. Do not go here. I had an entire purse stolen with car keys, iphones, passport inside and no one working was willing to even look if it was turned in, behind the bar or help me out. They told me \"it happens all the time\". Unfriendly and untrustworthy. Do not waste your time."}
{"input": "Fun, low key place to hang out in old city. They have a decent sized bar downstairs, with a separate dining area that has a lot of tables. There is a small bar and weird mosh-pit esque dancefloor upstairs, but that bar is cash only. Great selection of draft beers. The biggest drawback is that if all the seats at the bar are full, there's not really much room to stand unless you sit in the dining area, but that definitely has a different vibe. I heard the food is really good do I will probably be back to check that out."}
{"input": "Love the Greek salad. Pizza is above average. Service ranges from okay to worst on the face of the planet."}
{"input": "Got a great cut from Victor. A short wait,  good conversation between the staff and clients, a nice big shop. Will definitely be back when in the area."}
{"input": "On May 14 of this year I took my boyfriend and our daughter here for his 34th birthday. And may I say, we had a wonderful experience. The drinks were top notch and the food was something out of this world. Taylor our waitress was Awesome! Every server/waiter/waitress that night was great. We'll definitely keep coming back."}
{"input": "I've been going to Body Cycle for about a year! The instructors are AWESOME, they work hard to know who you are and provide an amazing workout.  I go three times a week and get my ass kicked everytime and I am in the best shape of my life.  The classes are scheduled such that even the busiest of people are able to get to a class."}
{"input": "Despite the previous reviewer, \nI can honestly say that these guys (ATG) are worth going to if you have a problem with your vehicle.\nI honestly think, as a customer that these guys are a 5 star rating - I put 4 stars to prove I wasn't just worker that is writing reviews for their own business, though I put 4, I would rate them a 5.\nThe guys that work here are honest about the price and what it will take to get the job done.\nThough I believe the previous reviewer, I don't think this shop deserves what he relayed. I don't know, I wasn't there, but I honestly would say these guys are amazing at what they do and will impress if you decide to come here. \nIf you are in a hurry and have to get somewhere by the next day, and the job is doable with a days work, they will set aside what their currently doing and work past when their hours say to get the job done. \nBe nice and respectful and they will reward you for doing so. \nCheers!"}
{"input": "Great Food, Great Service. Best fast food restaurant in West Nashville. The store is always clean and the team is friendly."}
{"input": "Burger Up is one of my favorite restaurants in Nashville.  While in college, I visited the one in 12th South pretty often.  Now that I live in Franklin, I go to the one in Cool Springs.  Same great food as 12 south but with more seating and less of a wait, yes please! The burgers are definitely one of my top favorite burgers. I get the one topped with pimento cheese, but I have tried a good bit of them.  All are amazing. The truffle fries are out of this world and their garlic aioli is absolutely delicious. Definitely one of my favorite meals in Nashville.  I even recommended it on my wedding website to guests from out of town to try."}
{"input": "We've been there for Valentine's Day !! \nIt was actually really good, well priced and really nice service !! They Cook in front of us as well ! Awesome experience"}
{"input": "Good sized small venue. Maybe hold about 500-700. Toilets are pretty rough so be careful what you have for dinner before a show. Bar was not overpriced and the drinks were generous."}
{"input": "Terra is a dream to work with. She provided the floral arrangements for my wedding in July 2015 at El Encanto. Terra is extremely professional, kind and you can tell that she is working in an an industry in which she is truly talented. I wish I could get married all over again and have requested Terra to do MORE! Unfortunately we were on such a tight budget that we couldn't afford much but Terra worked so well within our budget and did an excellent job. If I could go back, I would have saved more of our budget towards the flowers because Terra's designs completed our look and provided exactly the right touches we needed. She has so many wonderful accessories as well that I loved and she incorporated in just the right way into our designs! Thank you again Terra, you made our dreams come true!"}
{"input": "Decent drink selections and great food. The staff is friendly and attentive. Ambiance has a bit of a Greek feel, but still somewhat modern. If you want a place to bullshit with your friends, live in u city, and don't want to be around pink haired freaks with lizards on their shoulders. This is where you want to be."}
{"input": "I'm Peruvian, I went to this place a couple times and always it's the same....the pollo a la brasa is always way too dry and never fresh. The green rice is too greasy, I found a lot of oil underneath and it's gross. Other places have so much better food than this. They should check the food before served, like making sure the rice isn't so greasy and that the chicken is served right off the grill, not super dry like it's been sitting around for hours."}
{"input": "Its a hotel and you can stay there.\n\nAfter a couple of stays here I find it is not bad. \n\nIts definitely more of a business traveler kind of place than a tourist kind of place.\n\nPros\nThe rooms have the essentials. The beds are quite comfortable.\nThe cafe isn't bad although it is a little foggy as to what comes with the room. Apparently its one entree and one beverage. Not a bad deal.\n\nCons\nHallways are a bit shaggy. NBD since I am not staying in the hallway.\nRoom cleaning dropped the ball on my last stay. The room was clean, but I found a bag from BK in my mini fridge ... eeeew!"}
{"input": "Unlike any Wawa I have ever seen. Typically they always have beautiful bathrooms and a clean atmosphere. But the bathrooms here are disgusting and everywhere I look seems as though it has not been cleaned in months."}
{"input": "I stopped in for lunch one day after years of, 'I really need to try that place.'  I really like their layout.  They have an uncrowded floor of tables and booths and a lunch counter along one side.  The counter faces the cooks' area, which I like because the bustle of multiple grills, fryers, and prep areas serves as a good distraction, not to mention you get frequent interaction with the staff.  They were busy and getting everything done, but they weren't rude or frazzled, and I had a real sweet waitress.\n\nI ordered the fried shrimp po boy dressed, and asked for a side of rebbeans instead of fries.  I almost had second thoughts on that because the burgers that they were cooking right in front of me looked and smelled so good.  I really have a difficult time resisting the grill.\n\nThe food was average and is what you would expect in a tourist spot in the Quarter.  They may get another star if I go back for one of them burgers."}
{"input": "Decent service, but food was subpar.  Stuff flounder tasted like mush.  Everything else was full of grease and lacking in flavor.  First and last time here....."}
{"input": "Very good. Fast seating. Service was very good but it took awhile for our food to come out. Red beans and rice and crab cakes were amazing."}
{"input": "I can't believe what I paid for a room that had a spa, two televisions, king size bed, a dining area and a living room area for such a low price. I booked online to get the best rate, but it was super cheap. I look forward to coming back again real soon!"}
{"input": "I like the food but they need to give serious consideration about the layout. When we were they we had trouble getting through the shop to get to the desk to check in. Once seated we had to wait at least 30 - 40 minuets for our food to come. After we ate we had an equally hard time to even get out. People coming in, people shopping, and people leaving were all running into each other. Although the staff did their best it was very frustrating. We attempted to do a little shopping and got in line to pay but it took so long we got disgusted and left. Won't be back for awhile."}
{"input": "McMichael's has great food, decent beer selection, and friendly service. I have been here several times, and so far I have enjoyed everything. I especially recommend the Irish Nachos, Garlic Parmesan Chicken Tenders, and Roasted Pork Sandwich (I got it with long hots and sharp provolone). \n\nFor a local pub & grill, McMichael's is as good as it gets."}
{"input": "As usual, Spiro's provided an excellent meal. I had the 16 oz prime rib, perfectly cooked medium rare with a stuffed baked potato and a squash medly, and wife got the gyro salad (not on the menu--just ask for it). This is not fancy dress,  but at least wear a collared shirt. The staff and owner are always very friendly. We have never had a bad meal at Spiro's. While we don't really drink much, the couple next to us, in their 70s and dressed formally, had before - dinner shots, wine throughout appetizers,  entree', and desert, and followed it up with a shot of sambuka (sp.?) afterward). I hope I'm that cool when I'm in my 70s."}
{"input": "My wife and her friends returned to try this place again and her report is that it's worse than before.  The staff is a bunch of inexperienced kids for whom this must be their first job, the food is still crappy (but not microwaved, the owner will tell you that), and the bathrooms and tables are still dirty.  What can you expect from a place that got dinged by the board of health for cooking with camp stoves?  Save your money, the place isn't learning from their mistakes."}
{"input": "There's ice cream and then there is creole creamery ice cream. Made fresh right in the store. It's better than cold stone, baskin robins, or anything else you can buy in a grocery store."}
{"input": "This place blew my mind! My husband and I were craving ramen noodles for weeks and we went there hoping to get some tasty Ramen, little did we know that their food was unbelievably tasty. The flavors and the unexpected twist to their menu went above and beyond what we expected. \nI got the Brisket Ramen and my husband got the Lamb, they were both amazing but I highly recommend the Brisket. \nThis is restaurant has moved to my top 3 places to eat at in Philly. OUTSTANDING food and great service!"}
{"input": "Love Chatham Tap!  Wish I could go here more often.  Anytime we have a babysitter I try and go here.  The beer is fantastic! And the food is so good.  I love, love, love their bread sticks and as a  connoisseur of bread sticks this is saying a lot.  Also, they have a lot of soccer (football) on for anyone who is a big fan.  One of my most favorite bars in Indy."}
{"input": "I don't often eat ice cream. But, when I do; I go here. The first time I went there last year a neighbor told me about the pumpkin. I tried it and it was the best ice cream/custard I had ever had. The staff are pleasant, courteous, and energetic. \n\nOn my trip there yesterday they were giving 10% of proceeds toward a dog rescue I'm involved with. I was impressed how comfortable the seating area is despite being on a busy road. Cute find here in tarpon springs. Check out the way the cone lights up at night with cute sprinkles."}
{"input": "Amazing wine tour!! \n\nMy boyfriend and I took this tour on a weekday in between Christmas and New Years. We specifically picked this tour for the added education value. Aside from learning the basics about wine tasting, you also get to venture into the vineyards where you learn about the planting, growing, and harvesting of the grape, as well as seeing behind the scenes of the fermentation and bottling process. Our tour guide Antonio was wonderful, personable, and full of knowledge about the history of Santa Barbara and wine in the area. Top notch host that made the experience that much more enjoyable!  \n\nI would highly recommend this all day, delicious edventure!"}
{"input": "Had booked rooms a month in advance for a bachelor party. Waited for 2 hours and rooms were still not ready for check-in as the clock passed 5pm. Representative Leslie at the front desk was extremely rude, and was not willing to let us store our baggage while we waited for our room. Will never stay here again."}
{"input": "I wish they served a bigger menu of dim sum because it's amazing here! In my opinion, this is the best place for dim sum in reno (CaiE's oriental cafe seems like they serve pre-frozen dim sum). We order in advance and dine in. Whenever I'm craving chicken feet and siu mai, this is the go to. Unless we can go over the hill to Sac. \n\nThey have a good combo meal. I enjoy their sesame chicken with fried rice. Hubby gets beef and broccoli or shrimp and vegetables. Comes with a nice combo appetizer and/or hot cup of soup."}
{"input": "Authentic food, great flavored, great staff, great portions. The lamb riblets were cooked to perfection in olive oil and lemon juice of course... Easily the best lamb I've had anywhere...including Astoria, NY. The Saganaki, Horta, Skordalia, Horiatiki (Greek salad)...dessert. It was all top notch. Whether you are Greek or not, don't miss Hellas, you won't be disappointed."}
{"input": "This is hands down my favorite brewery in The world!! My husband is from STL and every time we go back to visit his family we visit the brewery! Most recently, we didn't\"Beer School\" with some of our friends and it was AWESOME!! I would definitely recommend it! & if it's your first time visit do the Brewery tour first because seeing the Clydesdales and the ends and outs of this brewery was amazing!!! I can't wait to go back and do the \"Brew Master\"!! Until next time, Budweiser!"}
{"input": "Cool spot in a great location.\nWe got there early, so didn't have the same crushing crowds others have talked about.\nThe bartenders are awesome.\nMade me a Perfect Rye Manhattan on the rocks, never had one before...I'm hooked.\nEasily the best burger I've ever had!\nWill absolutely be back"}
{"input": "We were extremely pleased with our omelets. Simple, honest and tasty food. The concierge at our hotel recommended this restaurant for a \"health-food\" type of breakfast per my request. I wish I were staying longer so I could try pancakes."}
{"input": "The staff are friendly and attentive.  They offer a wide variety of quality dancewear products at a decent price, but don't have many options for any one kind of product, at least not for men's dancewear.  The location's convenient if you live in the city, and I always stop by here first if I need something new, but three out of four times I don't find what I'm looking for."}
{"input": "Great little authentic Italian restaurant. We eat there regularly never had a bad meal.  Gets really crowded on weekends so make reservations.  It's byob which is really nice."}
{"input": "Took my vehicle here for some work a few years ago for a manufacturer recall. Problem went away and then started hearing another noise which I thought was related, but turned out was a completely different issue. Kevin and his mechanic lifted my car right up and fixed the issue FREE OF CHARGE even though I told them I'd pay. Outstanding individuals for doing that. Highly recommend!"}
{"input": "- TIP:  Their black garlic wings are some of the best wings in the city.\n\n- CON:  Recent happy hour addition was downright disappointing.  Quality of dishes wasn't up to Cheu's standard.  Service was curt.  \n\n- BOTTOM LINE:  It pains me to give this place 3 stars.  A year ago, I emphetically would proclaim it to be my favorite restaurant in the city.  But they've lost their way.  Hand torn noodles are gone from the menu.  Service has been shoddy (it used to be extremely welcoming).  Food quality has been inconsistent.  It's a shame, because I want to keep on loving this place."}
{"input": "Really really good.  I had the vegetarian spring rolls and chicken pho. The broth was incredible. Awesome fast and friendly service! Highly recommend!"}
{"input": "Good beer.  Really good beer.  Nice people.  Clean.  No food but they do food trucks some nights - doesn't help day drinkers (they did offer up menus of places that deliver).  This place is a keeper."}
{"input": "I wish I could rate this place higher as it's the only place in the city with my all time favourite beer on tap, however the three stars is fair. \n\nEven when you sit at the wood here the service is normally a bit slow and standoffish which is odd.  \n\nThe room itself isn't exactly inviting and the setup just seems off.  I can't pinpoint what it is but it doesn't feel comfortable really at all.  \n\nGood specials and they had decent food which is nice that's in their favor.  \n\nKeep the Rogue Nut Brown on tap and I'll still be coming back."}
{"input": "So... This place is the sh*t. By far the classiest spot on the block, Siam is nudging STL standards up and up. The sashimi:  top grade. The outdoor patio: perfect to enjoy a beer/conversation off the dance floor. The music: something for everyone -- and the last couple nights I've been, the guest dj's we're KILLING some deep house grooves that rival NYC and Miami.  The best thing, though, may be the crowd: a solid mix that don't need labels, don't want pretense, just want a solid, quality night out.  F*ck yeah, Siam!"}
{"input": "Our Mother's Day flowers were just delivered to my mom and I got this text from her: \"I've never heard of Kinzel Flowers but these are by far the nicest flowers I've ever gotten and they smell wonderful.\"  When you make my wonderful momma happy, you get 5 stars!!!  Thank you Kinzel's!"}
{"input": "My friend and I were in Phila for the night. I found The Prime Rib on my gps. Wow this place was sophisticated , yet not pretentious.  Classy and refined yet relaxed.  It has a very New York feel to it. The Host was a gem . Brilliant personality in such a young man . Our waiter was Logan, a 19yr old college student who knows more about food and wine than anyone ive ever met. Ask for him for a truly wonderful dining experience.  Now the food. Just OMG is all I can say . I had the Veal Chop. Rare. ..best damn veal chop ever. My friend had the bone in prime rib...The best she ever had without a doubt.  We both agreed this was in our top 5 meals of our life....worth EVERY penny."}
{"input": "One of many stops here it's always fresh food for a reasonable price .My favorite appetizer is the blackened calamari and alligator . It's small and cozy but they are expanding ."}
{"input": "It's our go-to place. Great pancakes!! Quick, friendly. We usually go for breakfast but went for lunch the other day; loved the burger."}
{"input": "Thank you \nBest coffee in NOLA\nSuper helpful staff\nGreat service great food \nVery clean table \nFast service"}
{"input": "We went a few months ago and had an appetizer platter which had cheese and honey. It was very good. Prices are somewhat reasonable and the atmosphere is good"}
{"input": "Mediocre Mexican food in a tacky location. Too many tourists and annoying families with loud kids. I had the taco salad which was really good but that's about it. The service rushed us out and the prices are a little steep. Will not go back"}
{"input": "Really delicious and fresh fish. One of the best sushi restaurants I've ever tried. The place is exceptionally small, so going with a large group of people is not ideal."}
{"input": "This is a very nice Sams club. \n\nThey have a wide selection of everything needed.  The employees are always super nice.  \n\nThe only reason I gave 4 stars instead if 5 is because of the parking lot.  The parking spaces are very tiny and it seems like they don't have enough spaces to hold the cars needed to shop here."}
{"input": "I ate here for their GF pizza crust. Pretty typical crust and toppings. Good taste. My family said the regular pizzas were excellent."}
{"input": "Fantastic crab cakes! They also have the best rack of lamb i have ever had with the zinfandel glaze and mint jelly.... mmmmmm! A little on the pricey side, though.. average per person is at least 40 bucks."}
{"input": "Great sushi place. it's on the pricey side of the sushi, but the taste is phenomenal. the best pick is the baked Philadelphia roll. Come and enjoy :)"}
{"input": "This is my first review and I really felt it was needed.  I love to cook but also love eating out . It's very exciting to see all the new restaurants opening up around town and I really want them all to succeed. I've been to Nox  many times now. I have to say it's been so inconsistent last night being the Worst!!!  Waitstaff were inexperienced, appetizers came out with the dinners and only one was hot.  Had to send two out of the three dinners back for various reasons.  As you know Restaurants seem to come and go around here so please guys pay attention and remember you're only as good as your staff. \nSincerely"}
{"input": "I love this place. \n\nWas in town for a convention and I stumbled in. It is a tiny place, with only Sam - an old Japanese man - working behind the counter. He seemed annoyed that I was interrupting him making sushi for other people, and clearly was a big fan of rules. \n\n-You have to sit and wait for him to be ready to ask for your order.\n-Even though its only $1, don't order miso, it makes you look like an ignorant American\n-Don't get impatient - you'll be waiting 15-30 minutes (as the hand written sign says). \n-No phone orders. He gets mad if you even ask. \n\nIf you know what you're in for, its a great place. Two enormous rolls that taste great for $6. I went back the next day as well."}
{"input": "I have never stayed at a hotel so ghetto. Sure the atmosphere is great and very classy looking. However the staff is the opposite. First of all, my friend booked us a suite for the bachelorette party she was planning. They gave us two separate rooms and my friend had to beg for them to be at least next door to each other since they ran out of suites. Then to make up for it, they threw in free valet. The next day her car had been keyed on her door when the valet brought it from the parking garage. Seriously? Worst experience and I certainly won't ever be back."}
{"input": "My spouse and son are deaf. I do not understand why this complex doesn't show more open-captioned films?  It is 2012 and this theatre needs to realize that deaf people like to go out too the movies just like anyone else."}
{"input": "I was recently in an accident where someone hit the passenger side of my car, and with my car being a lease I was paranoid and super frustrated. However, Ken, Service Manager, helped alleviate my worries. From when I first called first thing in the morning following the accident up until I picked up my car from being repaired a week later I had nothing but pleasant exchanges with him. Ken walked me through each and every step and made me feel comfortable with the work that was going to be done, as well as provided the lowest quote as compared to the other body shops I checked out.  I would definitely recommend Ken and his team not only because they completed the work in a timely fashion, but also because their communication and follow through was super helpful in a very stressful situation."}
{"input": "The food is probably one of the more mediocre Chinese food I've had, but the main appeal of this place is renting a karaoke room for a large group of people and BYOing. The restaurant is exceptionally capable of dealing with huge and rowdy groups, and the food comes out to be a decent price and comes out quickly. The karaoke machines all have pretty up to date songs in a variety of languages."}
{"input": "This place is adorable! The hot and cold tubs are amazing as are the saunas. The staff is nice and helpful the food was so good. Its 24hr,tons of options as far as treatments/massages/packages. I love this place! Nothing else like this around here(that I know of)"}
{"input": "The longest bar in the City!  For as crazy busy as the Happy Hours are, the Friday and Saturday late night crowds are really relaxed and there's always a place to sit.  This is the perfect place on a Saturday night after a show at the Troc if you don't want to go to Chinatown or a Dive bar.   I've been walking over after shows at the Electric Factory lately and it's THE place to unwind after standing up for 3 hours.  \n\nIBP has all kinds of sports packages so it's a great place to go to watch that out of town football or baseball game.  The upstairs bar has pool tables and a separate jukebox.\n\nedit:  RIP IBP"}
{"input": "Reading the reviews, I cannot agree with the others which tout the quality of the food. I had the dinner buffet and the food was mediocre at best. The selection was fine, though they do charge a higher price if you want crab legs. BTW- neither Easy Buffet nor Ginger Buffet charge extra for crab legs. The flavors were there, but the meats were dried out, concentrated, and fried foods soggy and tough as if the they hadn't been turned over in hours and were just sitting on the steam table.  \n\nService was very nice but slow, especially since there were only 3 tables going the whole time we were there.  I think they had him responsible for too many things other that waiting tables.  \n\nThere is a slim chance I'll come back since there are 3 other Chinese buffets in the area that I prefer over Dragon.  Perhaps if I do, there will be more guests to turn over the food and I can update my ratings."}
{"input": "Never, ever disappointed here!  Jonathan is a master of combining unexpected favors, textures, and unique ingredients to yield a mouth orgasm.  Oh yes!"}
{"input": "These folks are truly remarkable. My windows and carpets are absolutely spotless. The crew is professional, courteous, and so reasonably priced. We had them clean and polish our wood floors, and they look AMAZING!!! Highly recommend this fabulous group."}
{"input": "Been to this location twice and will never go back again!!!!\n\nFirst time was mediocre, the second time was so very disappointing it beggars belief. I ordered some ribs and had to send them back because one half was warm and the other half was refrigerator cold. They came back and one side was really hot and the other side was still cold, third time it was edible. The manager came over the third time to apologize, never once offered to comp anything. I'm not the kind of guy to cause a fuss to get something comped, but to send something back three times to get it cooked properly and only get an insincere apology really pisses me off, enough for me to write this review."}
{"input": "This is a small hole in the wall in the African section of Woodland Avenue.  Though it might not look like much, there is some good food coming out of its kitchen representing Senegal and West Africa.  I enjoyed the national dish of Senegal - Thiboudienne - although note that here they do a version without the usual tomato sauce.  I also took home a Jollof Rice which is often called the mother dish of Jambalaya.  There are a few hightop tables inside for dining or you can order the food to-go.  Either way, service is friendly."}
{"input": "Stopped in tonight for a light bite to eat. I was so impressed! Great service, great fresh, fresh food and beautiful atmosphere- we sat outside in the warm October evening air.  Lisa was a great host, explaining the menu and checked in with us frequently - we ended up chatting with her quite a bit and that only made the whole evening more enjoyable. What a wonderful place- we will certainly be back for more!"}
{"input": "Thank you Yelp for another good find. A great choice when in town. Just behind Busch Gardens, being from out of town I may have been skeptical being off the beaten path and not the best neighborhood. Don't let that hold you back. Went with my kids and glad we did. The service is very friendly and professional. Must be the owners, they take pride in their business and it shows. Food was delicious, perfectly prepared and presented."}
{"input": "I've always liked this restaurant no matter what location I've been to. Nothing beats having a huge steamy pot of seafood, potatoes, and corn. So good!"}
{"input": "Poor service but it depends entirely on which waiter.  We've gone there often and the food is better than average (with one exception see below) and had good service, but this trip, it was almost 10 minutes to even get a waiter to come by and give chips and salsa and get drink order (I was 1 minute from just getting up and leaving).  The food came for the 3 of us, but not a plate in sight to eat off of when we clearly stated in the beginning that we were sharing the 3 dishes.  Watching him with other tables, he was clearly only paying attention as it came time to leave a tip, but not at other times during the meal.  That being said, we have been happy with other wait staff on other visits.\n\nThe Shrimp Nachos were a huge disappointment, the limp nachos and less than generous amount of shrimp were buried under a large amount of lettuce.  I've never seen lettuce on nachos.\n\nWe'll be back, but we will watch which waiter serves us."}
{"input": "Please do not bring your loved one to this hospital, they use their patients as guinea pigs and staff have little regard for the privacy and dignity of patients even if they require critical care! My auntie is struggling to stay alive and when my mom stayed with her just two days ago mom had to stand in the room with her the entire time because there were no chairs. When she asked the nurse for a chair the nurse rudely responded that they couldn't accomodate everyone in the hospital. We are looking into transferring my auntie out of this terrible place."}
{"input": "I purchased a Groupon for Wine and Canvas for my bestie's birthday last year.  You can go on their website to look at their calendar of events to book your seats.  The new calendar month is released on the 20th of the previous month.  We chose an event which was held at a little restaurant called Toast Wine in New Tampa.  We ordered sweet white wine, a cheese plate, and quesadillas.  All were tasty and palatable.  The staff was accommodating and tended to us well.  All patrons were provided with an apron, paint brushes, multiple colors of paint, and a canvas.  The instructor guided us step by step to create our paintings while fun pop music played in the background.  Upon finishing, we took a group photo displaying our paintings.  We had such a fun and unique experience and I highly recommend trying it.  It is great for special occasions or just for fun.  You can also book private parties."}
{"input": "Great pho and the service was outstanding.  Easy parking too.  Staff enjoys serving and makes you feel welcome.  Food was very good."}
{"input": "RUDE RUDE RUDE, couldn't be bothered by myself or my friend and the small basic tattoo we wanted. Over priced the tattoo and and had the worst attitude ever.

{"input": "I know what you're thinking. 5 Stars?! Really?\n\nIf you're into craft beers, this place has a nice selection to choose from. Atypical from other Rally gas stations, this place is almost like a beer haven. My buddy is pretty big into craft beers. He literally spent a sold 20mins browsing through their selection looking for any rare beers to bring back to South Florida. The selection is impressive for a gas station/convenience store. THAT's why I offer the 5 stars. Craft beer."}
{"input": "I've taken a lot of spin classes over the years, and nothing compares to the classes at Body Cycle. From the nice, clean space and amazing bikes, to the welcoming and motivating instructors, every class is a top notch work out.\n\nFor anyone who struggles to fit workouts in, the online scheduling system makes it easy to plan ahead (and there's no need to line up way in advanced like many gyms make you do).\n\nThere is no way I can write this review without giving Russell, the owner of Body Cycle, a shout out. Russell's passion for fitness and cycling is so evident, as is his desire for all of his clients to succeed. He is always dropping in to classes to check in/provide encouragement, and is open to ideas and recommendations from anyone. Russell always wears a smile on his face, even when he's kicking your butt in class!"}
{"input": "This review is about the receptionist.\n\nNormally I have a decent experience here, but this morning I  called to schedule an appt for the same night at 7:45. The lady up sold me on a special, said \"see you tonight,\" and we ended our conversation. \n\nGot to the salon and was informed my services were scheduled for tomorrow, not tonight. Well, im going away tomorrow, so that is just not going to work. The girl at the desk was very unapologetic and made it sound like it was my fault. They were 100% booked, which I understand, but she offered no real sorry or anything.\n\nI just walked out feeling pretty stupid, although they should be the ones feeling stupid. \n\nWill start taking my business elsewhere."}
{"input": "Great breakfast fare and all. Eggs provençale was pretty good; all kinds of herbs and seasonings, but cooked inconsistently. Tomato on the side was awesome.\n\nOmelets were executed well, and the pastries were pretty impressive.\n\nBut the coffee was horrendously bad. And without good coffee, what's the point of breakfast?\n\nAnd I still can't trust restaurants that have misspellings on their menus. Even if the misspelling is from another language."}
{"input": "Great place for families, and food is fantastic! The recipes are creative and original. We've been there several times and always have a great experience!"}
{"input": "I got lucky driving home last month from Orlando.  I just happened to pull into this Outback and order the Peppered Ahi Tuna appetizer from the bar - it was amazing!  \n\nIt comes on a bed of cabbage salad (with carrots, I think).  The Ahi is crusted with a pepper mix and seared.  There is a little side dressing, milk-based, like Ranch.  The dressing is not necessary but I ate it anyways.\n\nThis was my second time back here and I ordered the Ahi again.  It was better than the first time!  \n\nI'm cutting back on portion sizes with my meals so this was perfect for me, tasty and nutritious, but not too filling.\n\nA post further down this page indicates this is one on 3 test kitchens nationally - if so, I surely hope they keep the peppered Ahi tuna because I will be looking for it in my neighborhood (Sarasota) restaurants."}
{"input": "It's hard to judge this place on service because the time that I do come here was always for UFC. That said, it's always jam pack and service can be extremely slow. Overall food is decent. Nothing amazing. If there's a fight going on, this is a good place to watch it as they consistently have them unlike other places. You may want to eat before you show up though."}
{"input": "A spectacular establishment that instantly takes you back to childhood memories.  In a quest to find a favorite, yet elusive candy bar, our search brought us to Cravin's.  Leaving grandpa in the car, my daughter and I went in expecting to only spend a few minutes.  Needless to say, we spent way more time and money than originally planned...but in a good way.  Cravin's carried our holy grail of candy, the Cup O Gold, and a bonus was finding Mint Rocky Road! Since I was visiting from Korea on R&R, I bought an entire box of C.O.G. as well as Idaho Spuds, a handful of Mint RR's, a Star Wars candy dispenser for my hubby's office and a few other things.  I must have walked around the store at least 3 times and know I still didn't see everything that was there.  I was very appreciative of the military discount and I can't wait to return on my next trip home to visit family."}
{"input": "Target is a big chain store filled with a wide selection of clothing, electronics, housewares, health & beauty items, cleaning supplies, and even groceries (in some locations), and on and on. As my sister likes to say, \"Target is where America shops for stuff\". If I'm doing a general shopping trip, then Target is a great place to look for most of the items on my list.\n\nThis Target is located in the northern end of the shopping center at N. Dale Mabry and Ehrlich. I guess it's true that each store echos the needs of the local community since I prefer the selection at the bigger Super Target on W. Hillsborough which is near to Westchase. This store seems to appeal to an older audience with established families, and that's not me.\n\nSince I was shopping for an exciting list of items like plastic trash bags, laundry detergent, and assorted housewares I opted for the convenience of this store, and found everything I needed. The store is clean, the aisles wide, but the checkout process is generally slow."}
{"input": "Wells Fargo is a great atmosphere for all ages. Flyers host a great game every time I got no matter where you sit. I would recommend everyone to a game even if you don't like hockey!!"}
{"input": "Nice scenery of nature. Great trail for running, walking, hiking and biking. Plenty of places to sit for a short break along the way."}
{"input": "Went on a Monday to have a daiquiri and watch a little bit of the NBA basketball game.  Asked the young lady working if she would be willing to turn on the game and was told she was watching Netflix.  I guess customer service is not important anymore.  Won't ever go back."}
{"input": "This place was phenomenal. The food I must say was some of the best Italian food I've ever eaten. I also unfortunately have a broken cap on my front tooth ( ugh) so I had to order something that was soft and good for a tooth problem. The flavors screamed old world Italian and kids/adults were very happy with their meals. I had a pesto sauce on a long thin noodle - cooked to perfection. There was chicken parm at the table and it was not overly fried- very tender and flavorful.  This is A+."}
{"input": "2-for-1 drinks on Thursday, which is great, but don't dare order anything other beer!  Someone in our group ordered a margarita, and the server said, \"What else do you want, in case the bartender doesn't want to make that?\"  She settled on a vodka tonic, and apparently the bartender didn't want to make the margarita because she got a vodka tonic (which several of us concluded tasted horribly).  Another friend who was at a different table told a similar story.  Someone in his group tried to order a cocktail, and the server actually said, \"I doubt the bartender will make that.  I'll buy everybody a round if you just order beer.\"  WHAT?!?  Maybe the bartender was having a bad day, or maybe the bartender and server had a bad break-up, but this is no way to run a bar!!!  It's a shame that the colossal attitude behind the bar will ruin what otherwise is a nice, smoke-free bar."}
{"input": "The burgers are amazing! French fries are decent (so get the onion rings)."}
{"input": "My friends and I went here one time for margaritas, and we sat outside. We were charged a $5 cover, and I have literally NEVER encountered as horrible service as I have at Copa. After we got drinks we didn't see the waitress again. We actually had to go inside to close our tab."}
{"input": "One of the best dinner experiences we had in a long time. I took my wife to celebrate her birthday. The food was top notch. We did the 4 course meal. For the amount of food and especially the quality, you can't beat the price. I loved the ambiance and would definitely recommend for someone looking for a nice dinner downtown."}
{"input": "The event started at 1 and we got there about 1:30. It was so packed you could not enjoy yourself. Most of tents were not even wine, either advertisment, beer, or food you had to pay for. By 3 o' clock most of the tables were out of everything... It was suppose to go till 5?! Definitely was not worth the money and probably will not be back next year."}
{"input": "I like what this place does, the food is good, the service was excellent, and its a sort of twist on greek food. Owner was very nice and helpful, kinda tucked away off nolensville but easy to find. I recommend the falafel, and hummus."}
{"input": "I love kimpton hotels. My husband took me here for my birthday and it was grand. We stayed in the majestic suite on the 10th floor. We had views of Independence Hall and the Constitution Center. The room was beautiful, very chic. My favorite part was the bathroom with the huge soaking tub. Definirely recommend this hotel."}
{"input": "The wait time was pretty low we got seated so quickly even though it was absolutely packed, however the waitress we had didn't come to our table hardly at all we had empty drinks for half our dinner. It would almost be worth it if the food was good but it was average and I have had much better for cheaper. \n\nOverall experience: meh! Not to die for but not totally disgusting either"}
{"input": "Drinks are overpriced and nowhere in SB should charge cover but the music is undeniably fun."}
{"input": "I could be craving pizza and be walking by and STILL not go in again. I will say the ingredients are definitely fresh and service was great however the pizza is just plain not good. The crust is so thin that the pizza is cold within a few minutes and it was just a little floppy and bland. I wanted to love this place but with so many other pizzerias in the area I won't be going back."}
{"input": "I love this place. It keeps getting better and better. My favorite is the Rajin Cajun sandwich, but I've never had anything here that I don't like. The owner is also a great guy who works there all the time."}
{"input": "Such an all-around great experience coming here. The service was great, the fried chicken was on point (especially if you mix the lemon-honey yogurt sauce with the hot sauce and put it on top). Also, the garage atmosphere was taken very seriously. I loved every minute of it. The raw wood, the lights, the whiskey selection, the service - really the whole shebang. Oh, did I mention the biscuits?! I will be back"}
{"input": "Tasting for our wedding cakes. Tasted 3 gluten free flavors - chocolate, vanilla, pina colada. And 5 regular flavors. Was a nice tasting experience. I'll post another review after we have the wedding and get the cake."}
{"input": "Food was decent.  The fact that its a BYOB is great.  Environment is a little stuffy and they definitely cater to an older crowd."}
{"input": "I have had many MANY massage experiences in my life no this is absolutely the top of the line! Freedom massage is the best place to get a rub down! This place is very clean, zen, down to earth and relaxing. The owner knows her stuff and goes the extra 10 miles to make sure everyone has a fabulous experience. From the hand painted thoughtful art on the walls to the divine music to the very talented masseuses, this place completely rocks the entire massage experience! If you have the opportunity make sure to stop by here for an experience of a lifetime."}
{"input": "I am very glad I went to Sunshine Auto.  Everyone was very nice and professional.   I would recommend them"}
{"input": "Some people don't like the kitsch of a Mongolian BBQ, but I do.  I love being able to mix up my own meal and my own sauces and have someone else cook it.  \n\n\nMongolian of Eagle is great.  Located in a strip mall.  It is the cleanest, brightest lit Mongolian BBQ restaurant I have been in.  There is a wide selection of items to include in your meal.  Beef, chicken, and pork.  No lamb.  Service is friendly and quick.  \n\nJudging by the high schoolers in at lunch break, it is a very popular place.\n\nIf you are in the area and interested in a quick, casual meal, this is the place to try."}
{"input": "Octopus, pizza, bar service. I love the laid back vibe, unpretentious food, and great flavor combinations."}
{"input": "I am originally from Hong Kong and really enjoy spicy food.  This is one of the most authentic Szechuan Restaurant in the area.  In fact, it's really the only Chinese restraunt in the area that gets filled up with the majority of Chinese patron's on any given night.  Bottom line is Chinese people go where the food is good, so hopefully this place will continue to serve good food to keep us coming.  Szechuan food is spicy, so beware.  Each time we go, we order the Happy Fish in Spicy Soup.  The soft shell crab is another one we've tried.  The tea duck is great.  Anyone can definitely gravitate to the typical americanized Chinese food, but ask the server for the authentic Szechuan style.  I'm giving this place 1 less star becaue we've experienced a mix of servers where some are more patient and courteous than others.\n\nOn the final note, we've frequented this restaurant about once a month, but we've never had the problems with flies like some of the other reviewers."}
{"input": "Nice place to shoot friendly staff. Felt very safe on the range plus I enjoyed the 21.00 all day shoot."}
{"input": "Nice brunch spot located in Northern Liberties. Saw a segment of Diner's, Drive-Ins and Dives a couple years ago that highlighted HS&E, so this place has been on my radar for a quite a while. If you go on the weekend, expect a wait. I waited about 30 mins, which in the grand scene of things wasn't that bad. The place is small inside, but they do have outdoor seating. The food and service were good. I had the eggs benedict, which is really not a 'go to' for me, but I was feeling adventurous. The eggs benedict was good as was the 4th St. Corn. The service was good. I did have to remind my waiter a second time to bring me a lemonade, but it was pretty busy. I would return and try something else on the menu."}
{"input": "Aside from the staff being super friendly, the food is quite tasty and the environment is super chill yet a little hectic at the same time but it somehow works. \n\nWhat I appreciated the most about Milktooth, is you can really tell the food is made with good quality ingredients. I definitely had my heart set on the Sweet Tea Chicken Fried Biscuit and was a little bummed to hear they were sold out. However, the little bear plate was simple, yet delicious and paired nicely with a side of savory whey grits. Also, the slow drip coffee is on point .\n\nOverall, Milktooth is a great addition to the Fletcher Place/Fountain Square area. I'm looking forward to spending many weekends at this place."}
{"input": "We had lunch today at Hellas & it never disappoints..one of our favorite places for years. Tried the flaming Oopa cheese..very tasty..& the best Greek salad anywhere. Service shines with young waiters who are there when you need them. Their adjoining bakery has a wonderful baklava cheesecake that you will remember a long time."}
{"input": "If you want to be culture shocked, go to Marrakesh. It feels like a really authentic, cultural experience, supplemented by delicious food. The staff and management have been incredibly courteous and solicitous both times I've attended. If you're squeamish about eating with your hands or having to share food, you'll probably want to skip."}
{"input": "Incredible food.  Quick.  Ordered a pizza and garlic knots; delivered fresh and quick, like 30 minutes.  Such friendly service too!  Wow.  Good, good, good food."}
{"input": "Straight to the point: the service, the one dish I ordered and the inside was very inviting, my hamburger was made perfectly like I like it. The restaurant is really nice and they have good drinks.. No complaints"}
{"input": "Yay!!!  St. Louis finally has a West Elm!  The store is big, salespeople are friendly and--at least for a limited time--students get 10% off their entire order.  The only downside is having to schlep large purchases through the mall to the parking lot."}
{"input": "I cannot comment on the food as I had only a couple beers. I did have the white IPA and a red ale which were good but not blow me away. I might be spoiled having 2 friends who brew professionally but the beers were good, not outstanding. The location is kind of far from other stuff which normally wouldn't bother me but everything around is seriously industrial and scenery does make a better place. They do discount the beer $1 when a train comes by and maybe that's the best they can make of a meh location. Probably give it more like a 3.5 stars. It does say something that there was a loyal following at 4pm on a Sunday."}
{"input": "I visited this location on several occasions this last week and was thoroughly disappointed on every visit. From employees too busy joking with each other to help customers, to waiting for my drink because they made the drinks and food for their regulars first to having an employee offer to help, then walked away from the counter to go do something else, which resulted in my having to bet back into line and wait again. My Vanilla Latte is what you would expect from a Starbucks, consistent and good, but the customer service will keep me from coming back."}
{"input": "This was my favorite breakfast so far.. In Nashville from NYC with husband and 2 children.. From the moment we walked in everyone was so nice and friendly. We had eggs and biscuits.. delicious!\nMy son orders waffles and the other french toast , by when he saw how good the waffles were and wanted to switch they did with no problem.  Highly recommended!"}
{"input": "The staff is very good at providing misinformation with, what I can only guess is, the objective of stretching out simple things into multiple, billable appointments. Be sure to show up on time so you can have the honor of waiting for netley d'souza to stroll by, in an unapologetic fashion, 45 minutes after your scheduled appointment. A word of caution, though. Do not suggest that his staff treat you with decency or that anyone other than yourself be punctual. Doctor d'souza will respond by having a staff member call you to tell you to find another doctor. If you're looking for integrity, punctuality, consideration for your time, a competent staff, a doctor who is on top of his game, or anyone to do anything other than give you a hard time or do more than the bare minimum, well, I guess you had better keep looking."}
{"input": "I have an AHS warranty. These guys were sent out. Spent all of 8 minutes tryi g to up lugged. Then told me I needed to put a clean out opening down stair in my finished basement bathroom. Which of course wouldn't be covered by my warranty. Called Roto Rooter, they came out had my drain unclogged in less than 15 minutes. Don't wastes your time or money. They seemed more interested in the service call fee than actually doing any work!"}
{"input": "Love this place! I stopped in for brunch on Saturday and had a fantastic experience. Our server, Steph, was phenomenal. She went over specials of the day and ensured that we had a great meal. We started with the Blue Duck fries. They were PHENOMENAL! Definitely get them on every visit. I had the duck benedict and my friend had the chicken and waffles. Both were good. The chicken was nice and crispy but could have used more seasoning. The waffle was fluffy and delicious. The duck breast was tasty and went well with the cherry siracha sauce but I didn't like how the sauce tasted with the rest of the dish. It was taken off of our bill without me asking although they prepared it properly, it simply wasn't to my taste. Overall we had a great experience here. I def recommend it. \n(Oh and it's BYOB. Wish I had known to bring a bottle)"}
{"input": "There was a hair in my girlfriends rice. Staff is really nice, food is mediocre. We just were in city an wanted a quick bite to eat an with the good ratings, we thought we were gonna be plesaently surpirsed. We were not. More than likely won't come back."}
{"input": "Fun and enjoyable place to sample unique wines. Sarah our host made the experience a wonderful occasion. A must new stop on the winery trail. Try it, you'll like it!"}
{"input": "MY favorite place to eat in Nashville. The food is pricey, but delicious. Many a date or business dinner spot, not some much for bringing your friends to, unless they like this type of vibe."}
{"input": "Very cool spot with nice people, good drinks, great music. 4 stars instead of 5 because a VERY popular restaurant that is located in a place that has rain almost daily and has mostly outdoor seating has failed to realize umbrellas at tables are a thing."}
{"input": "A hot spot of a little gem! Plenty is whiskey and creative drinks flowing.. Always an interesting crowd, the charm of the Burg! \nBy the way, the good us amazing and great happy hour specials:::"}
{"input": "I remember when this was a great restaurant, decades ago.  So,as we're walking by heading for Indian food, one companion tells us about the G.R. makeover, so we go in.  Well, he may have changed the management and the menu, but he forgot to introduce the kitchen staff to their spice shelf.  My chicken mole looked nice, but the sauce had zero taste.  The steak tacos, while done with good meat [diner was not asked how he wanted his steak, by the way, and it was rarer than he likes] but the steak was totally unseasoned so didn't have any pizazz.  I won't be back."}
{"input": "Great food, awful service. I ordered online at 6:20, site said it would be ready at 6:40. I get there at 6:37 and i expected to wait a couple minutes but not the entire 20 minutes it takes to cook my food. They didn't even start cooking it till i got there. I leave at 7. They did nothing for the inconvenience and still made me pay full. Honestly, I'm so upset with how the whole situation was handled. Where is the customer service??"}
{"input": "Their coconut soup is some of the best I've ever had! Everyone that works there is very polite and courteous"}
{"input": "I finally got my water ice fix this weekend. Well actually, I kind of went twice, ssshh. The chocolate-cherry gelati was seriously orgasmic. Why did it take me until August to finally make it down there??! I will definitely be back a few more times while they are still open for the season. And if you haven't been, GO! I corrupted not one, but two Rita's fans this weekend."}
{"input": "The Lucky Perk is a pretty cool place to meet with friends or clients. I've been here a few times and always get good coffee and an inviting atmosphere. The only thing I didn't care for was the sausage burrito. It was hot but 99% potatoes and a 1% sausage. Not worth the money. Other than that, it's a cool place and I'll go back."}
{"input": "I love a doughnut. They'd be part of my last meal on death row and i would be happy if they were purchased from upper nine. We walked 40 minutes to their new temp/perm location and it was worth every step. The owner was super cool. Told us about the business and helped us pick out 3 awesome doughnuts to share. We had the Louisiana Strawberry, chocolate salted caramel and the key lime pie (the only doughnut to  ever start a fight). They were all great but the key lime pie was super special. Coffee was strong and great too."}
{"input": "Looks can be deceiving... from the outside this place looks sketchy but it's not so bad on the inside. It's not somewhere I would seek out but it's not bad if it's cold and you don't want to walk far to a nicer bar. I heard that they have good live music... Maybe I'll be back."}
{"input": "Mazzaros market is fat kid heaven. \nWhen you walk inside through the arch you begin to smell the baked goods and coffees being made. \nI immediately dart towards the cookies and pitzelles. Grab a cannoli then make my way over to the Fresh pastas being made. If i could afford to live inside here i would but then i would eat everything and they would have to roll me out the door. Hands down this is the best Italian market to get all your needs for a nice Sunday dinner."}
{"input": "Steve our Roto-Rooter tech saved us!! Thanks to Steve! We just moved into a new house and had sewer back-up a week later. It was coming out into the yard and not pretty. We are running free now and hopefully won't need to call back any time soon. If we do we will certainly call Roto- rooter again!!!"}
{"input": "Worst delivery experience. Prob never order from there. Even after reading saying it's good food. I would give zero. Foods not bad."}
{"input": "WAWA is the go-to-guy of convenience stores. Whether you're looking for a quick meal, or a late-night snack(presumably while intoxicated), the store contains everything imaginable. Had it not been for their lack of lottery tickets, SLURPEE products and booze, I would consider WAWA to eliminate all other convenience stores, and monopolize the entire industry. Try the stuffed jalapeño pretzel."}
{"input": "Came here on a Saturday afternoon for brunch with some friends. Let me just say, my experience was AMAZING. So, where should I begin?.... OH.. Let's start with the Tiramisu french toast. Now, I'm not one to order from the sweeter side of breakfast, but these were basically screaming at me from the menu. These little slices of heaven came out fast (which I always appreciate) and were DELICIOUS. My other friend ordered the CANNOLI PANCAKES. UNREAL - no surprise there. Aside from the incredible food, the staff is extremely friendly and attentive. The overall vibe of this place was just so upbeat and really set a great tone for the rest of my day in Philly. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"input": "1  Fried Meat Dumplings  $ 5.25\n1  General Tso's Dinner Box  $ 7.75\n\nI gave this a four stars but let me clarify. It is what it is. It's greasy unhealthy American-Chinese food thats cheap and has way too much salt. You know they don't serve general tso's in China right? But for what it is it's a cheap and solid dinner. The General Tso's Dinner box is is a typical combo of egg roll rice and the chicken. It's pretty good but I'd only say it's an average 3 stars, nothing sticks out. The real reason I order from Golden Chopsticks quite often is their fried meat dumplings. These are the thick heavy doughy dumplings, not the thin potstickers you might be used to and you get 8 with an order for less than 6 bucks. It's a lot of food and make sure you sleep with water next to your bed because it's very salty, in a good way. So again for what they are aiming for, they do a pretty decent job. Don't skip on the dumplings!"}
{"input": "This is the best location I've dealt with. They were extremely prompt and the driver Henry was so nice. My husband was on his way home and I had to wait for him so I could pay for the pizza. This man waited in his car, in the rain, on a Friday night while I got my stuff together. \n\nThe food was hot and delicious. I got the feta and spinach stuffed bread, the chicken with bacon and tomato, and the lava cake. All were outstanding!\n\n The only thing I can really say negative about this particular experience is that they forgot the marinara sauce that I ordered online. Eh, I have spaghetti sauce, it's all good. I'll be ordering from here in the future!"}
{"input": "Came to STL for a wedding and was lucky enough to have my air B and B above this amazing bbq joint. They have a smoker outside that is cooking all day making the surrounding area smell heavenly. I order the fried Korean ribs which had a nice Smokey flavor. We also tried the fried cat fish (we ordered spicy and they're not messing around ) cooked perfectly with a corn meal breading. The fried green tomatoes were nice and had a tangy sauce on the side. Do yourself a favor and get some moonshine as well"}
{"input": "I am extremely picky when it comes to good quality pizza and am always on the look out for quality Italian pie's. Since I was a kid, I grew up with my best friends' family who are from Calabria. Their mom and grandma (spoke no English) would spoil us with the very beat home made Italian food I've ever had. She used to make multiple pizzas every Saturday...and placed a huge emphasis on the dough. Any true Italian always uses good bread and good dough for their food. With that being said, Vincent's is the best Pizza you can find outside of south Philly or center city. Very good dough and good use of cheese and sauce. Marras in south Philly is probably my favorite in the city."}
{"input": "Excellent food. Nice location. Only complaint is I requested butter for my pancakes and never got it."}
{"input": "One of the best places to get a cheese steak in the area.  They use really good meat, and really pack it in.  A bit on the small side so I recommend take out or delivery.  \n\nJust keep in mind - their small cheese steak is most other place's large."}
{"input": "Farmhouse, rustic, chic.Helpful staff with great ideas to decorate your home. Prices reasonable. Store has items from Joanna Gaines ( Fixer Upper) and much more. Finally a good home store in SB with reasonable prices."}
{"input": "Good, but expensive. \n\nWe both had steak, and it was pretty darn good. \n\nThe guacamole is nothing special. Yes, it gets made in front of you, but it gets made wrong in my opinion."}
{"input": "Mexican food in the city can be a hit or miss and it's hard to find a place that serves the authentic stuff, and his place nailed it!! Went here on a Friday night and brought a bottle of tequila. Unfortunately the free pitcher of margarita mix is only valid Monday through Thursday, but the pitcher wasn't that expensive. The empanadas and fish tacos were to die for. We also got shrimp quesadillas. Service was great! Initially they brought out the wrong type of quesadillas, and gave us the shrimp ones on the house.  The only pitfall of this whole dining experience were the complimentary chips and salsa... They were a bit meh"}
{"input": "This was my first time getting my nails done and I had a great experience. Victor was attentive and easy to talk to. He made sure I was happy every step of the way and answered any questions I had. The salon itself had a relaxed atmosphere. I'd definitely recommend!"}
{"input": "Great service and amazing food. Will always go back here. The first time we went we didn't realize it was a dressy restaurant and showed up in jeans and t-shirts. Anticipating being at least relegated to a Siberia-like table we were pleasantly surprised to be put in the center of the dining room, and the servers treated us really, really well. After several return trips ( dressed appropriately!) I can tell you that all their servers I have had are very knowledgeable about the menu and the wine list, and the food is ridiculously good. Their turtle soup alone is worth going for. We often will order a bunch of their small plates because their menu is too damn interesting! Highly reccomend."}
{"input": "Highly, highly overrated.  The food was a C minus at best.  And the service was so bad that I may never go back.  They screwed up my order completely and my no apologies.  There are a lot of other options around State Street.  Avoid this place like the plague."}
{"input": "I came here after recommendations from two different people.  The lady who waited on us was kind & wasn't impatient since it took me awhile to decide what to get.  We ordered brisket & pulled chicken. The brisket is pretty good & tender, however it had a bit of fat on it which I think is disgusting.  The pulled chicken was so delicious I almost slapped someone. The chicken was also smoked."}
{"input": "So I'm super confused as to why everyone rags on this place. They're super nice, quick, and cheap.  People have complained about their chicken fingers being dry but I have no clue what they're talking about. They're great and their honey mustard is delicious. I've had salads from there too and they give you lots of veggies which I love. Their fries are delish as well and I love that they give you cole slaw with the chicken finger platter. All and all, I love that this place is literally a few steps away from my apartment and that they have decent food. I also don't understand the greasy spoon comments... you do realize it's a pizza joint right? You aren't going there for the ambiance, more for the cheap food."}
{"input": "Healthy and simple dishes.  Fresh.  Not overcooked.  \n\nI've only ordered off the Asian menu.  I love the Bangkok curry with tofu.  Their tofu is cut to the perfect size and has a nice firmness.  \n\nThe Thai curry soup is also awesome."}
{"input": "I love this place, it has to be one of the best values in Santa Barbara as a place to stay.\n\n1. You are literally 2 blocks away from the beach, walking to local wine bars in the area is 10 minutes, walking to downtown State St. is roughly 10-15 minutes, and the best local bar in town is a 5 minute walk down the street.\n\n2. Had two double queen rooms for 8 guests and it was plenty roomy. They even got us an air bed in one because we had 3 couples and two singles. The air bed was even a nicer aerobed!\n\n3. Free beach cruiser rental! We rode to downtown the morning after to get some coffee at The Press.\n\n4. They have a simple breakfast for you included in the price. The standard OJ, fruit, and then a bagel with lox, tomato, and lettuce. It's sufficient to keep you held over until 11a or noon.\n\n5. It was very clean and reception was very nice.\n\nWould absolutely stay at this place next time we are in Santa Barbara."}
{"input": "Excellent! Got there just before they sold out for the day. Well worth it!"}
{"input": "This location is the exact reason of why I fell in love with them in the first place. My cousin and I used to go here all of the time and I would go on lunch breaks. I miss this location and didn't think I would get to have their food again until I found the one in my area. It's a good spot to go and their drinks are pretty good too."}
{"input": "Food was really good, portions are big so we were able to share which brought the price down to a more reasonable amount."}
{"input": "Great food- terrible staff. \nI work near HipCity and I think the food is inventive and fresh. But I have to steel myself to deal with the arrogant and generally unhelpful staff. Yesterday I had the nerve to ask for my salad dressing on the side after I ordered and the guy sighed and rolled his eyes and went to the window to inform them of the crime. The restaurant was not crowded (I was the only person in line) really?"}
{"input": "For my boyfriend's 31st birthday, I decided to take him to Ruth Chris because it's a steakhouse and we've heard nothing but good reviews and it's true. It was both our first time coming here, and overall everything was great. There was valet parking you payed for and our reservations were for 8:30, we got sat at that time as well.\n\nOur waiters were very friendly and understood it was our first time. I have to say the steak was beyond amazing! By far the best steak I've ever had and I've had my fair share. I got the side of mash potato, he got a baked potato as his side and the bread they serve you with pretty good. \n\nI forgot the names of our steaks, which were both different but they were perfect. Buttery, cooked well, not too burnt, just great. The tab was pricey, but you pay for what you get and that is excellent steak. \nIt was a great experience, I'm actually dying to go back and I'd definitely recommend to anyone else."}
{"input": "The original plain fro yo! Has the right amount of tang and zip. No topping needed. Obsessed."}
{"input": "I was here a few weeks ago and this experience really stood out for my trip. Kerry was a gem, he even helped me locate the coffee shop to purchase their coffee which I fell in love with. I would definitely recommend"}
{"input": "Probably the best place to go for burgers and fries in this area. The quality fluctuates a little, this is why the 4 stars. Finally they added milkshakes!  And they are good! Simple concept good food lively atmosphere."}
{"input": "Don't bother to place an order in person.  With no other customers in the store I had to wait over five mins just before the guy would slowly walk around to the cash register to say, \"you didn't call it in\".  Which really upset me cause that means that there were no other Orders beside the one that he was slowly making while I waited."}
{"input": "Great and authentic Vietnamese food in lower garden district. Delicious vegan pho and many other options for vegans -which is hard to find in Nola! Awesome service. Very attentive. This place is pho-nomenal !!!!"}
{"input": "I would eat here again, but mostly because it is an interesting destination in a town with a lot of bad restaurants. Great decor, noisy atmosphere, and funky vibe. Servers seem hip, but we were rushed through an inattentive service. (One of those dinners where you better ask for the check when you can because you don't know when you will see the waiter again). Note to Gluten Free folks, this place is not completely safe or knowledgeable and the GF buns were awful. The house catsup, which is apparently a thing here, is not GF. Note to anyone with a car: parking sucks."}
{"input": "Wendy, the owner, and her colleague, Corey, came over to Philadelphia to help us unpack, organize, and arrange a new live/work space that we are opening.  We had a bunch of furniture that needed to be assembled as well as piles of boxes that needed to be unpacked and dealt with.\n\nThey did a great job.  One thing that I really liked about working with Wendy is that she is very responsive in her communications.  I contacted her via email and she replied the same day and in all of our back-forth emails and phone calls, I never had a communications issue with her.  I point this out because too often, service providers, who are great with their services, are not great with their communications.  Wendy and Corey were prompt, efficient, and super friendly.  I would definitely use them again and I absolutely recommend their services."}
{"input": "This place is atrocious. The food made me sick. My boyfriend and I got the sushi for two and nothing was fresh. At all. The service was even worse. The guy refused to split our check. So bad, we went to chick-fil-a after. Overall, do not come here unless you want to live in the bathroom for the night."}
{"input": "Amazing. We had; Steak Tartare, Caribbean Seafood Pepper Pot and the Curried Goat. Everything was really wonderful. Tartare maybe the best i've had. The goat with the sweet curry and gnocchi was very different and I loved it. I had a bite of the lime cheesecake and it was top notch, too. \n\nNo drinks, because it's 2 days after Mardi Gras and I'm still in recovery mode. The service was among the best I've had in this town, which is know for it's hospitality industry. Great great great!"}
{"input": "Stayed at the Independent with 3 friends and were extremely satisfied!  Got in for a great price, the room was more than enough space, and the bathroom was just as spacious.  Continental breakfast was great - they have a great spread in the lobby!  Walking distance to a lot of major sites.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and anyone looking for a boutique hotel in Philly."}
{"input": "This is the best Pasta House location I've been to in St. Louis.  The service has always been good (and sometimes really fun when we've had Jessica wait on us) and the food consistent and delicious.  I don't expect fancy or special event food when I go, you can go to several nice places on The Hill for that, but I always enjoy my meal here and that it is a good value.  Promotions like 2.99 cheese garlic bread are offered and I've never been turned down for special requests like extra meat sauce in a to-go box.  I'd recommend the chicken flamingo.  I've had one incident where the food had an issue, and the server quickly and in a friendly way made it right.  The manager also made the effort to come over to follow up and talk with us.  Overall, can't go wrong with good service, enjoyable food that they stand behind and good value."}
{"input": "Amazing Bagels!! My favorite place ever! Super fast cook and donuts are fresh and they taste so good!"}
{"input": "Oh. Mi. Gawd.  Eat. HERE!!!  Don't pass go. Don't collect $200. Eat. HERE!!!!  \nThe bacon is to die for!!  The brûlée-d grapefruit - please can I have this every morning!!!  I got the fig & prosciutto toast. It's all soo soo soo good!!  I don't love breakfast but I may have changed my mind. The wait is a bit long but it is WORTH EVERY freaking second. \nTry the champagne mojito for a nice refreshing twist on mimosas!!!  \nEat here - have you figured out yet that your mouth and your belly will dance?!?!   Eat. Here!!!!"}
{"input": "2 for 1 House Margaritas, good service, & tasty food...hard to beat. I'm an Ex-Texan who loves TexMex & great margaritas & I wasn't disappointed. I had the cheesy chimichanga & was delighted with the ridiculous amount of cheese! My rice & refried beans were yummy, too. I don't even mind paying for the chips & salsa,"}
{"input": "(3.5) ~ Overall Food & Service\n\nMY MENU\n* Oreo Malt Shake = (4) very good\n* Fries = (3.5) good\n* Burger = (3) ok...too salty:-("}
{"input": "Excellent.  Went there for lunch (the budget option).  Prix fixe menu was tempting.  Wife had the prime rib po'boy with the soup of the day (tomato fennel).  Both were excellent (the po'boy being an upscale interpretation, with gruyere and a really good horseradish sauce).  I had the seafood jamabalaya and seafood gumbo, also excellent (probably the best I've had)."}
{"input": "Hey! This is the best place I have ever eaten at in New Orleans and quite possibly one of the best meals of my life. I have been to New Orleans numerous times and thankfully this time I have a \"local\" to roll with and this little number blew my fucking mind. I could sit here and describe it to you but it will ruin it for you. Just trust me go, eat, and have an \"if I die after this it's okay\" type of night."}
{"input": "Clean restaurant with quick and friendly service. \nToday is the 60tg anniversary and they're offering 60¢ pancakes as a special. Food is fresh and prepared quickly. \nGetting to the restaurant is a bit difficult as it is on a road with a lot of traffic, and parking is less than ideal for space. It is a bit crowded. \nOverall a good experience."}
{"input": "I used to live out in the Tampa Bay area and as far as casinos go there isn't much of a selection, but this casino is by far the best! It's glamour and shine lives up to the name of HardRock.They have a huge guitar in front at the entrance that is really cool. Plus they have a huge poker room that is mighty inviting to those looking to play some cards.Definitely a must stay and play if you are in the area!"}
{"input": "this place has the most amazing sushi i have ever tasted. the rolls are unique and you can't find them elsewhere. the bill will be high, but it is so worth it. this is one of the places i miss the most because i have moved back to the bay area. and even with the unlimited sushi places here, i doubt i will ever find a place like Sakana. \n\nhowever, if you ever order take out, make sure to check the box. once, i was given someone else's order, but luckily i checked before i drove away. they gave me a complimentary edamame :-)."}
{"input": "Great food!  Great Prices!  And above all Great Customer Service.  Favorite was the Al Pastor Strert Taco.  Added Bonus was the Salsa Bar."}
{"input": "Hayley is a great server and the food is wonderful.  I love a great vegan friendly restaurant."}
{"input": "Great drinks, service was on time with complimentary ice cream on the house before we left. Bombay misbehavior is a MUST TRY drink."}
{"input": "The parking was fairly poor, but its understandable because the place was packed. The wait time was pretty short, considering the large number of people there. The air conditioning was pretty bad, but cool enough to not be sweating. The food was AMAZING. The snow crab was very high quality, as were the fries. And the customer service was decent, as was the cleanliness."}
{"input": "By far the best brunch in Tucson. One of the rare places that serves a Bloody Mary with a beer back.  Service is consistently great. Expect a wait Friday-Sunday. Order the Benedict and the Madras mimosa."}
{"input": "Amazing food, cheap and BYOB. Come early to avoid the lines. I would recommend the curry mussels for apetizer!"}
{"input": "I finally tried this place tonight. It was very quiet. Which i love when i want to carry a conversation. Josh was our server, what a great guy, on the ball, very informative, no is not in hos vocabulary.  Got mussels marinara as an app.  I have never seen so many mussels on 1 plate. I swear it must have been 3 lbs. And they were all as plump. All of our food huge portions and delish. Dessert was over the top. Its my new fav. Italian restaurant. Cant wait to go back"}
{"input": "Decent, quick serve food. Certainly not gourmet, but it is Taco Bell. Got me in and out fairly quick!\n\nThree star experience taken down to two because of dirty bathrooms."}
{"input": "My husband and I have been to this dinner quit a few times and not once have we ever been disappointed. The food is good, the pies are delightful and the cost is never too high. The waitresses are very friendly and we always tip them Well."}
{"input": "Lunch was yummy. The sweet tots were delicious. The service was good, very attentive staff and very courteous! Soooooo mannnny options!!!!!"}
{"input": "Visited on 12/16/14\nWe have tried this restaurant location under various management.  So when we saw it was open once again, under a new name we wanted to give it a chance.  We will not be going back.  We did get carry out, so we gave some slack on the mushy, greasy onion rings, and the Texas toast.  But my husband ordered the brisket and rib platter and I ordered the 1/2 chicken.  The ribs were just ok, the brisket was an end piece and was burned and inedible.  The chicken was more the size of a Cornish game hen and had little meat.  They gave 2 small containers of BBQ sauce which was not enough.  We both asked for cole slaw, but got potato salad.  The cowboy beans were watery.  \n\nIt is one of the closest restaurants to us, so we wanted it to be good, but we will not be returning."}
{"input": "My wife and I really like this place. Today was the first time we have eaten their, it won't be the last. We got the #49 which was a 3 meat dish with rice. It's made for 2 people and we had leftovers to bring home. The food was very good. The 3 meats were all cooked just right. Everything had a great taste as well. Their is a spice on the table to use on anything you wish. It was also enjoyable. The bottle of wine we got was very good and priced very fairly. The waitress was attentive and the rest of the employees were all nice people. The inside of the restaurant is clean and pleasant. We thought it inviting. We also had Turkish coffee and ice cream after dinner that was a nice end to a enjoyable dinner."}
{"input": "Amazing all-around experience at Jiallo's. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted warmly. We ordered the jerk chicken and curry chicken with rice and beans and plantains and the food was all excellent. If you're looking for a new food experience, try Jiallo's!"}
{"input": "i was staying at the lovely Hotel Monaco (to which this bar is connected to) and figured that I would give this place a try.  The vibe is just a little uptight.  A bit like a sports bar.  I attempted to venture upstairs when I was accosted by a very tall, very bald doorman who looked like he was going to burst a blood vessel as he brusquely steered me away from that area, explaining that it was only for diners.  Ok Max Headroom!  Get your prescription changed."}
{"input": "Went here for dinner on opening day and was SO HAPPY I DID!! Great atmosphere, lovely staff, and food on fleek!! Green tea (PHO PHREE) was so satisfying, summer rolls and spicy peanut sauce were DELISH, and pho was PHONOMENAL! Definitely making this one of my regular hot spotz as I eat my way through Fairmount!"}
{"input": "Don't like the decoration. It looks like a fast food place instead of a sit down restaurant. I ordered lamb curry and it was tasty."}
{"input": "Solid improvement since last visit.  \n\nService- much improved.  Kid named Dillon gave a great service.  \n\nAmbiance is very casual.  Order and sit, they bring food to you. \n\nFood- tasty and lots of options.  Not fancy.  Very affordable.  \n\nFamily of four for about 30$.  That's a great deal w today's prices. \n\nIf you are looking for a fast, casual Asian option, give this place a try."}
{"input": "All things get better with time!  I have come here off an on since they started the business.  \n\nIf your new - sampler for 2 - 2nd option best way to get a variety and taste the food.  \n\nIf slow they have a great coffee ceremony. TEA is very tasty too!  Honey wine is good too but I have not had it at this location.\n\nIf your looking to share or take some home I suggest these tasty additions:  \nKITFO - a sirloin ground typically eaten rare but you can (and I do) ask for it med or med well.  \nSHIRO - num num num\n\nAll the meat dishes are fantastic in my experience so if your looking at another meat option explore, they do meat well at this place!  \n\nI order sample for two plus all the sided dishes listed for 4 people - we ate most of it.  \n\nCaution to those who are not spicy food fans - to me this place is VERY tame in the spicy department but I have heard others who cannot handle a mouth full of flamey goodness to exclaim, this is a little spicy."}
{"input": "I walked in here not knowing where I was going or what kind of food they would have to offer, very late around 1am on a Friday night & boy am i glad I did! SO DELICIOUS! I had the Doner Berlin with chicken and added Chickpeas and lettuce to it (along with the cabbage, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, feta & cucumbers that come on the doner already)...IT WAS INCREDIBLE!!! They call this a \"sandwich\" but this is like a gigantic pita only it has a more bread like yet crispy texture. The spicy tzatziki sauce it comes with was so good I had to get more on the side! \n\nI can't wait to come back and try something else!"}
{"input": "I wish I still had the photo of the dish I had for lunch, it was so beautiful I had to take a phone picture.  By far the best Thai restaurant I've been to.  The interior is small, but interesting and clean."}
{"input": "While visiting the beach we found this restaurant nearby. The atmosphere was inviting and the colors really gave it a Florida vibe! It was busy during the lunch hour but wait times were minimal. We asked to sit outside but the bugs were so bad we decided to move to the inside seating. The staff was accommodating and very helpful. The food was delicious and we got a lot for a good price. We loved it so much we went back a second night! Will recommend this place and if in the area again will go back."}
{"input": "I purchased some shoes here for my brother and he absolutely loved them. They sell the most comfortable running shoes and the prices were very reasonable. I don't mind buying good quality items for a reasonable price. I also enjoyed how the customer service was so nice. The guy that helped me was very patient and took his time to help me and give me his opinion. The cashier was also very sweet."}
{"input": "I did a lot of research for fence businesses to compare quality, honesty, and professionalism. I chose Prince's Fences to install a privacy fence. Chuck, the owner, is easy to work with. He leaves his contact number and is very quick to return calls. I was impressed with Chuck and his team. Each one knowledgable, professional, and friendly. Give Prince's Fences consideration when you want consider fencing. I appreciate, too, that he answered all my questions concerning different options and why one fence might be better over another. Good job, Prince's Fences! Thank you."}

{"input": "We had been driving around for some time, on a weekday last week.  This was our last time in town, as we had sold our home in Alton.  So, after going to 3 different restaurants and finding that they are closed for various reasons, we decided we would come here.  WOW,  Seriously, everything happens for a reason, and WOW.   We were maybe one of the first patrons in the restaurant upon opening.  The ambiance is lovely.  We were greeted warmly initially, and the warmness continued throughout our visit.  As I said prior, the ambiance is lovely, the decor is SO just want to take it home.  The service was impeccable, our waitress was attentive, friendly, knowledgeable, and smiley.  OMG. The food.  THE FOOD!!!!  We had their summer special .  Holy COW, were they fantastic!  Entrees were   seafood shrimp Alfredo and our friend and I had the steak.  Honestly, you cannot go wrong with anything that you order from Tony's.  Top notch, old school dining experience, which is RARE."}
{"input": "Below average Chinese food priced accordingly. This is fine but the front counter lady is among the rudest I have ever dealt with. Unwelcoming and cold is putting it lightly. The House Special is fine if you're struggling with the base of Maslow's hierarchy pyramid, otherwise don't bother."}
{"input": "No doubt this is one of the best restaurants in the city.\n\nFood:\nI had the pleasure of trying the grand tasting menu and it was well worth every penny.  I tried Hallibut for the first time here and I was really impressed with the flavor and texture of the fish.  Get the foie gras you won't regret it.  Seriously the best food in the city.\n\nService:\nOur waitress looked like Anne Hathaway and she was really nice.  They strive to make sure you enjoy their food.  At one point she noticed that we didn't like the goat that was served as our 6th course - even though we said it was okay somehow she knew we didn't like it (I think they bugged our table).  They actually gave us an extra course of the Hallibut to make up for it - which was awesome.\n\nAmbience:\nThe restaurant is in a row home on Spruce street.  It's got an old feel to it and is prefect for a dinner date.  It's fancy."}
{"input": "These 5 stars are strictly for the Chicken and Waffles!  It's the only thing I've eaten there...cause when I go there I can't think of anything else to get., I taste the Chicken and Waffles while looking for parking!\n\nHere's a suggestion...you can take that gravy and seal some loose wallpaper with it...butter and syrup will do just fine....\n\nOne thing....do you serve a half a waffle so we will ask for the second half and have to pay for it?  Come on!!!!\n\nNow....back to the Chicken part of the Chicken and Waffles....\n\nI am ashamed to write that my family made a pig of themselves by ordering more chicken and more waffles....\n\nBut looking back...it I wasn't so embarressed, I would have done the same!"}

{"input": "We tried to go here on a Sunday night before a concert.  Got there at 6:30 were on the no wait app.  Said it would be 40 minutes max. We left at 7:40 had not been seated and was told the kitchen was behind.  The last time I was here it took a long time to get our food.  I do not recommend this establishment."}
{"input": "Like wholefoods but much smaller. They have all sorts of stuff from Salad bar, to a small selection of fresh fruits, juice bar. Great lil grocery store. Couldn't really find any other in the city. They have a parking lot. Great walking, just a couple blocks from clothing stores"}
{"input": "Went here on Xmas eve or Xmas day and it was one of the only places open. This is not a fancy place, just a very simple family restaurant/diner.  We were suprised to see options that were only 5.95 whether they were breakfast options, or different chicken, pork, or pasta options. With it, you had choices of sides, and got a dessert. It was a really good deal, and it was tasty, and considering the price not bad at all. Again, not a fancy place, but a decent place for a stop for some food, and better than just a greasy fast food place."}
{"input": "This place is good~  The chicken is moist, the skin is crispy, the flavor is nice and smokey, this is the best kind of roast chicken I have tried. The smells (smokey, bbq) is so good and hypnotizing, just make my mouth water.  I got the double chicken family which is 2 whole chickens, literally a bed of fries underneath them, and cole slaw.  It was more than enough to feed a family of four.  The dipping sauces that come with it are also real good, i really like the mustard base one, its kinda mustardy with a chipotle flair, and there is also a green sauce that is like a salsa.  The fries are wedge fries and they make you real full because there are plenty to go around. We had leftovers because the meal was that big.  I would rather eat here than popeyes or kfc, because you get more, its healthier, and you get better service. The owners are real nice and friendly. I will be back because I know I will be craving this chicken."}
{"input": "I had the Porterhouse there and it was great.  Perfectly cooked at medium rare.  The spouse had the filet mignon and she didn't enjoy her piece of meat as much as I did.  The filet was a little overcooked for medium rare.  The lobster mac and the sweet potato fries were good though.  \n\nSurprisingly, the service was fast.  The food came out pretty quick.  Nice choice for a steakhouse in St. Louis County."}
{"input": "Had a falafel wrap here a few years ago. Not bad, so tried it again today. No flavor, except extreme saltiness! The falafels & pita = no flavor. I was hoping the tzatziki sauce would pull it all together, nope! It had no flavor either. It wasn't like the sauce you'd imagine, but more like a thin tasteless glue. Only good part about the wrap were the fresh diced cucumber & tomato, too bad that was underneath the icky white sauce that doesn't even deserve to be called tzatziki : ("}
{"input": "Look, I like the place and featured donuts did not disappoint.  But lets be honest with a line like that, how does a selfie happen?  Huh?  St. Louis?  Huh?  Strange Donuts?  I find that a little unusual and now my near perfect selfie-foursquare check in ratio has been irreconcilably tarnished so I'm taking a star off because selfie in the age of Mark Zuckerberg, in the age of Obama you're gonna have a shop too crowded to take a decent selfie?  PALEESE.  Also they have no paleo/gluten free options so another star off, I mean WHAT THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO FEED MY FOUR AND SIX YEAR OLD?!"}
{"input": "I'm writing this review solely based on the fact that I am sitting here at 2 am on a Sunday night craving Sushiya (mind you, I graduated two years ago). I just love their IV roll & miso soup SO much! It's not your best quality sushi restaurant by any means, but it is damn good."}
{"input": "Not exactly sure why this service calls itself Reno-Tahoe Shuttle when it does not service Reno...just tried to book a ride from the RENO-TAHOE AIRPORT and apparently this is out of their pick up area.

{"input": "Chef's Market has a great variety of food.  It's convenient to where I live so we eat here on a regular basis.  Everything I've had here has been excellent.  If you don't see anything you like in the case, they have a great cheeseburger as well. \n\nThe deserts are great too.  Their German Chocolate cake is the best I've ever had."}
{"input": "My Wife & I have been wanting to visit Fiamme's since it's inception, but due to it's limited hours and the distance to drive from So AZ, it never happened.\nSO, when we had a Stay-cation in the Foot Hills, we jumped at the opportunity dine @ Fiamme's.\nIt is located in a strip mall.  A long, deep and narrow venue with few tables; much reminiscent of Hanover Street in the Nahth End of Boston!\nThe store is immaculate and the help is uber friendly.\nWe got a simple Caprese salad that was divine, as was the bread served with it.\nThe 13\" Carne pizza was amazing!  Several types of meats, a bit of cheese and a scant dolep of red gravy on a dough pie that literally puffed up around the outside into an airy, slightly burnt crust.\nThe Owner, Mr. Scott Volpi was interacting with the customers as well as his staff.  He is a very personable young man! We wish him well!\nAs I told him on the way out, my only regret is that we didn't come up from SE AZ sooner; we've been missing A LOT!"}
{"input": "I recently bought $50 worth of hair products I was specifically looking for.  While I looked three salespeople were in a conversation a few aisles away.  When I was walking toward the cashier, one asked if I needed any help.  Yes about ten minutes ago!  The first thing the cashier asked me was, \"What's your phone number?\"  Really?  No \"hello\", have you found everything you were looking for?\"  I responded it was unlisted. She looked panicked and told me it didn't go anywhere.  Then why ask?  She then asked me if I had a daughter?  I could give her phone number.  OMG, totally inappropriate question.  Besides if I'm not giving you my phone number why would I give you my daughter's she assumed I had?  I told her I don't give out personal information.  \n\nI most likely will continue shopping there, but please stop this policy of asking customers for their phone numbers!!"}
{"input": "Our favorite. Food is always consistently good, service is spot on....not to be missed. We love it!"}
{"input": "Okay, we were off to a bad start.  Party of 9 (4 adults & 5 kids ages 8-12).  It wasn't packed ( but we were packed in a kind of wrap around booth).  \n\nWe were there an hour before our food was served.  The waitress kept up with drink refills and apologies.  5-stars for her!\n\nWhen the food finally arrived it was hot and impressive in both taste and presentation.  The burgers were mile-high with toppings, and the kids meals satisfied our big kids. I would say worth the wait but that wait was way too long with no visit from the management.   \n\nI'll come back for the Cowboy Burger and hope for the best."}
{"input": "I went in for a manicure and I will not be coming back. I walked in and immediately wanted to leave. It was so uncomfortably hot and stuffy. As I was choosing the color the girl came up to me and asked if I was ready. Less than a minute later she comes up to me again and asks if I'm ready. So rude. \nWhen I did sit down for the manicure, she did not take good care of me. She barely used the nippers on my cuticles or skin and filed my nails crooked. Then she left half way through my manicure to do three eyebrow waxings. As if this weren't bad enough, she got polish on my fingers and missed a sizable amount on my pinkies.\nI will not be returning to this establishment and I hope you will not either. Go to LyLy's across the highway. Better customer service and quality manicure!"}
{"input": "Cool place to go I remember going as a kid. Wish they would've had woman's pink camo stuff though!"}
{"input": "Totally agree with the other lone (and 1st) review, the staffing at this store is dysfunctional and the merchandising is poor at best.   And, to make matters worse many of the center-store packaged product prices are not competitive to other merchants in the area.\n\nThere are some perks, if you live nearby it's of course convenience.  The other nice perk is that Lancaster brand steaks are very good and at this Acme they're always fresh, good grill cuts, and they are very reasonably priced."}
{"input": "People have been recommending we try this place for years.  We finally stopped in this weekend for the Sunday Brunch.  The location and setting are beautiful.  The Sunday brunch costs about $33 per person, and it includes a buffet, made to order menu, and unlimited mimosas.  The price is great for the amount of food; however, the quality of the food was just above average.  The servers continually brought out the wrong orders to our table, and we waited 20 minutes after being seated before our server came over to the table.  If I am going to be in the area for brunch, I would prefer to pay $55 per person for Oystercatchers, where the quality of food and service is much higher, and the setting is equally beautiful."}
{"input": "The food here is really incredible. I had the fried chicken in a bag and it was delicious! The menu offers a nice twist on southern comfort food. I love the decor and the service is excellent. Our waiter Adam was friendly and attentive and thoroughly explained the menu to us. We had a bunch of desserts but my favorite was the chocolate pecan pie with BACON ICECREAM! Yes! I highly recommend this place. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"input": "We went here in spite of terrible reviews and a friend claiming to have become sick after eating here. The food and staff were both excellent! We definitely plan to return again soon."}
{"input": "Buckingham Pizza makes the best pizza around, particularly its plain pizza and a few of its specialities -- try the cool ranch pizza. This is a pizza parlor. Don't get fancy....order the pizzas and maybe some sides. While some of the entrees are good (chicken piccata), stay with the pizza and you'll love it."}
{"input": "Joey V is amazing! His precision and talent are some of the best I've seen in men's styling. He listens and talks with you through your cut making sure he understands your needs and gives great suggestions on styles and products. His fades are perfect! I highly recommend Joey V. His positive attitude and fun personality make getting my haircut fun and enjoyable too. He's awesome."}
{"input": "Voted one of the most romantic restaurants in Santa Barbara. It could have been if it wasn't for a wedding reception when we went... There were kids running and place was very loud. Not the restaurant's fault, of course.\n\nFood is just OK.. nothing spectacular.. I need a redo."}
{"input": "My girlfriend loves the food here. We come at minimum once a month and the food is always very fresh and filling."}
{"input": "We walked in off the street looking to see a doctor. There was no doctor in that day but we got to see the PA. She was friendly and efficient. After examining us, she prescribed medications and sent us on our way. We would go back again if needed."}

{"input": "My boyfriend and I came to Ybor city and stumbled upon this place. When we walked in, we noticed the Galaga/Ms Pacman table was just getting cleaned up. WHAT? So we sat there. He kicked my butt at Galaga and Ms Pacman, and I still love this place! Great live music. I would recommend just getting some mixed drinks (I had 2 Bombay Tonic, he had 1 Johnnie Walker black on the rocks) Bill was $25 before tip. Not bad considering the awesome live music and game table! The service was ok, not the best but not the worst. I see a lot of reviews of this place and it seems like some of the issues could be resolved if you order drinks like I recommend instead of the frozen drinks. Cheaper, enjoy the great music, and less of a hangover. Win/win/win?"}
{"input": "Brooke's music needs to go. No more pop edm."}
{"input": "Incredible service and food. I ordered the filet/shrimp combo with lobster Mac & cheese and brussel sprouts as sides. Everything was delicious!"}
{"input": "I have only ever gotten take-out at the Bridgeport Rib House, so I can only comment on that.  After numerous visits, the short story is that the food is pretty good, the prices are fair, and picking up one's order in the bar is poor.\n\nBarbecue on par with this can be had elsewhere in the area, without the weak service experience."}
{"input": "Awesomeeeee place. Came here with friends at 5:30ish for dinner to beat the crowds. The place is so cute and we loved the logo. We were seated immediately. The waitress was superrrrr friendly and helpful. We got the cheese platter called Ben's bread spread to split for the appetizer. Ohmggggg soooo tasty. Homemade honey and delicious cheeses and the bread was excellent. It was out of this world and worth getting. My sister and I then split the pizza with the spicy Bianca pizza. We couldn't even finish it all after that appetizer. Sooo delicious with the peppers and cheese and thin crust. We also couldn't resist getting a whoopie pie and brownie for the road. This place is a gem!"}
{"input": "Definitely dug this place...rather hipster-ish and way, way reminiscent of Este Sugarhouse in Salt Lake, but I liked it a lot despite all that...pizza here is definitely a lot better, as is beer selection. This may wind up being one of my more regular haunts as I slog my way through more of their menu (I think I may need to heavily modify next time I'm there), but so far, I have no cause at all for complaint and much to celebrate. It's interesting to me that the environments of the various locations are different, sometimes vastly, yet all have their own unique and innate charm. Whoever is running these is doing a phenomenal job, so props there.\n\nOne thing of note here...the ordering system is extremely clunky and seemingly disorganized and I sort of dislike it. Not enough to stop coming here, since I really dig the vibe of these, but on one of my less patient nights, that sort of thing may be enough to cut this out of the running. Definitely a good spot for pizza and a brew (or several), though. I back it."}
{"input": "I live in Hawaii and came to Philly for vacation. Came here before and the Gumbo is Great. My g/friend sat next to me with food from another vendor. (Plenty of Open Seats). Female waitress observed this, nothing said. So she opens the wrapping to eat and female (now) advised she couldn't eat other food at their area. (Even though I was still eating my Gumbo) I understand the concept however their were plenty of open seats. So I hurried eating my Gumbo so I could sit with my g/friend. No Aloha"}
{"input": "Literally the most racist restaurant I have ever been into in my life. The manager was as unprofessional as the teenagers running the register. I literally waited for 5 minutes to be called to a register for my order with no one else on any lines. Not sure if it was my skin tone but wow I had another experience that made my suspicions facts after paying a second order and being passed over by 3 other customers who ordered after me. I only ordered a kids nuggets. Terrible everything"}
{"input": "Good food and friendly service! I love that they had lots of healthy options. My friend had veggie sausage - she said it was so good she wondered if it was really veggie! Lol. Great service from cute waiters!  It was worth the wait on a crowded Saturday morning."}
{"input": "Tria was a fun place for a bottle of wine and some cheese.  I would definitely recommend it as a relaxing place to unwind with friends after a work day."}
{"input": "Just walked out of this place.  When we got there the wait staff was all outside and we were the first people in there restaurant. We sat down they gave us water and then never came back. We waited 20 minutes again we were the only people here and NO ONE came and even asked us if we wanted a drink. We finally left without ordering after waiting the 20 minutes only to have a couple walk in sit down and have a waitress come up and start taking their order. Horrible service. This was our first time here and I wouldn't come back. @Nick from the blue duck  if you are at work now then you were one of the people who did this and yes it's unacceptable."}
{"input": "This is a pretty fun indie American food place. We tried a bunch of their wings. Some were very good and others were interesting. My lips are still chapped from the four alarm wings, the PBJ wings were interesting to try, and I liked the signature Scooter wings named for the place's gator mascot. Boon hangs out here all the time you will probably run into him if you stop by. Otherwise it's pretty fun."}
{"input": "I have no idea what these people are talking about. This place is disgusting. I'm from San Antonio Texas, so I know what \n Mexican food is supposed to taste like. I'm not expecting New Orleans to have outstanding Mexican food, but this place is completely gross. Eat at your own risk."}
{"input": "Heather was my waitress and a bartender.\nEverything I tried was fabulous.\nI had tenderloin sliders with the french fries oh my.\nGod I will be going back here as often as I possibly can\n\nYou will not regret trying this place"}
{"input": "We have been here three times, and each time have had to send back a burger that was way overcooked.  The replacement burgers have all been good, but that means one person is done eating by the time the other person is not even started yet.  They claim to have the best burgers, but I guess not the best cooks.\n\nThe atmosphere is cool, the beer garden one of the best around.  I want to come back and have an experience that makes me give them a better rating."}
{"input": "This theater seriously needs to check on the customers. I've been here three times the past 6 months and I'm fed up. I'm never coming again. I'm always in a theater with someone that doesn't know the true meaning of a whisper. So now I'm subject to know why this teen can't be out to late and I have to keep my rage caged or risk going to jail for beating the crap out of some imbecile who doesn't have manners."}
{"input": "I was happy his was my first experience with Nola food and not my last, started on a low point. First, I understand it was Sunday night before Fat Tuesday and our waitress was working back to back 12 shifts. However, my drink order was forgotten, and my friends plate was mixed up. For my food, I had the po'boy shrimp and was underwhelmed, there was a hardy serving of shrimp but there was minimal lettuce or sauce and the fries were weak, many soggy. Needless to say, we didn't go back. From other reviews seems like we caught them on an off-day but unfortunately the result is a lack luster review."}
{"input": "Schlafly Bottleworks is more than just a microbrewery. Yes, they do brew their own beer onsite (tours are available) and they have a nice bar area with plenty of seating.\n\nThey also have great, affordable food. I'm a big fan of their burgers, but have never ordered anything at Schlafly's that I didn't like. They also have a large outside patio area and sponsor a weekly farmer's market during the summer on their parking lot.\n\nI appreciate that they use local sustainable food and that the entire building was smoke free (even the bar) before the smoking ban went into place. They keep a fire going outside all winter in the patio space which gives the smokers a warm place to huddle. \n\nI've also been to several events with the back room with it's own bar and their bartenders will let you taste the beer until you find one you like."}
{"input": "I have dealt with many dealers and am as about as picky as a customer can be when it comes to cars/service.  I have dealt with Tina Smith buying 3 Lexus's [after BMW chased me away] and every transaction has been super.  I like fast easy paperwork, no sales BS, and loaner cars with easy service.  Tom Wood Lexus gets 4.5 stars for their great service."}
{"input": "I could write a lengthy review, persuasive and layered to hit all the right points. But why do that when Lee How Fook makes food that does it for you? Long story short they have some of the best general tso chicken I have eaten to date. Try it for yourself and get back at me. - Coolie"}
{"input": "Yelp led us astray this time. Not even close to 4 stars. We went for dinner - alligator bites, crab claws, panko-breaded redfish, crawfish etoufee. The redfish was delicious, but the crab claws and crawfish were few and far between and cooked almost into oblivion. A $12 martini was little more than fruit juice. The restaurant itself was sadly worn and less than clean - just go somewhere else."}
{"input": "I have used them for my business mail for years. They're great people and the service is excellent.  I can't recommend them highly enough."}
{"input": "If you were able to give it more than 6 stars, I would. The first exposure to the duck I had was at the beer and bacon festival where they had their tomato soup with garlic pulverized bacon. It was so good they ran out about half way through the festival. \nLast night was my first time at the actual restaurant. It was a large group so in total I tried the blue duck fries, general tso's wings, the pork roll burger, house blend burger, quack and cheese and classic Mac. If you have a large group make sure they want to share because you're going to want to try everything. It's all amazing and will make you want to come back the next day. Looking forward to trying the brunch menu.\n\nThe managers also stopped by our table since it was my friends birthday. They made sure everything was perfect and I was really impressed with the staff."}
{"input": "Every dam time we come here it's an issue!!! Either the steak isn't cooked right or hair in the plate or a piece of something in the kitchen got in the plate smh I try always giving the benefit of the doubt but this is far beyond that!!! The manager don't even care.. all he said was sorry instead of saying hey we will cook it to your liking or do you want something else instead!!! Nope he just came to the table and said oh sorry and walked away!!!!  \n\nHis name is Amonte or something like that!!! \nI don't mind paying whatever for a good meal but this is ridiculous!!!! The waitress on the hand was awesome!!!"}
{"input": "I think the trendiness of this chain, in general, has sort of faded and what you have left is the basis of this chain, which is over-priced food of a questionable quality. I wouldn't call it bad, but it's a whole lot of fried food and most of the breadings, whether it's fried pickles or okra or calamari or shrimp, are the same across all of that. The batter is fine, but it gets wearing. The coconut shrimp and hush puppies were definitely overcooked, which was kind of disappointing. Coke Zero on tap, but the mix could be better. For the price, it is also worth nothing there is a ton of food here, definitely quantity over quality. Décor is pretty cool and this is parked right along the Boise river, though it's a bit tucked away and has to be more or less sought out...probably worth hitting at least once, but there are far better local places that are more worthy of attention."}
{"input": "Mandala has everything you need for massage at great prices! Lisa is extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly. She helped me choose several different essential oils from the huge aroma bar and blended them just right for me. It was a fun, interactive experience. Mandala is very affordable, on par (if not less costly) than online prices and you get to test the products in person with no shipping charges. Please consider shopping locally for your massage supplies rather than purchasing them online in order to support this fantastic small business! Note that Mandala has moved to a quaint Victorian-style home on South Virginia."}
{"input": "Vault of Souls is a $50 cover charge to get into an over-priced bar.  The \"experience\" lasts for 20 minutes unlike the escape room.  You are rushed through and spoon-fed the answers in a pitch-black room. If you want to waste your money and buy crappy drinks, be my guest. I say SKIP IT!"}
{"input": "I'm a big fan of TBar!  I mean really, how can you not like a place that offers 50+ different kinds of loose tea - and that's not even counting the speciality drinks, fizzes, or boba (pearls in the TBar lexicon)!  It was also nice to attend the Yelp Office Hours with Carrie and the gang last night, what a great idea to get to spend a few relaxing hours with some of Philly's finest!\n\nWhat do I normally get when I go to TBar?  It really depends on the weather...  If it's warm outside, I prefer the Awake or Gin Fizz - these are herbal tea blends infused with fruit juice and mixed with sparkling water.  Very refreshing and tasty!  If it's cold outside, I prefer to get a loose tea blend like Midnight Blue or classic Oolong teas!  If you feel overwhelmed by the choices and blends - ask the staff they are very knowledgeable and extremely friendly!"}
{"input": "Costco - wholesale shopping off 86th and Michigan  Road is one of my favorite places to shop. While I don't buy many food items in bulk, their food is fresh and great quality. This place has a great selection of merchandise and what's even better is Costco stands by every item they sell. If you're not 100% happy - just return it for a full refund. No questions asked. Amazing customer service!\n\nCostco has yet to disappoint me but plan on waiting in line if you shop there during prime shopping hours especially on weekends! Best to get there when they first open to beat the crowds.\n\nCOSTCO ROCKS!! :)"}
{"input": "This place is amazing. Everyone who works here is very personable they make you feel like family. The food is fantastic the pizza is probably the best in town to completely honest. And now they have an awesome choice craft beers and wine to choose from whats not to love about this place? Highly recommended if your looking for a place to relax."}
{"input": "The Whitman sandwich was delicious. The fried oysters come on the side but I put them inside the sandwich and it tasted even better! But the beers tasted old. Overall an okay experience-much better places to visit in NOLA."}
{"input": "Found by chance and loved right away. My burrito was excellent, wrapped in a light tortilla, with a tasty and freshly made filling and perfectly cooked rice. My husband loved his tacos, one with pork and one with carnitas. Personnel was fast and courteous. We will come back!"}
{"input": "I have to admit, after reading several not-so-great reviews about this place, I was a little hesitant to try it.  However, uber-hungry fiance in the mood for Thai food outweighed my doubts, so off we went!\n\nThe restaurant is small and the tables are packed closely together.  There is a whole lot going on in terms of decoration, so it can be a bit of a sensory overload.  \n\nOverall, the service was excellent and very quick, especially considering there only appeared to be two servers for the entire dining room.  We tried a few appetizers, all ok but nothing special.  We both had dim sum, mine only mildly spicy and his quite spicy, and both enjoyed our dishes.  The bill amounted to only $34 (the restaurant is a BYOB, and no corking fee!), which was great for the amount of food that we ordered.  Not sure we'll be back any time soon, but I'm glad we tried Thai Orchid."}
{"input": "Favorite Thai in the neighborhood! Great for takeout with excellent and diverse offerings. Love ending the meal with the peanut pancake, so glad to have found this spot and the curries are rich and thick (green is my favorite) filled with more types of veggies than one usually finds. Heads and shoulders above any of the Asian spots on the South St corridor."}
{"input": "Wow - an overwhelming selection of products.\nThey are coming out for an estimate and I will update after that time.\n\nSo far, I am liking it!"}
{"input": "Today was our first visit to the cat hospital and what a wonderful experience it was! The staff was so professional and the service exemplary! Thank you!"}
{"input": "I would love to give Cyrano's 4 stars but something really rubbed me the wrong way there on my last trip, so I had to go for 3.  More below.\n\nI wasn't very hungry so I decided just to have the hummus with pita appetizer.  Wow -- big portion!  There was easily enough there for two people and it was delicious.  It tasted like there might be some roasted red peppers added in, but I'm not sure.  \n\nNow... my friend ordered the burger and the waiter told him they don't cook it below medium well. WTF?  Seriously?  I don't even remember the excuse but it was really lame.  He ordered it anyway and then wished he hadn't since it had no pink at all.  The fries were good, but very McDonald's-like.\n\nThe desserts were truly delicious.  My friend had a wonderful float made with Abita root beer and I had the bread pudding, which was so light and fluffy -- really good!   \n\nI'll probably come back and update this review because the desserts can probably overcome the stupid burger policy."}
{"input": "I've been to Nordstrom before but this was my first time at this store inside the mall. Very clean inside, lots of varieties to choose from. The men's jeans are very costly so you should take advantage of whatever sales that they have. They got some good cologne for men and women."}
{"input": "I have been to Novo four times since moving to Philadelphia and it is one of the best places I have ever gotten my hair done!  The girls that work there are really welcoming and friendly and do great work.  I had Lauren do my hair and she listened to me and did exactly what I asked and made my hair look fabulous.  \nNovo is really decently priced for such a good cut.  I was referred by a friend and they gave her $20 off her next hair cut for referring me and gave me a ton of coupons for my subsequent visits.\nIt is so easy to get an appointment here, even last minute.\nIf you're looking for a place in South Philly to get your hair cut you have to go to Novo."}
{"input": "If you go here, beware.  If the bar attended is a blond with the name of Celina, sit at a table and be waited on my someone else.  If the bar attendant is a lady named Jessica, sit at the bar and enjoy the best bartender that I have ever had in my fifty years of drinking.  She will never let you run out of beer.  And the owner opened a bar in Murfreesboro, so his appearances here are few and far between.   Jennifer is the daytime barkeep and also manages the place in the owner's absence.  She does a good job of it, but Celina and one other person behind the bar would never work for me."}
{"input": "Visited last night with a group of six. Ambiance and service was excellent, they've done a great job with the space. The salsa and table side guacamole are very good. However the three stars are attributed to less than spectacular entrees that are slightly over priced (for Mexican food) and everyone in our group had drinks that were all consistently weak (i.e. tasted like less than an ounce of alcohol). I would give 3.5 stars if possible, but I see this as a second or third option in the Tampa area for Mexican cuisine."}
{"input": "Only tried donuts from here recently when my coworker brought some back.  On the website, they had some interesting flavors.  The donuts at softer since they are fresh.  My coworker said they moved slow in there and he had to wait a bit.  The donuts I had in the office were nothing special.  They were different but nothing about them really jumped out.  I'd actually be ok eating my store bought donut."}
{"input": "This is a decent Mediterranean place.\n\nThe food was nothing special; honestly your run of the mill Mediterranean food. \n\nThe area is kind of spotty and we almost drove past the place the first time, but the inside is nice enough."}
{"input": "This was my second time coming here. The first time was before I got into yelp so I can't really go into too much detail about that experience. I do remember enjoying it and the margaritas. Anyways, I came here recently on a Thursday night with a group of work people. We had a few issues making reservations. When we called we told them we are a party of about 10 and she said that she would have to double check and get back to us, which she never did. We called back and she said that she would have to check with the General Manager because they have quizzo on Thursday nights. We finally got reservations squared away though! And we got seated at two separate tables next to each other. \n\nMy steak tacos were good, nothing special. The margaritas though... I enjoyed all 4 of them! For dessert I shared some dessert nachos those were pretty tasty. \n\nIf you are going here with a large group definitely make reservations and they may need to split you up."}
{"input": "Best pho place in town! Their food was delicious and customer service was excellent. I just loved how friendly everyone was!"}
{"input": "Not pet friendly which is quite odd since it's a \"farm\", although no signs state such a thing.. Everyone was friendly except for one old bat cashier. I assume she was some type of manager making sure nobody was going to leave with a smile on their face.."}

{"input": "The food ranks 3 stars but the service ranks only 1/2 star, dragging the over-all star rating down to a sub-zero number. \n\nI walked up to the counter, was looked at (though not acknowledged) and, after a span of time what seemed eternal, asked by a gal standing far back from the counter, \"Do you need something?\" \n\n\"Food!\" I answered. Yep. Food. \n\nShe continued on with what she was doing: the grueling task of flipping tortillas on a grill. I full expected the woman's head to twist a complete 360 degrees, a trick I once saw in the movie \"The Exorcist\". If I had been wearing a cross around my neck I think she no doubt would have begun to manifest, as her eyes were by this time rolling in their sockets and back into her head.\n\nI promise not to bother you again...."}
{"input": "Went there for first time and had a buffet which for price is not bad considering the quantity of items served but quality wise it's not good at all in my opinion. I tried everything but really didn't like anything and specially I was eager to try the deserts kheer and gulab jamun and they were most terrible. I'm giving three starts because the manager was attentive and was doing his job very nice nicely. The restaurant is under renovation they are making it more appealing but in my opinion food quality and taste must be improved. Sorry for the bitter truth but writing this review in only hope that they improve. Good Luck!"}
{"input": "Just left this awesome place & can't say enough about the helpfulness & fun the staff is.  Wish I had time to hang out & try some varying vape juice.....next time.  Keep up the great a job that you guys do.  Anxious to try the new flavor you were working on (yummy)"}
{"input": "Not up to Starr quality. Calmari was soggy, oily. Diner food at 5 times diner prices. Won't go back."}
{"input": "As hotel restaurants go, this place was very satisfying. For the 3 days that we stayed here at the Blake Hotel, we ate breakfast, came in for drinks, for coffee, and for appetizers. Pretty much everything that we ordered and tried was good. I have to give a shout out for a few things that we indulged in - one was the rum punch during happy hour, which is only $5. They have great mozzarella sticks that come with a marinara sauce and a ranch sauce for dipping. The gumbo, though not outstanding, was very good. For breakfast one morning, I got the 3 egg omelette and I chose to stuff it with andouille sausage and pepper jack cheese. It was delicious. The breakfast came with a side order of creamy grits and a biscuit."}

{"input": "Great food and nice service. My husband and I went with another couple and brought a bottle of white wine (no corking fee). We ordered vegetarian - a super yummy paneer tikka masala and another very good dish - I think it was the alu gobi.\n\nThe ambiance is nice and pretty formal-ish. At least for dinner, it's one of those places you could feel comfortable dressing up pretty well or coming in with jeans and a decent shirt.\n\nYou don't get super massive portions: my husband and I shared two main dishes and only had a little bit left. But I thought it was a good price. Their menu is online if you Google it.\n\nI've eaten Indian in a fair number of different places - homemade and in restaurants - and was happy with this place. It certainly isn't the best I've had, but it's better than OK. I'd recommend it, and I'll go back with friends."}
{"input": "Sport Cycle Pacific maintenance my Ninja. They have done several upgrades for me -all resulting in me being 100% satisfied. Their rates are competitive and they are a good group to deal with."}

{"input": "Never a bad meal at Ralph's. I wish they had a larger selection of less expensive wine, but I'm going for the food, not the beverages. The pasta is cooked to perfection and even when it's SWARMING with people, the service is stupendous."}
{"input": "Excellent place for lunch.  Order ahead for takeout or delivery.  The udon noodle salad, hip city ranch and ginger carrot drink are my favorites.  I do NOT recommend the cheesesteak.  I actually threw it out.  I'll stick with Blackbird for that."}

{"input": "Love love LOVE this place!!  We moved to the area from out of state shortly before I got pregnant, so I was really hoping to meet some other local pregnant women.  I've been doing the prenatal yoga classes and they are amazing!  Abby is a fabulous instructor, and all the women who work at the facility are really friendly and helpful.  I felt welcome the second I walked in the door.  I've also been taking their Lamaze birthing class which has been great.  Rachel teaches with a perfect mix of \"natural\" but also giving us a lot of useful medical knowledge.  I've been able to meet a lot of other great pregnant women throughout these experiences and I'm so grateful!"}
{"input": "Tried The Wine Loft last night and had a complete different experience then what most reviewers had. Our service was phenomenal, wine was delicious, and the food we tried was tasty!

{"input": "Employees need to be coached in hygiene and proper food handling techniques. Was a frequent visitor but that one gross employee made me notice other things and question whether I would come back and as of yet I have not. I messaged them previously and didn't receive any replies.\n\nFood is usually decent and over priced but didn't mind until that one nasty guy.\n\nMessage:\n\n\nWe eat here quite regularly but I witnessed something extremely disturbing and unsanitary today that I would really like to consult management about. \n\nAn employee who was both taking cash and serving food proceeded to grab fruits with his bare hands (unwashed) then wipe his hands on the back of his pants. He then went back to taking orders where he used his arm and same hand to wipe his nose, sniffed, and touched his hair. I cannot tell you how disgusted I was as it made me look to other areas of sanitation lapses as well.  \n\nThank you."}
{"input": "My husband and I went to Le Roux's out of curiosity, and it did not disappoint AT ALL. We will definitely be back when we come back to Louisiana!  The crawfish fries were AMAZING, and the fish po boy didn't need any additives! If you're in town, go check this place out!"}
{"input": "Was our best meal in NOLA. Fantastic gumbo and the BBQ shrimp is fantastic ... Different than I expected as it Comes in a bowl with fantastic tasting BBQ sauce which was consistency of soup. The give you bread to soak up the fabulous sauce. In New York when u order BBQ shrimp you get shrimp on a skewer with a thick BBQ sauce lathered on top. Me B version far superior. \n\nGreat meal and great  service."}

{"input": "Upland is a brewery based out of Bloomington, Indiana that has become popular enough to open up a couple additional locations in central Indiana.  All of their beers are very good, and I am also a fan of their burgers and tenderloins.  Therefore, I was excited to try their pizza, but I don't think it ended up being on par with these other items.  My margherita pizza had a cracker-like crust and was pretty light overall.  The cheese was good, but none of the other toppings added much flavor.  There was no red sauce as is typical for a true margherita pizza.  My opinion is that Upland's pizza might serve as a nice appetizer for a group, but I'll be sticking with their burgers or tenderloins as my meal of choice on future visits."}
{"input": "I've been here 3 times so far and each time I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. I've tried the peanut butter infused cold brew and iced americano I liked them both.  My mom had the cortado which she raved about. But the treats they home make here are my favorite part. Like the chocolate chia pudding topped with toasted coconut and raspberries is DELICIOUS :) Also the PB ball with chia seeds, coconut, oats, and chocolate chips goes perfectly with my coffee. This coffee shop is unique and has its own charm I love it!"}
{"input": "We went there for dinner on New Year's Eve.  It was an early dinner @4pm because we walked down Race Street at 6pm to catch the early fireworks show.  We had a mixed generation family dinner and they were very accommodating as two family members were in wheelchairs.  Our waitress Cindy was very warm, friendly and did a great job!  Overall everyone loved their food we had calamari appetizers which were good and stuffed mushrooms which were huge and not what we expected.   Entrees we ordered were grilled shrimp, stuffed lobster tails and fried oysters which my Dad really really liked!!!  We also had crab balls for an app which everyone really enjoyed.  Old decor but classic qualify seafood in a non-fussy environment with a warm and friendly staff."}
{"input": "I have had two very good experiences here. One weeknight they had live music and the musician dedicated songs to my friend and I the whole evening- very cute and charming. My favorite item was the combo fajitas of chicken, steak, and shrimp - huge portions and great taste. Would definitely recommend if you're in the Fats City area."}
{"input": "Service horrible. 3rd visit here hoping this place makes it since it's local, but I doubt it. When are they going to hire some experienced help that are not uninterested teenagers? \nFirst two trips couldn't get bartender to acknowledge us without flagging down, tonight icing on the cake. Do not waste your time. Waitresses walking by, like.we were invisible. Got up, found waitress asked for service.....never came back. Owner made excuses. Sorry to see you go overpriced Craft House."}
{"input": "Who actually enjoys a hospital for anything other than new baby good news?  Although not the case for our recent visits I will say this hospital is very good, accommodating and very patient focused.  Those that I have interacted with try to connect with the patient and are not afraid to smile or use light humor in a non emergent situation.  They have taken excellent care of mom."}
{"input": "The problem with this place is that as prime South Street real estate, the exorbitant cost of rent is inherently passed down to its customers through its overpriced food and drinks.  And I do mean overpriced.\n\nThe food here is nothing special.  Nothing you will eat here will make you think, \"Oh my God.  That was the best ________ I've ever had.\"\n\nYou'll pay $6 for a Yuengling here and you'll hate it, but hopefully you'll be happy enough people-watching on the patio to forget about it."}
{"input": "This little  hut has the best Mexican food in the area. Every time that I go there, I can't pass up the steak tacos. Very good!"}
{"input": "I have been coming here for about a year now and this last week was my 5th visit. I live in the Bay Area. I'm a player card member so they send me free room or discounted room offers all the time. This is a very nice hotel/ casino. Never had a bad experience. Love that I can check in online before getting to to hotel and just use the express kiosk when I get there to get my room keys and avoid the long line,  LOVE THAT! The rooms are always nice and clean and comfortable. The last 2 rooms I have stayed in had views of the pool which was nice! \nThe pool is very nice and relaxing and never too crowded. The spa Toscana is very nice but a bit pricey. None of the restaurants I have tried there so far have been great but I haven't tried to steakhouse or Chi yet, so I haven't had the full experience yet. The slots are never too crowded when I go and can usually get on the machines I like to play with little to no delay. \nI enjoy visiting here. I will keep returning as long as they keep sending me sweet offers!!"}
{"input": "Yes yes yes! What an excellent addition to newtown. We have eaten in twice and gotten take out multiple times. Our favorites are the chicken tikka masala, lamb korma, papdi chaat, and aloo tiki chaat. Everything we have tried so far has been delicious."}
{"input": "With inspired brews and filling Eastern European fare to soak up the alcohol, Crime & Punishment is bringing the \"brewery\" back in \"Brewerytown.\"\n\nI loved Space Dogs - smooth, sour IPA with just the right amount of pineapple. The mushroom pelmeni and potato and caramelized onion pierogies were big winners in my book. I was NOT a fan of the pickle bowl. All the veggies were overly salted and there was an unpleasant raw vinegar taste.\n\nThe picnic benches and friendly service create an inviting, laid back environment that won't tire you out. I will definitely come back on a lazy weekend for beer and dumplings!"}
{"input": "My Room was disgusting. The odor when I walked in was terrible. They had put a very large air filter in the living room to try and mask the smell. The carpet looks as if it was molding in the bedroom against the wall - looks to be the shower wall. Must have leaked.  No iron had to call in am and wait. Oh btw when I called to have someone come up and check the room and the smell they never came - nice!  You know Mgmt knows about the issues and are avoiding them. I'm a Hilton and Marriott frequent guest for business. Man this makes me not want to give Hilton my business. Starwood is now going to move up a notch as  top two property to stay at. \n\nOh the power went out in the hotel at 6 am ish. Not their fault as the waffle house next door had it power off too. It was freaky though to wake up in pitch black. Thank god for iPhone flashlight app!!!"}
{"input": "The cashiers have always been friendly and the coffee is great! I've come here every time I visit st. Pete, and the shops are it are great to check out!"}
{"input": "These guys are great!  Thorough. Professional. Team!!!  Love it. Way better than jiffy lube!"}
{"input": "Met friends there for brunch on a Sunday. Boer fact day to chill on their expansive patio with some refreshing margaritas.  Staff was friendly and professional.  The atmosphere has a nice cool vibe to it.  Definitely a great addition to the Tampa food scene for an upscale Mexican restaurant.   Table side guacamole was well prepared, and came paired up with gluten free tortilla chips.  The added hot sauce was HOT.  I eat a lot of spice but this definitely brings the kick.   Food was generally good. Not outstanding but tasty and fresh. I had the carne Asada  tacos.  Definitely would revisit"}
{"input": "I love Cosi but this Cosi is going down hill fast. I always get a signature salad and lately they are made wrong and no dressing at all. How hard is it to make their own signature salad!? It's practically what they are known for!!! So angry."}
{"input": "Crawfish mac n cheese = outstanding! Cornbread was awesome, too. Good strong drinks and great service."}
{"input": "Great food!  Service was super nice: George!  Crab cakes were awesome.  Just a great place to eat!"}
{"input": "Nice Experience!!  We had quiche and Joe's scramble and a Lemmon muffin, all excellent.  The bottomless mimosas were wonderful and the waitstaff kept them coming.  Such a great start to Saturday.  The remodel was well worth the wait, the place looks fantastic!"}
{"input": "I must say after 20 minutes of aimlessly driving in Delran, we finally stumbled across this hidden gem. My husband and I were greeted with such friendly faces, which set the tone for the night. We told them it was our anniversary and they were more than welcome to accommodate. They gave us a nice secluded table on the beach with lit candles, it was just what we wanted. Our server was very prompt and sweet. She was more than willing to go over the menu and explain the specials in more lament terms. My husband had the Grilled ribeye and I had the Salmon. Everything was grilled to perfection with just the right accompaniments. But the cherry on top the night, of course, was dessert. I was sold as soon as our server brought over the dessert tray. We had the carrot cake and sugar free cheesecake. THE CARROT CAKE WAS UNBELIEVABLY MOIST AND DELICIOUS! The cheesecake was so creamy, you didn't even miss the sugar. I will definitely be making Foyster's Dockside a regular spot for us."}
{"input": "Iced Irish cream coffee was exactly what I needed. Free wifi, chilled place. Outdoor seating. Not freezing cold like other cafes around."}
{"input": "Stopped for a beer the other day - a bit slow and they were out of the beer I wanted but it was all in all not a bad time.  Cheese plate was good, well chosen and well presented if a bit skimpy."}
{"input": "This deli is truly as good as it gets.  From the food, staff, customers, and the blues of course, this atmosphere creates something special in Saint Louis.  I'm there at least once a week and will continue to do so for many years to come.  If you haven't been there before, I guarantee you will be hooked after the first visit."}
{"input": "I just love these guys.  They are quick to respond, do excellent work, and are always courteous and careful.\n\nI have been so pleased with the maintenance they provide, it is one of the few companies I keep a contract with and truly trust.\n\nIf you need an excellent AC service or installer, definitely give REM a try."}
{"input": "My daughter was married at the Presidio Chapel in May, 2015. The wedding was magical and we were all treated really well by Rain Longo(she coordinates special events in the Chapel). She was very patient, supportive and enthusiastic. The chapel itself made for an outstanding and very authentic venue. My daughter and bridesmaids were able to get ready in a beautiful adjoining room. The rental of the Chapel included use for 6 hours and it was very affordable. Thanks to all for making this special day so perfect. Thanks!!!!"}
{"input": "For a long, long time, Dallesandro's was my philly cheesesteak haven.  However, since their change in ownership, they've gone steadily downhill.  Chubby's and Mama's tided me over until I could find suitable replacement.  Thanks to Larry's Steaks, I've rekindled my passion for cheesesteaks.\n\nLarry's Steaks, situated by St. Joe's University, offers the closest thing to the original Dallesandro's cheesesteak I've found.  The meat is sliced and minced into tiny little pieces, maximizing surface area.  Then the cheese is melted throughout so it covers most of the steak and ensures a heavenly consistency and flavor.  The onions and mushrooms are up to snuff as well.  It's greasy enough to slide down your throat but not so much that it's a mess to eat.  I can't attest to the other menu items, but that hardly matters.  If you are up for a real philly cheesesteak, skip pat's and geno's (and the whiz, i can't believe people actually eat that stuff) and pick up a Larry's steak."}
{"input": "I really enjoy the park for both walking and biking (both casual gravel roads and some pretty tough mountain bike trails too).  When I lived in Center City it was a great way to escape and I couldn't believe a park this nice was so close to Philly.\n\nA WORD OF CAUTION: my car was broken into in broad daylight in a seemingly active parking lot off of Lincoln Drive.    I foolishly forgot to hide some bags on my back seat and sure enough I came back to a broken window.   We did find almost evrerything a short distance away minus the valuables.  My advice is lock everything out of sight in your trunk and park on the street if possible.   I usually am smarter but made a mistake.    A few passersby shared with me that this is a pretty common occurrence, but I think it can be easily avoided with a few precautions."}
{"input": "I had the traditional breakfast (two eggs, bacon, toast, and fruit) and split the french toast with friends. It was good. I have to say my favorite part was their English Breakfast Tea made with a french press and fresh honey. Delicious. It's slightly on the pricey side but you are in Santa Barbara in the touristy section."}
{"input": "My god is this place ever wonderful! Such a huge selection delicious teas! The sales people are also very friendly, and it seems they really enjoy their job. They will literally let you smell absolutely every tea. My favourites are Chocolate Rocket, Swampwater, Tropicalia, and Goji Pop. You can buy tins of loose tea, and these will generally last you a long while. They also carry wonderful tea accessories, teacups, teapots, mesh balls, natural sweeteners, infusers, the works. Definitely try DavidsTea, you won't regret it!"}
{"input": "So I definitely much prefer the feel of the tasting room in Kessler but if you want the full Upland menu you have to come here. Everything was good I had the seitan tenderloin which I always have liked and this was no different, and an Ard Ri to drink also delicious as always. \n\nThe bar seating is really tight but there are plenty of tables and a surprising amount of families. Also a general comment, I went with someone who is full on gluten free (celiac) figuring with their amount of veg friendly they would also be GF friendly. But she struggled to find something to eat, and items were not identified on the menu this is not specific to this location but some options may be a good idea for these folks."}
{"input": "Very fresh ingredients with an authentic taste. Priced per taco to mix and match- which I prefer. Would definitely come back for my next taco fix!"}
{"input": "Love this place! Best Kee Mao in town! Get it \"native thai hot\" (if you can handle it). They pretty much have great everything though. I would also recommend the red or green curry. It will literally light your a** on fire. If you are a fan of the \"hot and spicy\" like I am, then get the waitstaff to bring you a small bowl of peppers with fish sauce. If your food is not spicy enough, then adding some of those peppers will change that in a hurry. \n\nThe place looks completely ghetto on the outside but it actually has a pretty decent interior. So I would say it's a nice quiet atmosphere on the inside. A good place to take a date.\n\nAlso, I must say the prices are quite reasonable, and the service is always excellent."}
{"input": "I was in town on a business trip. This is a cool, fun, dive bar bar. No matter how you describe it, I had fun and so did everyone else. We sat at the bar and had no issues with empty glasses or bottles. Great service, drink specials and friendly locals. The place is big and they do serve food, however we did not eat here. Also plenty of pool tables, decent outside patio. Great place to stop by and enjoy some beverages and meet some local folks."}
{"input": "Large menu selection with reasonably good Vietnamese dishes. They serve the only \"real\" bánh mì in town. However, the Vietnamese coffee should be prepared with condensed milk as advertised on the menu but unfortunately it is not. Friendly and relaxed atmosphere. Good service!"}
{"input": "Stopped here today. Been wanting to get in here. It was worth the time. Best sandwich I've had in a very long time. The gal at the counter was friendly and helpful. What a treat. They have fresh sausage and homemade meatballs. Don't pass this place up. Five stars. If there was ten stars I'd give it ten."}
{"input": "Who gets in fights at a recreational hockey game you ask; boys. Most of the teams are made up of men trying to compensate for their shortcomings. Bar is never open. One young ref is the absolute worst & is partial to his buddies. Let the damn game continue in play & be consistent about your calls. If I was paying money to play a sport & had someone like that enforcing my game I'd want to put him out there on the rink."}
{"input": "Cafe Napoli rt 40 . That was our spot great Great great food . Fresh garlic ,fresh basil. Great people. Must try serios pescatore, scallops scampi . You can see chef cooking ."}
{"input": "This restaurant is seriously lacking in customer service!  We have dined many times at Dish.  We like the food.  We made a reservation two weeks ahead for 3 people.  When we arrived we were seated at the smallest table in the restaurant which barely fits two people.  The table next to us had an extra person added at the end, his back was literally a couple of inches from our table.  We asked for a table that would accomdate three people and not involve eating with someone's large back at our very tiny table.  We were rudely informed that it was a take or leave it situation.  It was very frustrating since we booked this as a special night out weeks earlier.  Unfortunately, we are writing this restraurant off our list."}
{"input": "Best pies I've ever had.  We buy a pie for every major family meal so I've tried nearly they're entire selection. The Dutch apple pie and the sugar pie are my favorites.  Always nice to support a small business that makes a superior product."}
{"input": "Stopped in for a friend's birthday on 8-17-2015. Natalie was our server and she was delightful. She greeted put party as soon as we walked on the door with a wonderful smile and a great attitude. She seated us a couple tables right away and went over the menu and specials they offered that day. My wife was undecided about what beer to have so Natalie was great and brought out several tasters for my wife to try, it was a big help.  She made sure that everyone had full drink,  and took a accurate order from us. The food was well prepared and tasted great.  I had the boneless sticky fingers with the original buffalo sauce and they rocked. The steaks fries where awesome,  cooked perfectly,  was very happy with my dish. The service was outstanding,  very professional and attentive to out party. The only thing I would change would the price of food,  seemed a little high. Other than that,  was a fantastic experience. Thank you Natalie for great service,  you are the best."}
{"input": "After driving pass all the seafood restaurants around Clearwater Beach, I knew wanted seafood right there and then. I wasn't familiar with the area and did not do any yelping before hand, so was pretty hesitant to just blindly pick a restaurant.  Finally, after a long day at the beach, we made a quick walk across the street to all the restaurants and thats when we stumbled into Crabby Bill's. We ordered the $25 bucket of steamed seafood. It was decent, not necessarily the best fresh seafood. This was just a quick snack that I shared with one other person to keep us going before our big dinner at Bern's Steak House that we had reservation for a couple hours later."}
{"input": "A bit loud, and hardly a value, but it's a great place to go and have some messed up woman rip your heart to shreds while still enjoying the food."}
{"input": "Tasty food. Slightly marked up with prices but that's to be expected since it is on Stearn's Wharf. LONG WAIT!!"}
{"input": "Good food. Great service Hailey was the shit!\nDon't worry when we make this mac and cheese business pop off we'll give u the word."}
{"input": "Really nice staff but mediocre Italian food served luke warm.   We went here for a large group dinner around Christmas mostly because it was a BYOB and there was no fixed menu for a group of 10.   We ordered numerous appetizers including, fried gnocchi, calamari, garlic pizza bread, fried zucchini.   It was all just ok.   The main courses were unadventurous Italian American selections.  The sauces were just meh.   Three of us ordered 3 different chicken dishes and they all came out with the same sauce.   Boring.  Although the staff was very accommodating, the food was too lack luster to return."}
{"input": "I love these guys. You couldn't ask for better customer service. My shoes needed more stretching after the first round, and they explained the process to me, stretched them again to perfection, and gave me some shoe spray for free! If you want expert service from helpful, welcoming people, this is the place."}
{"input": "We placed a large dinner order for take-out via Fellini's web site. When we arrived, there was no record of the order. They agreed to cook it while we waited, but when we got home with the food, half of the dinners were not correct.\n\nThe next day, I called and asked to speak with the owner/manager who got on the phone. He profusely apologized and explained the reason for the ordering snafu. He offered to re-do the order as a comp. A few days later, we ordered take-out again and he made good on his word. The dinners were ready on time and were delicious. \n\nAny business can experience a snafu, so it was very nice of them to own it and rectify the problem. We will definitely be back!"}
{"input": "Iron Hill is always a good choice... Scratch kitchen everything is made in house breads sauces and most importantly BEER!!!! each location has a micro brew set up this place is a true beer lovers heaven it is not just a Brewery in name like some places try and pass off... The meat loaf is always a good choice and it is not something I typically eat out... also the chicken pot pie is very good... it is a little pricey I think it should be about two and a half dollar signs on here but you are paying for quality.... my favorite part is getting ordering all the new beers in the sample sizes and all the waiters are very knowledgeable on the beers.... Big Dan in the kitchen is always serving up great food!!!!"}
{"input": "Ricardo's is a great Italian restaurant in Lafayette Square.  For the quality of the food, the prices are extremely reasonable.  I'm not sure they offer any \"ground breaking\" Italian dishes but everything is very good.  I especially like their tortellini and house salads.  Portions are good.  Service is good.  It is a family owned place in a great location.  If you're looking for good Italian food that is reasonably priced, in a casual yet vibrant atmosphere in the city, I would definitely go to Ricardo's."}
{"input": "easy parking in a small corner strip mall...finding inside clean and tidy...early dinner hours and finding tables plenty...as minutes pass, customers steadily filing in...menu mixed with vietnamese and some standard american-chinese dishes...finding a bun bo hue on the menu and taking...few minutes and a big bowl delivered with the right side of vegetables...taking a sip of the broth and finding the soup very good...squeeze of lime and adding the vegetables to the hot broth...perfect balance of sour, spicy, salty and sweet flavors with the distinct lemon grass aroma...plenty of fish cakes...tender pig knuckles....soft cubes of pig blood...a very good bun bo hue in reno for $9.70 after tax..."}
{"input": "Just down right darn good pizza with lots of different varieties you don't see much anywhere else! And hello beers!"}
{"input": "Again for those that see my review I only give 5 stars after multiple trips.   This local pho shop has an eclectic regular clientele that is loyal for a reason.   Great food and very nice staff. \n\nThe ingredients are so fresh.   I had bun beef because I was not phongry. That is pho hungry.   \n\nHighly recommend stopping in."}
{"input": "YUM YUM that's for sure, great place for an awesome sub. Potato salad along with the macaroni salad is also very good. I can't believe I've never been to or heard of it before. Staff is awesome, great place that we keep going back to now."}
{"input": "Old Glory - you make a perfect, not too lime-y, Gimlet. For this reason alone, I will always be a fan."}
{"input": "The Penang chicken with the chicken flavor infused white rice will always be one of my favorite meals. Wether in Boston or in Philly, the quality is the same and I am a huge fan. When we came in the line was very long but surprisingly we were sat in about 15-20 minutes. The service was fast from start to finish so I didn't have to wait long before I could start eating the juicy amazing chicken. I was planning on getting an order to go to drive back to Virginia to eat but that seemed greedy so I didn't. I regretted that decision the second I got back home so next time, I will be greedy!"}
{"input": "Amazing food. If money were no object, would eat here every night. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The seafood stew is unique and delicious!"}
{"input": "Excellent breakfast! We asked for several changes - eggs medium, bacon and hash browns extra crispy, biscuits instead of toast, pecan pancakes instead of plain- and everything came out just as we wanted. The pecan pancakes were flavorful, sweet, fluffy, and packed with pecans! Our waiter was friendly and gave us great service with a smile! Try this out when you are in the French Quarter!"}
{"input": "Awesome little \"mom & pop\" cafe!!! Warm atmosphere, cheerful staff, they had someone playing the piano too!! Looked like a lot of locals here... most were welcomed with a hug, as we were given one when we left!!!\nFood was fabulous!! I had the chicken salad (which was recommended) and it did not disappoint!! Prices were very reasonable.\nIf we came back into town... I would definitely stop back here!!! A+++"}
{"input": "AVOID AT ALL COSTS\nBy far the worst pizza I've had. Thin crust was not crunchy, olives were junk and salad was $6 for bad strands of lettuce and minimal cheese which looked horribly powdered. It came in a prepacked divider. Rip off. Not worth more than a dollar. \n\nTheir knots were ok, and extremely unhealthy, but rest was crap.\n\nI normally don't order from them or anyone else but good pizza like Grimaldi's, BJs or Mellow Mushroom but I hadn't gone grocery shopping and normally stock up on organic pizza from Publix or whole foods which btw is cheaper and tastier. But, this was the only place opened late. \n\nI never want dominoes again. It's just a reminder that corporate chains need to fall and get out the way. I rather pay for quality. Not preservatives and poison. \n\nNever Again!!! \n\nCalling card tomorrow to get refund! Waste of $30."}
{"input": "Good cuts at 19 Blue Salon! I was looking for a last minute hair cut and Peter squeezed my appointment in and hooked me up. He was very meticulous, skilled at his craft and friendly. He suggested easy to use at home products for maintenance and then recommended some great eats in SB. Loved the early 90's jams that played while I was there too! Seriously, go check out Peter!"}
{"input": "I went in here the other day for a rehearsal dinner and it was the worst service. 2 waiters had our table but we still had empty cups the whole time had to ask for breadsticks about 4 times, nothing we had was got it was all room temp, and he messed the bill up in the end."}
{"input": "Saw this on our way to Art Museum and sculpture garden.  Looked interesting so we stopped to check it out and it was large and impressive. Lots of history and it's a great cemetery.  I wasn't aware Nola has so many nice cemeteries. There are like 6 on this road and I really enjoyed exploring here for hours."}
{"input": "After trying twice unsuccessfully to get there early enough to get a meal within 20 minutes, I finally was able to break away from work and was 5th in line. I had heard of the \"food truck nazi\" and that it was the best in town and found Gus, the falafel nazi, as he called himself, lived up to his reputation and more. \nAs my turn came up, I approached the cart tenuously, for I did not want to blow it by asking too many questions. He immediately recognized me as a new customer and told me all about the fresh ingredients he uses.\nChicken is cooked over coal and was tender on the inside and perfectly cooked on the outside. Falafel was delicious, as were the grapes and his homemade pasta that went along with it.\nThere was enough food for 2 people.\nWell worth the wait!"}
{"input": "This always happens to me.  My expectations get raised so high by the reviews on Yelp that I make the wrong decision when ordering.  Ideally I would have had a sweet and a savory, but my daughter wanted a sweet too and I had to have the Bananas Foster French Toast.  It was OK, and I'm glad that I tried it because it will inform my home-made brunch menus in the future.  But it was a crying shame that I didn't have the grits."}
{"input": "Greenwood is not as ritzy as Metairie Cemetery but worth a visit (yes, I have ancestors here, too). It is convenient that it is right near the end of the Canal Streetcar line and they have the Holy Grounds coffee place nearby and Holt and a couple of other cemeteries are there as well. \n\nWhat I really like about Greenwood is that they have an excellent website. If you do or think you do have ancestors buried there, go to www.greenwoodnola.com. I wish every cemetery had such a great website. It even has pictures. If it weren't for the website, I wouldn't have known that my grandmother's  older sister that died as a young child was in the tomb of her grandparents rather than her parents, since her name is not on the tombstone. I had never even thought to wonder why her name wasn't on the Mayne tomb, anyway, because she died so very long ago. Maybe I need to find which Flanagan cousin is responsible for that tomb and see if we can get  her name and dates inscribed."}
{"input": "Food was ok. Seemed to lack flavor. Potato salad was blah. They forgot to use our free Appetizer Yelp coupon. But since husbAnd checked us out I shouldn't complain. But it was a slow Sunday so not sure why.  Lots of other options on the river front to try.  So in general not great but not horrible."}
{"input": "Such an outstanding show!! We are here from Las Vegas visiting family in Tucson.  Living in Las Vegas, I see several shows a year, however they don't all have the charm and family feel that the Gaslight Theatre has. The actors and band are all a joy to watch perform. The jokes are funny and sweet and it's a great time to be had at any age. I definitely recommend this to any and all who enjoy a fun time for any occasion or for even no occasion at all."}
{"input": "Now this location has a good twist to an old college pub.  Great place to watch a game.  Not a bad seat around.  Appears to be great for families too.  \n\nHoping the wine list improves."}
{"input": "4 stars for carved turkey and smoked sausage, 5 for genuine staff and Diet Mountain Dew!!"}
{"input": "I went here on a date with my girl friend and we decided to eat outside.  It was beautiful  but cold so I wish they had put the heaters on.  Other than that it was very good.  My salad was perfect and I would definitely get the chicken parmigiana again.  My girlfriend had some sort of seafood medley pasta on special which was excellent.  I forget what the dessert was called but it was like a creme puff filled with vanilla ice cream and covered with cocolate. I would reccomend that.  I will go back."}
{"input": "Took my flat spare by here. They QUICKLY attended to me, checked the tire visually, rolled it to the back to inflate it to search for the leak then explained it couldn't be fixed. There was no pressure to buy a replacement form them. No charge for their time/effort. That impressed me."}
{"input": "Great cheap eats.\n\nThe pho tai here is very good with a dense and textured broth. There isn't a wide selection of Vietnamese restaurants in Nashville, and Kien Giang manages to have the best pho for the area. \n\nThe restaurant itself is a bit dive-y and the staff isn't overly friendly. Nothing of-putting by any means . . .  but be prepared, it feels more like going to a diner than fine dining. \n\nWhat sets Kien Giang apart is their pho take-out! They just kill it. Packing up boiling hot soup and all the accouterments takes a certain amount of smarts, and they really get the job done. \n\nLike others have mentioned: cash only."}
{"input": "Stopped here while visiting family. So glad we did as we all enjoyed our meals so much. Service was impeccable and a great value. We had the chicken little pasta, chicken wrap, quiche, and I had the monte cristo which was the best I ever had! I can't wait to go back to Tampa just to eat here!"}
{"input": "Super cute place! Employees are very nice! Cookie dough is delicious! This is a must & we are glad we found it (lost while in town)."}
{"input": "Is it okay to say this is my favorite brunch spot even though all I've ever had here is their grits? I would definitely try one of their other courses and I'm pretty sure they're amazing, but it is so hard to not get my favorite thing off their menu! Their portion is so huge, i usually share it with another person (if I'm not being greedy)! You can literally top anything onto your dish and they vary from .50 cents to 1.00 dollar.  I love to add on avocados, red bell peppers, bacon, cheddar, and mushrooms! Their grits are incredible, it is not grainy nor watery. It's just perfect. I can go on and on. but I'm pretty sure you get the point! \n\nEventually, i will try their other dishes, but for now, it's all about their grits."}
{"input": "Love this store especially with the nice selections they have. However, my review is for the shoe section. I went in to try on different flats and i'm normally a 7-7.5 in women's but i have wide feet so i had to keep asking the sales associate for different sizes and she was really rude and gave me attitude. I was not pleased with her attitude and ended up walking out of the store. Maybe she was having a bad day or maybe that's her personality but i sure did not feel welcomed by her."}
{"input": "Fresh spring water... check!\nHugely portioned (although on the menu it said regular sized) cobb salad... check!\nCheap prices... check!\n\nDuring my short stay at Reno, one of my friends checked this place out, came back to the hotel, and urged all of us to come eat here. The food was great. \n\nIf I ever end up back in Reno, I will definitely come back here. I really want to try their \"nookie\" for breakfast."}
{"input": "The food is pretty good and the service is very nice. However the entrees are very expensive.  $16.99 plus tax for an entree (chicken and rice with garlic bread) .   Its good just not worth it for me. I haven't tried the buffet so I may come back to try the buffet but not the entree."}
{"input": "The staff is very welcoming and the building is pleasant to be in.  The doctors are both highly professional and we have had 2 dogs with them almost for 3 years with great results."}
{"input": "I came in to get my VW beetle windshield replaced and was quoted $139, which is weird because a week ago I was quoted $150 @ the Oracle location, it just seems like everything in South Tucson is priced just right!  \n   I arrived at Tony's @ 8:35am, 5 minutes after they open and already there was a customer in the waiting room :/  I was told it was going to take 1.5-2 hrs.  Not to bad i think,  besides there is a Mexican restaurant next door (Jalisco).  \n    The waiting room at Tony's is a bit small,  with 5 chairs,  a tv, and all of their candy machines are empty,  what the heck,  what if I was having a crazy sweet tooth today?  Anyways,  they took about 2 hrs which was what they quoted and my windshield looks awesome!"}
{"input": "Livery is awesome - exactly what Indy needed!!! Thank you, Cunningham Restaurant Group!!!"}
{"input": "Second visit even better than the first!!  Loved the butternut squash and goat cheese Rangoons, and the delightfully filling mushroom yakisoba. Amazing flavor, and a smoky , meaty feel though it is meatless. Then came the coconut curry ramen. Heaven in a bowl. \nMy only complaint is when you have to wait for seating there is no way to hang by the bar without constantly feeling you are in The servers' way as they breeze by with deliciousness in bowls and plates. So worth the wait before heading to the theater. Plus, food comes out very quickly so we made the curtain, just barely, but with really happy tummies."}
{"input": "Delicious and the pumpkin risotto is fabulous\nEvery time we go there something new to try even though I'm not a fan of vegetables and I'm not vegetarian they always manage to make things taste delicious"}
{"input": "Unfortunately like every other store in this franchise this one is no different, lack luster customer service and an over priced and over packed store :/ They give you hardly anything for your items but I guess it beats trying to sell them yourself? I wish there was better competition out there but I guess this is what we've got in the area..."}
{"input": "Ignorant bartender. Took forever for him to wait on you at a table on a Sunday afternoon, not even during football season.  Lesson learned. Never have a bartender wait on you for food.  Number 1, they don't want to do it, but also, they don't know the menu or anything about the kitchen when you ask a question. This is a typical suburban blue collar and millennial underwhelming establishment to watch Sports in with a pint of flat Budweiser. It is perfect for blue collars who swear that walk in dressed like they just finished a 10 hr day either painting, fixing drains, or laying down planks, or up on a roof. After 10 or 11pm the DB millennials roll in, espec on weekends."}
{"input": "Based this visit entirely upon previous Yelp reviews, which as usual we're spot on. Great atmosphere and feel to this place - Kind of an art house meets coffee house meets Animal House environment. Very unusual. In a good way. The service was relaxed, social and great. The beverages were delicious and the menu was quite interesting. \nI so wanted the food to be much better than it was. Tried the Bird and Pig, a specialty grilled cheese and a couple apps. Everything was good but not great. In truth, if I was judging on food alone, there would be three stars instead of four. But the atmosphere and the staff clearly deserved the extra star, and I'll head back to try some other items on the menu next visit."}
{"input": "Here, it seems, the store is in chaos regularly.  Most of the product was recently relocated in different areas of the warehouse.  Some of the food items have been moved and integrated with the rest of the merchandise.  Typical 'advertising' to herd shoppers closer to impulse items.  Why would one look for a 4 pound bag of M&M's next to a patio set?\nCan't complain too much.  Red Lobster biscuit mix and olive oil are generally cheaper here than anywhere else."}
{"input": "Bought my beautiful new bike from this shop a few weeks ago then promptly crashed it (curse you, trolley tracks!). I brought it back to the shop this afternoon to see if there was any way they could try to fix the front basket, which was pretty mangled, and to give the bike a once-over to make sure it was safe to ride. I was expecting to have to leave the bike with them for a few days, but the whole process took less than a half hour. Not only did they fix the basket (not perfect, but pretty damn close), but they also fixed the gear shifter that was a little out of whack... FOR FREE.  I couldn't believe it. \n\nI also want to note that everyone in the shop- from the owners, to the sales people on the floor, to the mechanics, to the dog that greets you at the door- is so friendly and welcoming. I am so happy I found them."}
{"input": "You honestly can't go wrong here. My favorites are the Udon Noodle Salad (a-ma-zing) and the Crispy Hipcity Ranch (so, so good). Friendly staff, fast service. Oh, they deliver too!"}
{"input": "Was in town for a meeting, and have always wanted to try Luke's, and only a 3 min walk from the Marriott Courtyard. I had Oysters, Salad, and Chicken for my main dish. Absolutely the best I've ever had! Great service, friendly staff, didn't have a reservation, but only took 5mins to seat me in a packed house, on a Thursday night."}
{"input": "Spent 30 dollars on the Asian Bouillabaisse and then later spent 3 hours throwing it up back. \nService was good but the salmon and prawn were overcooked and there were A LOT of baby carrots."}
{"input": "OMG wonderful experience friendly staff...I was very impressed when I was able to choose my own massage oils for my massage...the staff was friendly and understanding...\n\nIt was a great experience and I will be back for a package deal.."}
{"input": "Awesome breakfast.  Great location near Lafayatte Park.  I ate breakfast here every morning of my recent business trip.  Had delicious Oatmeal one day then, after deciding it was pointless to eat healthy in New Orleans, had fantastic omelettes for the rest of my stay.  I love places that give you your last cup of coffee to go and Cafe at The Square does.  Thanks!"}
{"input": "Don't let the generic food-court-style name fool you; there is nothing generic about this Korean outpost of awesomeness in the culinary wasteland of Brentwood. I love the sensation that I'm underpaying for my food, and the chef here whips up Korean dishes of a character and quality that is likely matchless in Tennessee, and they turn around and sell 'em for $10 or less. The Korean tacos are all diabolically good, the fried rice side dish is good enough to be an entree, and the daily specials surely hold the key to paradise. \n\nIf the great food isn't enough, and it usually is for me, STB has a great community vibe. Many of the customers appear to be on a first-name basis with the folks working here (sadly, my impatience with traffic on Franklin Road means I do not come here often enough to count myself among them), and I am always addressed heartily upon arrival and departure. \n\nWithout question, this one of Greater Nashville's elite cheap food stops."}
{"input": "I love the bartenders! So sweet and so charming ! Brielle by far is the best, so sociable and very charismatic! i always try to grab a beer when she is around !"}
{"input": "Clean food that tastes delicious. I had their turkey chili and Jim's favorite sandwich and both were easy to digest! I devoured every bite."}
{"input": "I'm not sure why I haven't written a review for Pi before now because we have been there a few times.  This time we took my sister-n-law and her boyfriend who had been visiting us from England.  I shared a deep dish and my wife and her sister shared a thin crust.  All of us really enjoyed the pizzas of our choosing.  That is a great thing about Pi.  You can pick whatever style you want and also pick any pizza on their menu for your half. It makes sharing so easy!  \nWe were able to enjoy our pizzas outside on the sidewalk which made it even better.  The only problem was our waiter.  Not that he was a bad waiter, he just seemed to be trying to hard to be some type of character.  He also kept telling us how busy he was when he clearly was not.  \nTo me, Pi is St Louis' hometown pizza place.  (Not an Imo's fan! Provel???)"}
{"input": "Delightful tea shop in south philly.  Though I'm usually one for a beer and a cheesesteak, I found myself in here on a lazy Saturday afternoon, and was pleasantly surprised.\n\nThere's more tea than I can shake a stick at, but I stuck to what I'd call an experimental smoothie.  The young couple that own the place told me they'd fix me up something sweet and caffinated in a smoothie form, so I went with it and it was delicious (Matcha-Banana flavored).\n\nWill return."}
{"input": "8 pm Sunday eve....first the service....judge would object to the service his red head server offered to my wife and I this eve. Very poor and barely no communication the entire service. Had to go to bar area and get my catsup, could not get attention of server....still left a good tip against my better judgement. Now the food, GREAT! Would go back for food and request different server."}
{"input": "Ordered the full slab for $26 expecting the meal to feed at least four people. \nAlthough the meat was plentiful, it comes dry with a small container of BBQ sauce. \nYou run out of sauce about a quarter of the way through even if you are being stingy with it. Also comes with beans and toast but only enough for one person. \nWon't be coming back. \nWe have way better BBQ here in Tucson and much closer too."}
{"input": "Really nice atmosphere and ambiance. My wife and I went for Valentine's Day. Se ordered from their pre fix menu and I got the chicken. The entrees were excellent! We weren't too impressed with the cocktails but then ordered sangrias which were good."}
{"input": "For a long time as a Chinese foodie my family loved going to Han Dynasty. \nBut we went there for my birthday last week and the food was horrible. The string beans were fried in stale tasting oil and the boss won't admit it had a bad taste to it. The walnut sprimp that we ordered were fried in extra thick batter. the small sprimp turned into a fat corn dog looking thing. Our last dish, orange beef was also covered in thick breading, beef was not tender, hard to chew and it had crazy amount of glaze glob on it. Horrible Horrible...I was super disappointed after wanting to visit there for a while. Dont waste your money. This is not how Chinese food should taste like!"}
{"input": "Simply stated...They are true to their word as it relates to having discounted furniture that is less expensive than your name brand furniture stores. The staff was friendly, they definitely don't follow you around the store, however, they get a ding for customer service because they don't seem to be as knowledgeable about the furniture products.\n\nFurniture quality is a mix ranging from low to moderate quality.  \n\nAt the end of the day, if you are looking for less expensive furniture or to get a good deal or to find a unique accent pieces this is the place to be!  I mean...I saw \"the same\" sectional for $1,000 less than the name brand store.   Now that's a deal!!!"}
{"input": "My husband and I were in the neighborhood and gave this place a try this past Friday! It's only $8.99 for the buffet, which is less expensive than all of the other Indian buffets I've been to in the city. But don't think that a lower price tag means bad quality! I was very pleased with everything that I tried and there were plenty of different choices! I felt like the quality of the food and the amount of options were comparable to the other more expensive buffets I've tried in the city. Why pay more??"}
{"input": "I had the French Club Sandwich which came with quinoa salad.  Very good, fresh and light.  The sandwich was filling but not heavy.\n\nIt reminded me of a European cafe.  Real cutlery and glasses (no plastic!) and ceramic plates.  Lovely.  The water I ordered came in a glass bottle with a rubber and ceramic stopper.  Definitely not fast food but the food did come quickly.  I went at noon.\n\nIt's a bit more expensive than I usually do for lunch, but worth it."}
{"input": "Small quiet little place but didn't feel cramped. Excellent bartender."}
{"input": "Once again you arent coming here for anything but the food. It is a place most people will look at and drive by.\n\nHowever it is another hidden gem of epic proportions. They have a different way of making their food with a slight charred taste that is noticeable if you are any sort of regular at eating asian food.\n\nI recommend the shanghai noodles, the flat noodle and beef with black bean, shredded pork crunchy noodle, and a dumpling soup similar to a wonton soup. \n\nThis is another place that you will not regret if you try it. They really shine at the fried noodle dishes, so try keep it close to that if possible. Also try milk tea if you never have before."}
{"input": "This place has incredible tacos! I'd love to try the rest of the menu, but the tacos are so good that I can't bring myself to ordering anything else. The staff is very polite and there's plenty of room for a bigger group of people. I will definitely be back, especially since they have late hours."}
{"input": "Came here during the evening. The food was mediocre at best...very over cooked  meat...they ran out of every side food basically, and the service was god awful! We had to walk over and ask for service. Our waiter kept messing up our order and it took very long for everything (drinks and food) to come out. The waiter even messed up our payment! \nI don't know how this place has as many stars! Bribery!"}
{"input": "Went there today for dinner with family.  Service was ok, drinks were pretty weak. Everyone's food quality and taste was fine, BBQ ribs were barely above room temperature."}
{"input": "Nice, chill afternoon grabbing a few beers. This place isn't fancy, but the bartender had a great playlist and was appropriately chatty. Killed a couple of hours with my dad before my flight out of town. Loved the dive bar bathroom too.....don't change that."}
{"input": "Service was great but food was under seasoned and bland.  This was our second time and the food did not deliver unfortunately."}
{"input": "Amazing friendly service, approachable atmosphere, and food is so delicious! Try the sweet potatoes and the gnocchi with blue cheese - seriously can't beat this place. Almost don't want to share because it is that good...!"}
{"input": "Food is average, but the place is too cramped. The owners are also just not friendly. I was made to wait outside in the cold because somebody in my party arrived late despite having a reservation and nobody else in line."}
{"input": "I got the 60 minute Swedish massage and let me tell you it was amazing! No wait when I arrived. Pleasant atmosphere and wonderful staff. Seriously THE BEST massage I have ever received! I plan to revisit frequently!"}
{"input": "I am still giving it 3 stars despite my most recent experience. In general, I love this place. I like to bring people from out of town because they get good food and get to try beer they wouldn't otherwise. Parking is tricky though.\n\nDon't come on a Sunday night though. I think it's just because no one was around, but the cheese in the cheeseburger was frozen solid. Not pleasant. Otherwise, the beer was good and so was the food.\n\nPros: good beer, good food, interesting place to see\nCons: Parking can be annoying, Sunday night service/food is the opposite of busier times."}
{"input": "I LOVE this place! If you are looking for a quick adjustment without all of the unnecessary chatter about supplements and yoga then this is the place. I was in and out in ten minutes and I felt amazing. I had all of my questions answered and felt well taken care of plus it is super affordable."}
{"input": "Place is going downhill. They raised the prices but not on the menu.   Served cheese whiz instead of Swiss.  Had to get out money back. Staff was rude when questioned.  Just about threw our money back at us."}
{"input": "Let me begin by saying this is the first gym I've ever belonged to. But it's the first for a reason. Nice location, pretty large, new machines, friendly staff, nice mix of people. I'm very comfortable here and very satisfied."}
{"input": "Got a gift certificate to this place over 6 months ago and just last month FINALLY had the GREAT  pleasure of going!! Perfect  spot for lunch. I'm in love with the mixed salad salad sandwich!! One sandwich that I will actually crave:-) yummy homemade ice cream that you won't be able to get enough of!  We will be back."}
{"input": "NICE!! That Say's it! Finest Greek Food and Service. All around you is a Family Atmosphere, Greek Style! You can make a Meal on the Appetizers alone. \nMy suggestions are as follows: \n1) Kria Piklilla ( Cold Sampler Platter ) $15.95 can feed a family of at least 6! \n2) Grilled Vegetable Sampler $8.95 \nEach of these will fill you up. That's a family of 6 I'm talking about! \nMy Friend Nicki Suggested I try Saghanaki (Greek Cheese pan fried then Flambeed with a shot of Ouzo) She was right! Awesome. \nMy Son ordered the Vegetarian Gyro- He LOVED it!!\nI topped it all off with A traditional Greek pound cake soaked with Orange Liquor! Delicious \nProbably the best part of this restaurant, is the fact my Son (Strict Vegetarian),  and I (meat / fish eater),  can both enjoy dozens of Choices from both menu's. That's RARE in a restaurant. It's Usually Meat/Fish oriented, with one or two Non Meat Choices. \n\nGreat Time, Great Service. I suggest Reservations"}
{"input": "I was staying in Columbia for a week, and ordered takeout from this restaurant 4 times!  The pad thai was great every time, and the portions were large enough that I could save some for later.  I wasn't a particular fan of the fried rice's consistency, however.  Also, as one other reviewer mentioned, the pad thai did not come with a lime as it would in many places.  Overall, this place is great, and I will definitely go back next time I am in town!"}
{"input": "Everyone told me they had best cheesesteaks. I was skeptical but ordered pn with a salad. It was  delicous the bread was amazibg abd it wasnt soaked in grease. Salad was fresh and made perfect side. Defiantly recommend you try the cheesteak!"}
{"input": "No less than five people, from the busboy to the owner behind the counter, wished us a friendly 'goodnight' on our way out. That NEVER happens! \nGreat Italian classic meals at good prices. \nNot fancy. (There is a small TV in the dining room) but caters to families with children, small parties and everything in between. Not a quiet, romantic meal, but a tasty one."}
{"input": "My mother, aunt and myself went on this walking tour of Ybor with stops for good food.  What a nice time!  Our guide,  Raymond was very knowledgeable and friendly.  \nIt was about 3 hrs long,  we passed that 3 hr mark because we were sidetracked a few times and chit chatted quite a bit, lol. \nWe learned great details and background about the early days of tampa, the culture, people and ybor in general,  very informative! Along the way we stopped for food tastings . Everything was great,  especially the stone soup company Cuban sandwich!  I would recommend everyone to go on this tour,  visiting or lived here for years this is a fun adventure.  And for the step counters we chalked up over 5000 steps ! It will help offset all the wonderful calories you take in on the tour haha"}
{"input": "I have been told by numerous native philadelphians that Ralph's is one of the best Italian restaurants in the city and is a must to experience. We did not think so. We started off with a grilled calamari appetizer that was soaked in salty red sauce. The amount of sauce overwhelmed the palate to the point where we couldn't even taste the calamari. I got the pasta bolognese with filet mignon tips. Again, the red sauce was very salty. The filet mignon tips was really just average quality beef. My wife ordered the black lobster ravioli which were decent but overly salty. We expected much more from the oldest Italian restaurant in the country."}
{"input": "I don't live in the area, but I found this place while working. It is absolutely incredible! The atmosphere is very relaxing and the worker I had, Ms Z, was pretty new but her hands were like magic! I felt totally refreshed after my session. I would go there every week if I did not live so far away. Everyone should be so lucky to find this place!"}
{"input": "My husband and I stayed in Germantown section of Nashville and ate breakfast both days during our stay....the staff, the food, the attention to detail was TOP NOTCH!!!! We sat At the little bar they have and enjoyed watching the hustle bustle of the staff who showed true southern hospitality to each other and the patrons!!! \nI highly recommend the butter pecan pancakes!! NO frozen home fries here!! Amazing smooth French roast coffee....\nLoved this place!!"}
{"input": "Although we didn't purchase our mattress here, the people here were very nice! At the time, \nwe still lived in California, so when we arrived hoping to purchase the item, the establishment\nwas closed! Oh well, it's still a nice business,...when they're open!"}
{"input": "I love pampering my bum at Infinity Health and Wellness!!\n\nI am so impressed with this place. The ambiance, service and pricing are more than perfect. It's been less than a week and I'm already coming back for my second colonic. \n\nWhat better way can you invest in your body?  \n\nPlease do yourself a favor and get your colonics done here. The PRICING is affordable and if your budget is tight, SAVE $2 a day for less than a month and you're set. Add a clean holistic diet and you are on your way to good health. \n\nYour body will thank you later. \n\nI'm very grateful to have stumbled upon this temple of goodness."}
{"input": "Hands down favorite sub place around. The atmosphere is fun with the fire fighter theme- they totally roll with It from the table decor to the names of the subs. Who doesn't love a hot sub!? They are by far more unique than subway or jimmy johns or any other sub place. They don't have many bread options but the toppings and wide selection of hot sauces makes up for that- talk about flavor! I love the sub machine with the over 120 drink options but with only one machine it takes forever to get your drink.... But at least you can make it special! Every time I go here it's packed! The customer service is great, I love that they walk your meal to you, it's better than standing around or having a pager. They also do boxed lunches or catering which is always a great addition to any party."}
{"input": "Five Guys is my go to greasy cheat food in Indianapolis. \n\nAlways so good.\n\nGet the Cajun fries, but if you're watching calories you'll end up tossing half of them: the \"small\" is still a decent sack full. \n\nEveryone at this location has been friendly, efficient, and accurate: half a dozen orders and never an incorrect one.\n\nCheck out the new mobile app for order-ahead. They finish preparation when you arrive, so so far food has still been fresh and hot (though you will have to wait a few minutes as a result)."}
{"input": "I have always enjoyed my pizzas here. My current favorite is the Yale's Thai. I get it w/out chicken and with sesame seeds because I do not like peanuts on my food. I love every bite. Another favorite has been the Lil' Stevie. My husband likes the Teriyake Chicken, BBQ Chicken and the Yale's Thai pizzas. I would suggest going for the more creative pizzas, I have tried the more simple pizza options and not been wowed. That is just me though as I am thrilled by creatively flavorful foods. The service has been consistent when I have dined here. I purposefully opt for visiting during non-peak hours so it is not too busy. My only wish is that they would offer a gluten free crust and vegan cheese. I would probably always get my pizza here if this was the case."}
{"input": "In my book you can never go wrong having a good old-fashioned meal a Johnny Rockets. I had their recent promo which was a barbecued pulled pork burger. It was a lot of food and a lot of flavor!! Top that with endless fries and I'm a happy camper. Have never had a bad experience at this location. They were recently moved from the casino floor level to the shopping level and since they did that they don't do the singing or dancing anymore which is a shame"}
{"input": "Had the Eggplant Parm as an appetizer for the table and it was as good as it was five years ago. Shrimp Risotto was perfect and my Chicken Malenesa was e cellent. Am also addicted to the crispy herbed flatbread ? That comes in the bread basket."}
{"input": "I decided to try Wicke Auto recently for state safety and emission inspections.  It was convenient for where I work and they were able to get me in.  I wasn't disappointed.  It's a nice big shop and a friendly man named Gary will work with you.  The safety inspection yielded a need for a very small repair and they were able to order the part and have it repaired by the end of the day.  I dropped it off at 8:45am and picked it up by 4pm.  Gary was kind, patient, and knowledgeable.  Charges weren't the cheapest or the most expensive.  Solid experience and I'll go back for a quote should I need service in the future."}
{"input": "I have been a fan of Chateau La Vin for a few years. It has been fun to watch the place evolve. At first it was more of a wine store with only a few tables. Now it has been transformed into a wine bar. He offers cheese and crackers and people order from the local restaurants and some of them even deliver. He had two guys playing music. He offers so many different wines and is willing to share his knowledge. My friend is a beer drinker and he has a nice variety for them as well. He does have a few tables out in front. This is a great place....."}
{"input": "Great dessert place after eating a great meal downtown.  The selections vary but you can get any gelato that your heart and tastebuds desire.  I got the bitter almond and sweet Amish milk,  it was great combo and rich milky gelato.  \n\nSkip the mediocre dessert at the restaurants and get some top class frozen gelato."}
{"input": "I am a Hoosier native but lived in Portland for 6 years and as soon as I stepped foot in Libertine I was like oooooooo Portland.  It was love at first sight.  \n\nOur group stood at one of the communal \"waiting tables\".  It would have been nice to sit but we only stayed for a drink apiece, so it wasn't that bad.  Our waiter was good but there was an issue with their computer/credit card machine, so there was a delay in getting our check taken care of. \n\nI had the screw & bolt which was nice.  I tried my friend's sharpshooter, which was amazing and on a return trip this is what I will order.  \n\nIf I lived in Indy this would be my spot; I am happy I am in Bloomington because I might be here way too often.  I look forward to trying more cocktails and the food."}
{"input": "Favorite smoke shop can trust there juice and full honest opinion at this location love Javi juice maker went above and beyond to help my husband and i!!!! Only PLACE to go!!!!"}
{"input": "If I could give it a zero, I would. I order a plain hamburger, and realized they put  bacon in it (which I am allergic to and unable to eat) after two bites. When I went back to the drive-through window to complain (didn't realize the actual restaurant was open--it was almost 2 after all...), the guy took back the burger, said nothing, and disappeared. After 2 minutes of awkwardly making conversation with the next people in line in their car, he came back and rudely told me I had to go inside to get my food. Which I did. And still did not get an apology.\n\nI refuse to go back there after that ordeal, which is a shame, because it's nice to have a variety of places to go to after DT. Guess Freebirds it is!"}
{"input": "As far as I know, this is the best video rental store in existence.  The staff is knowledgeable and friendly, but the selection really sets it apart.  Suppose you want to rent the newest release and a VHS of the best hockey fights of the 1970s...They would probably have both available at a very low cost.  I only wish that there was a place like Casa Video in Chicago."}
{"input": "Ok now we're happy.  Excellent gelato. Many flavors.  We are happy they were open til 10 pm on Sunday cuz we showed up at 9:30.  We ordered stracciatella and chocolate.  Can't wait to come again to try another."}
{"input": "This is my first-ever Yelp review, and it's well-deserved. I went to Jean Madeline Aveda with hopes of getting a dye job gone wrong fixed. Going from pink to dark brown is a big project! Sarah took amazing care of me for the five hours I was there, doing a terrific job with color, highlights, and a blowout. I'm beyond happy with the work they did there, and the price cannot be beat! Five hours is a long time but there was a lot of work to be done and Sarah was a trooper all throughout - and very friendly and personable! I will definitely be going back to this salon in the future."}
{"input": "I'm not sure if it's 100% vegetarian, but their tofu and green beans is awesome."}
{"input": "after wine tasting at municipal winemakers around the corner (more for me), the bf wanted to do beer tasting here. $5 for the beer flight, where this month we tried 4 types of CA beers... if you buy a 6-pack for $12, your tasting is free... so we took advantage of basically the $7 6-pack. \n\nstaff was really friendly and i liked the decor. i wish they had stools around the bar because my feet were tired from walking up and down state st. :) they said they have different tastings every month, so might be good to come by with friends the next time we're in sb!"}
{"input": "we stopped in just to randomly check for a few things -- who knew you could find birch beer in Arizona! other than that, we snagged some Vosges chocolate (Mo's Bacon Bar is the BEST!), strawberry Pocky, and random other goodies. The prices are a bit high, but most items are imported or hard to find, so it's kind of understandable. I think we drooled over the bakery section for about 20 minutes -- everything looked AMAZING! nice place to find unusual ingredients, and really fresh meat and seafood."}
{"input": "This review is strictly of the food. I do plan to come back for wine, though. I ordered the garlic rosemary chips. Although they were only $2, I expected a little more. There were about as many chips as you would find in a lays snack pack! The rosemary was very strong, but I like rosemary so I didn't mind. My friend had the pesto bruschetta. If you love pesto, this is the snack for you. It came with two very small pieces of bread with a small amount of goat cheese but absolutely loaded with pesto. The stuff was dripping off. My friend actually had to take some off because it was overwhelming. The atmosphere at Tría is nice and the staff are relatively friendly. If you're coming for wine and cheese I am sure the experience will be more exciting."}
{"input": "The lady who works here is a miracle worker! I came in with a couple pairs of pants that needed to be hemmed, and a suit jacket whose sleeves needed to be shortened (both of which are not quick and easy, since suits are normally lined and it's a lot of work). I also needed it to be done fast - I was leaving the country the next day. Not only did she do all of these alterations in a day, they were also excellently done - neat and professional - and now I have a beautiful suit that fits me brilliantly for my business trip! Plus, they take all credit cards - including Amex! - and have very reasonable hours. \n\nDefinitely returning."}
{"input": "I eat at Sukho Thai quite a bit, and I don't really get the negative ratings. Is it the most authentic thai place in the area? No. Sometimes I would say they sometimes substitute certain ingredients. It is however usually pretty consistent as far as quality of food and service. \n\nI usually get the red or green curry, and almost always get it \"native thai hot\". I have tried other things on the menu, but they are not quite as good. So I stick with what tastes good and works for me. \n\nThe lady that owns the place is very kind and always very gracious to my wife and I. She always recognizes us and serves us promptly. She not only owns the place, but she waits all of the tables most of the time(which I think is pretty impressive). \nThe place is beside a go-cart track, so that makes it a little quirky, but it's something I have grown accustomed to. \n\nThe only thing negative I would say is that I wish they had Kee Mao on the menu, because that's my favorite. I usually go to Siam Cafe or Thai Star for that."}
{"input": "This place is great.  I brought by dog there at night during the week.  They were pretty busy but a nurse came out right away to assess my dog.  The nurses and doctors were terrific.  The cost was obviously a little more then my local vet, but being that it is an emergency room, I expected this.  The wait time (about 2 hours total I was there) was reasonable since it is an emergency room and they had some serious cases come in while I was there. ( I did chuckle at one of the other reviews who wouldn't give 5 stars because they waited an hour- its an emergency room!)  I wish my wait in the human emergency room was this short.  Anyway, great overall experience and I would definitely come back if I had to."}
{"input": "I love this place and it's a shame that it's never beer busy when I come here. Their food is amazing and the owners and staff are so friendly and attentive! This is my go to bbq place in the area and will always be! The owners live above it and really care about the place. She chatted with us about their catering orders, so that's something you may want to consider if you're looking to cater something. They also do carry out and you can call in a carry out order. The daily specials are separate for dining in and carrying out however :)"}
{"input": "The food was quite good, with the usual assortment of offerings.  We decided to take out -which this place is perfect for.  It is a bit hidden around the back of the shopping center, so it's not obvious to come across. However, this location (& plenty of parking) does make it a much more convenient local option for Indian takeout.  Plus, the prices are better than media too.  BYOB."}
{"input": "We discovered Beck's cafe at the Reading Terminal Market last weekend. Boy am I glad we did. My wife's family is from Louisiana and Mississippi, and have a long history of cooking cajun cuisine. We had the muffaletta sandwich and shrimp/crawfish etouffee. The etouffee was amazing and as good as what my father-in-law makes. The chef was knowledgeable about the holy trinity (celery, bell pepper, onion) and gave us a good tip on where to buy gumbo file powder. The bread pudding with pears and raisins was the best I've had since visiting New Orleans. We will have to go back for there breakfast beignets. They also have alligator on a stick!"}
{"input": "Great coffee and atmosphere right off of Kennedy, love the smells inside. Their cold brew coffee is strong and unique and their coffee that they market all over the tampa bay area is on the stronger side but for an experienced coffee drinker there's nothing better. Parking sucks at this location but if you can find a spot it's well worth the trouble. Support local business's!"}
{"input": "Just had a \"ramen\" delivered... All I'm going to say is, you're better off eating the instant ramen soup! First time I tried this place and I'm sure it will be the last."}
{"input": "Went to dinner with friends. Started out with the Beet and Goat Cheese Salad. It was very good. For the entree I had the fisherman's stew. It was good but not as good as I had hoped. Decent amount of seafood and a nice, but not great, broth. Also I couldn't understand why it wasn't served with bread. Would have been nice to be able to dip it in the sauce. Service was good and attentive. Atmosphere was fine."}
{"input": "I mostly go here for Sunday School and the 5 for $5 happy hour. Good stop for a Sunday Funday.\n\nThe wine and beers I have tried here have been pretty delicious, one stand out being a wine with hints of blueberry and white pepper, I wish I could remember the name!\n\nThe food here is good and reasonably priced, cheeses are paired with simple but delicious accompaniments. Standouts include the arugula salad with beets and goat cheese, and a white bean and artichoke panino.\n\nTria is a good place for a low key date or hang out with a friend."}

It always starts with the top and that is Dr Yaffe and his great staff follows  his lead .... Ron S"}
{"input": "Good bagels, but they can NEVER get an order right.  We live in NJ so when you ask for Taylor Ham and cheese you think they would be able to handle this.  \n\nInstead I get a ham and cheese sandwich, or an egg, ham and cheese sandwich.  I am DONE with this place.  City Market or Lumberville General Store will be my two choices from here on out."}
{"input": "Love the food. Big portions, interesting and ever changing menue. The only issues i have are that the seating is cramped, too loud for conversation and the coffe is not as good as Sabrina's.\n\nThe latkas are always perfect and the bacon is the best I ahve had in Philly."}
{"input": "Loved this tour! I grabbed a groupon and the price was great. It was the perfect way to explore New Orleans for someone who'd never been there before and didn't know a lot about the history of the city. Our tour guide had tons of interesting tidbits about the city, and I really enjoyed the experience. Highly recommended tour. I actually thought we were just going to tour through the cemetery, but she took us around the French Quarter for the first hour, and the cemetery for the second half of the tour. You'll meet up in front of a grocery store (seems strange at first, but it's not terribly hard to find, and it'll give you a chance to get some water), and you'll stop at a visitor center part way through the tour for a bathroom break if needed. This tour was one of my favorite parts of my trip!"}
{"input": "Tasty.  We ordered 5 different dishes and 3 different apps.  Scallion pancakes were delicious.  The garlic beef was very good.  My oldest who likes fish, ordered fish in pickled chili.  It was good but fried fish in a soggy sauce was mediocre.  Food came out fast but service was very good.  Home style tofu was very good but clashed with other dishes."}
{"input": "Anyone upset about this Company should know that the Owner tragically passed a few weeks ago. So - no, your calls will not be answered or returned. No - no one is controlling the emails, notices, etc. So if you continue to get notifications.... please, give the poor woman & her mourning family a break! She. Is. Dead! So save your crappy Yelp reviews for a business owner that can actually reply to you, fight back, make it up to you or just straight up has a Goddam heartbeat!  No need to tarnish anyone's reputation."}

{"input": "I have been desperately meaning to come here for a good three years.  Now I can finally check Cafe Ponte off my list.  My wife and I came here last night for our three year wedding anniversary.  \n\nI had purchased a Groupon a couple months ago for the 6 course tasting menu for two people.  At $85 for two people, it was a steal.  Still not cheap by any means, especially when you add in cocktails and I ordered the $35 wine pairing, but given the quality of food and service it was a nice deal IMO.  The additional amuse bouche, bread service (choices of focaccia, walnut/black olive, flatbread, and asiago loaf), and palate cleansers were a very nice touch as well.\n\nI would love to come back here!  EVERYTHING was top notch."}
{"input": "Great food. Awesome beer selection. Found this place by accident, definitely worth it. Can't remember the name of the burger I had, but it was topped with pork roll, onions and a fried egg."}
{"input": "All I heard was how good the food is...well, very average.  I wanted to give the highest rating-but, in all fairness I can't...very average at best...\nCool older building with the appropriate interiors but, that is where it ends unfortunately...\nCaveat Emptor...\nThe service was excellent!\nPat and Dennis"}
{"input": "LYING SCAMMERS. BAIT AND SWITCH. Will try and take advantage of you! Online coupon says 15$ for unlimited tanning any bed for a week for first time customers. Went to Chippewa location, The lady behind the desk acted like she had no idea what I was talking about. Then I pulled up the coupon and she said it's only for students and that I needed a student ID. However the coupon said nothing about this. Then she switched to saying the coupon is expired, yet it's still on YELP and they're website. She also said they won't honor the $75 for 45$ coupon you can literally purchase on yelp either. Just bullshit line after bullshit line. I then left And called creve coeur location and the lady there says, \"yes you can still use that coupon, but you must go to the same location each time for that week once you choose a location.\" I knew this as my girlfriend used it last week. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!!!!"}
{"input": "I'm not a regular waxer, but went in for a pre-vacation treat. The wax specialist Miriam was prompt and knew what she was doing. She spent much of our hour together telling me why my regular shaving is bad and waxing is good, and seriously marketing the EWC products to me. \nBrows and lower legs were done well. Underarms were left with a decent number of stray hairs which she told me I could tweeze out later. Little bits of wax were left on my skin here and there. Overall I felt like I did not walk out of there ready to hit the beach."}
{"input": "I love coming here especially today! My husband and I love coming here and sampling the fine donuts and sliders. Today we got some donuts to go (because it is so hard to pick just one or two). We got them home and the box collapsed in the middle and it was all bad for the tasty goodness that was our donuts. If you have ever had their donuts you know how sad this event was!!! So we went back to go buy replacements for our fallen donuts and we told the amazing staff what occurred. They not only gave us the donuts we ordered but gave us one on the house to replace the fallen donuts. Not only is the food amazing but the staff is too! Thank you for reinforcing my love of District Donuts!!"}
{"input": "I've become a fan of Sher-e Punjab over the last couple years despite agreeing with some of the same criticisms that have been voiced here by others.\n\nThe overpriced naan and charging for rice are a turn-off. Especially the rice. You may as well charge for ice in my water.\n\nI almost did a spit-take when I read Brooke's comment on the decor - so ridiculously true. The place is gaudy, but no more so than so many of your typical Asian-immigrant businesses. Just goes with the territory, like the golden Maneki Neko (beckoning cat), hookahs, fez's, etc.\n\nBut the main thing is the food, and the food is good - really good - really, really good. Their Vindaloo is spicy deliciousness, the okra dish (Bhindi Masala) is amazing, and the Biryani is so rich.\n\nI've found my favorite way to experience Sher-e Punjab is either to get it takeout or have Delicious Deliveries bring it to me. Throw a pot of rice on when you order and you'll be ready to go by the time it gets there."}

They were friendly and courteous the entire move. My interactions with the office staff during the booking and estimate was great too. I would definitely use CH again!"}
{"input": "Came to get lunch with some friends and man was this place packed. That's usually a good sign, but the room quickly became overcrowded with the line to order and the line to get drinks snaking throughout most of the room. We had two orders under one number at our table. ( you get a # and take a sign to display at your table. ) Well 2/3 of the people got their food within 10-15 min. One chicken BBQ sandwich plate and one pork. I was told that the amount of chicken in the sandwich was disappointing despite the yummy sauce.  The pork sandwich was on the dry side but ok. My nachos arrived around 40 minutes later only after reminding one of the runners twice I never received my food.  The nachos were okay. The pork BBQ was kinda dry but the sauces available were good. \nI plan to try this place again soon but so far I am less than impressed. Parking can be an issue also of note."}
{"input": "I really really wanted to like this place but didn't. The chicken wasn't great and not such a wide menu to select from. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and the place is cool but the food was bad."}
{"input": "Yea! Another Chick-fil-A!\n\nJust happened to be driving down (up?) Bloomingdale looking for a new spot to eat, and saw this. OK, it's not new food, but it is a new location (opened yesterday).\n\nThe parking lot is crazy, like many in FL, but the staff outside kept the drive-thru lanes flowing. I was in line for less than ten minutes. *Every* last employee I talked to, and I talked to six, were pleasant and welcoming, just like every Chick-fil-A I've ever been to.\n\nThe food was good of course, although the fries could have been cooked a bit longer. Chick-fil-A sandwhcih was on poojnt, and so was the sweet tea.\n\nWelcome to Bloomingdale CFA!"}
{"input": "Everything was delicious and fresh. The lunch specials are a great deal. I was told to order ahead of time but we didn't need to."}
{"input": "I can't believe this place gets ratings higher than 2 and people continue to eat there. The food is not good at all. I have accepted the fact that Nashville suffers a food void but this place is gross."}

{"input": "The worst sushi I have ever had. Huge pieces and weird rolls. Tried Bloomingdales role and the other roll that they recommend. Can't be any worse. There's potatoes or something with the roll. Weirdest event had. Strongly not recommend. Don't know how they got such a high review."}
{"input": "Great place. Came here after Christmas parade, very busy, did a good job keeping up with the rush of people. Food was great. Salsa should be sold on stores. Will be back."}
{"input": "Had a Habebero Bowl.  It was tasty and a good portion for the price.Hubs has Tamales and he said they were very good. They have a nice salsa bar as well. Only real ding I give them is that their guacamole was not very good. It was almost like it might have had mayo in it....YIPES!!!Guacamole also had a lot if onion in it.  I am a purest when it comes to guacamole. Atmosphere was nice and clean. Seems Family ran establishment. I give them extra credit for that."}

The guy called me back, told me he was making the pizza in a rush and wasn't charging me for it. 20 minutes later he came to the door himself with my Fresh, hot pizza and 2 brownies all for free. \nHe was very apologetic. Customer service was fantastic and food was awesome. This is my new go to delivery joint."}
{"input": "The first my hair was braided and I did not feel pain. I have a big head. My hair was completed in about 4 hours which was great time. Now the downfall is that my braider did not braid my hair pass the length of my natural hair which began to poof out weeks later because I do not have a relaxer. I used human hair because my scalp can no longer tolerate the synthetic hair that is normally used. I was a little upset afterwards because I had to take the braids out in 3 weeks time which was almost like a waste of money."}

{"input": "It is unfortunate that with such a unique location and such a brand and product offering this specific store offers such lousy service. The wait is endless, no one is available to help and at Christmas time getting a gift wrap is act of God that requires endless wait. I bought gifts and knew that the wait for wrapping would be long SO I even left my items at the store to be gift wrapped at their leisure. They were not even moved from the counter where I bought them when I returned almost two hours later ready for pick up. This was a gift that needed to be given and The staff COMPLETELY \"dropped the ball\" on my time constraints! \n\nI love their stuff, but today was my last shopping experience at this location: couldn't get a gift wrapped after being assured that it could be done in a timely fashion???  I'll  cancel my card, do everything online and try not to go there if I can. It's really a shame!"}

How many times have you been on the way back into an airport, and not found a gas station nearby? Happens to me to any times - often you have to go out of your way to find one. Not so here!\n\nPaid at the pump - I note that the pump had a hand scrawled note taped to the pumps - requesting you press the appropriate button (credit or debit) before swiping your credit card. Never seen this before - this is the exact opposite procedure of other gas station pumps when using a credit card!\n\nRefueled and was on my way to Hertz!"}
{"input": "I've decided to check this place out after a LONG wait at my regular nail salon. (also only 2 nail techs had me concerned, they work 6-7 days a week all day) anyway...  I walked into queen nail and spa and was pleased, even though crowded, I still was waited on immediately. I was happy with the service. Gel nail lasted almost 3 weeks ( has lasted that long every time I've gotten them done at queen spa) the staff is always professional (today I got a pedi and eyebrow wax by Kim and she was SO nice) the only reason I didn't give 5 stars (like others concerns) is how they clean their tools. Is spraying alcohol on the tools efficient?             hopefully i won't get some type of infection, if i never do it wont be a problem."}
{"input": "Too often people come to a casino restaurant and expect high class at all their dining establishments. And so you should, however one must understand that the price paid here is for the beef itself and should not be rated low because of pricing. Service was great and food quality was a close 10 for the price. I will eat here again."}
{"input": "Great place to stay if you want to be on Bourbon street.  The staff is really hospitable and didn't fail me on food choices.  The room is nice and big.  However, I stayed in room 263 and thought it was perfect because it was not a room that faced Conti.  I was wrong because it was closer to the vending and ice machines.  The door/wall was thin enough that I heard conversations in the hall next to the vending machines.\n\nI would have rated the hotel with 4 stars if it wasn't for the thin walls."}

{"input": "When I would frequent Spice Corner I was in college, broke, and not into cooking at all (unless \"cooking\" frozen foods counts). The only reason I'd go is to get loose teas at a reasonable price. I now regret not living closer because I've developed a taste for coffee and cooking, and Spice Corner serves the cook and coffee drinker with their diverse selection of spices and many flavored coffee beans. The only downside of this place is that it's quite small and it's difficult to maneuver around in. It's all worth it in the end, though. Your taste buds will thank you for visiting!"}

I have just tried the Dosas, Guess that after Uduppi closed down, the best dosa's in this vicinity are now available here.I drive in from Central Philly to Bensalem just for the South Indian food\nI tried the somosa's they were refried and not tasty at all, neither was the Chaat.\nLoved the pastries ( All of them taste the same,Pinapple flavor) Reminded me about the pastries back home in India.\nPicked up a packet of Pao (Mumbai's favorite street food Bun), as I make a mean Bhaji (The potato / Cabbage/Pea dish) they turned out really authentic."}

{"input": "Delicious! Everything from start to finish. Loved the ceviche, the enchiladas and finally the flan. Amazing!"}
{"input": "Really, more like 3.5 stars. Very clean, light-filled atmosphere. Waffles were light and fluffy and fruit was fresh and in season. Loved the pecan coffee.\n\nDownsides:\nUnfriendly cashier. I was really taken aback by the general demeanor of the young lady who took our order. No hello, thank you or anything else for that matter. \n\nTwo couples who came in after us grabbed tables while their partner waited in line, so we stood holding coffee and waters for about 10 minutes right by the coffee bar. I'd like to see Refuel be more proactive in preventing this, but I do appreciate the young man who was very friendly and broke up a 4 top table from one of the couples who snaked seats and squeezed the three of us in just as our food arrived.\n\nI will definitely head back to Refuel and I will continue to order BEFORE grabbing a table, and I hope you will too!"}
{"input": "Very American very bland no flavor. This had been on the bucket list for years to bad. The positive is the service is fast and nice. The table was clean and they have a fountain that is nice."}
{"input": "Friendly staff, good selection, fair prices."}
{"input": "One star isn't even low enough for how I am feeling right now. Wings over broadway use to be my favorite wing stop in Tucson until recently when we ordered 16 boneless wings. \n\nWe were DISGUSTED to find what appears to be parts of a worm inside of our wings. Usually service is alright. But that night they also happened to have the lady who appeared to be a manager lecturer one of her cooks for 10 minutes while people piled up at the counter for the one waitress on staff room orders and ran food to tables. \n\nNeedless to say, I will not be returning. And I truly do wish many others see this review and do not return as well. I spent 30 some dollars on horrible service and disgusting food."}

{"input": "When I first  heard a family member suggest going to this restaurant and describe it as a breakfast and a Mexican restaurant in one I was certain that it would be awful. I couldn't have been more wrong. The menu was huge and full of tons of options. Being a vegetarian I am always worried when going to a new restaurant but here you do not have to worry. They have vegetarian options that aren't normal available in authentic Mexican restaurant.  The portion size vs the price was reasonable. My aunt and I were able to take home left overs for a $8 meal, which is always a plus. \n\n\nThe service was fantastic even though there was only one cook and one waiter. She was very friendly and took her time when we asked questions about the menu. We also came there with a 1.5 year old and asked for specialty item (cup of fruit) and they were more than happy to make it for us without the usual  'sorry we don't offer that and I could probably get the cook to make that for you but I don't really care enough' look."}
{"input": "Hubby and I were looking for a fresh seafood restaurant and stopped here late on a Saturday afternoon. I ordered the tenderloin because I miss the good midwestern tenderloin sandwiches. For those. not from the midwest where breaded tenderloin was originated I'm sure they considered it great. BUT it was breaded with a much-too-garlicky seafood breading, NOT cracker crumbs as that are meant to be. I tasted that breading for hours afterward.  The fries were pretty good, however. The biggest problem is the restaurant was nearly empty and yet it took nearly 30 minutes to get our food.  Our waitress was very friendly but didn't apologize for the delay."}
{"input": "Wow. Just wow. This is a hidden gem that we stubbled across with AMAZING po-boys while showing some out of town friends the area. Seriously, the best little neighborhood joint with just yummy food. I had the catfish, mac and cheese, and jambalaya. Super cheap and the owners are some of the nicest people I've ever met. So sweet. \n\nFYI Cash only!!"}
{"input": "Cute location, there is a line, but pretty good food. Great location, but I was disappointed that when we arrived about 3:15, after being in line for about 15-20 minutes, we were informed that the ribs are only available at dinner time. Yes I rolled my eyes! But the cashier was very friendly and asked about how our trip was going so we decided to try out the pulled pork sandwich and several of their sides. Great food! Just disappointed I didn't get to try their ribs."}
{"input": "Great food and drinks, albeit overpriced I had the salt of the earth cocktail and it had great flavor. The angry chicken chicken taco was good, but one wasn't very filling. We had the shiitake, lemon and cauliflower pizza as an appetizer and it had good flavor as well."}
{"input": "My first time here, after getting a recommendation from a colleague. One of the best cubans i have ever had, including cubans from La Teresita in Tampa, and a few places in Miami. I will definitely be trying the other items on the menu, including the yellow rice & black beans, as well as the picadillo. \n\nWhat makes this family run business even better is the level of engagement each customer gets from the staff, most notably the owner and mother, who makes sure that you feel welcome and entertained. If you are looking for authentic Cuban staples, you absolutely have to experience this place."}
{"input": "Loved our breakfast here. They created a fresh veggie scramble for me that was delicious! Very friendly worker. \nCould use a bit more deep cleaning and decor but overall we all enjoyed our meal."}
{"input": "The food is terrific.  Not just the food -- the presentation.  The arroz con pollo I ordered came to my table artfully arranged on my plate.  And it was delicious, as was every part of my order.\n\nWhy the two stars?  As it seems others know all too well, the service was abysmal.  On one occasion, we waited interminably for a table, only to find out that the waiter thought we were part of another party, when there had been two seats available the whole time!  \n\nOnce we were served, the waitstaff ignored us.\n\nThis place seriously needs a management shakeup.  It needs a better manager, and a dedicated hostess/outside manager."}
{"input": "Went back to The Fat Ham last week and it is still amazing.  Consistent, delicious, and priced right.  Still no cookie dessert but glad it isn't featured on the updated website.  The Road Trip short film was very good! Kevin, the next time you are in Atlanta, must try Star Provisions cold fried chicken and 7 Lamps' mussels. Glad to have you in University City, Mr. Sbraga."}
{"input": "I almost always get Combo 5, with the juicy delicious 500 burger, truffle fries, and refreshing birch beer.\nLove the truffle fries.  \nI used to get food here at least once every two weeks, but the prices have gone up, especially for the fries. It's amazing how a $2 increase can change my eating pattern.\nIt's still one of the better burger places in Center City with a relatively reasonable price. If you haven't tried 500 Degrees yet, you should... before the price goes up again."}
{"input": "Amazing! Late night arrival in NOLA so got amazing service from Gary! Food was amazing. Highly recommend the seafood platter! Highest quality and freshness..."}
{"input": "We were new to Nashville and didn't know where to begin with baby furniture, strollers, etc... Fortunately, we found USA Baby. The staff is wonderful and very knowledgeable! Monica and Andrea spent so much time educating my husband and I and didn't pressure us into buying anything right away. We ended up purchasing our stroller, gilder, crib and dresser here. Monica and Andrea were our guardian angels through the entire process. There is so much you have to buy and you don't want to waste your money- they ensured we spent our money on quality products and allowed us to make our own decisions after educating us on all of the offerings in the store. Was so happy with the customer service and the inventory. Highly recommend!"}
{"input": "Well I did visit here a Year ago, long before the e.coli / colliform scare, so I have not been back out of concern for my health and safety. Darn shame too as I really did like this place, but I must admit that I still am not confident they have their act in order. My suggestion is they need to cook their meat longer and ensure it reaches optimum 165°F Temp, serve the food very hot temp to ensure bacteria are dead, and only source their greens and veggies from USA only sources. Avoid Mexico as they have big issues with water pollution cross-contamination."}
{"input": "We traveled from sunny Dunedin Florida to find the perfect dive bar. After arriving in New Orleans someone recommended the Backspace Bar. After visiting a few places and being disappointed in their service, we arrived at Backspace with an open mind. Vinnie was the bartender and his hair was as majestic as the cocktails. He recommended many local shots but we settled on his signature spicy tequila spirit that knocked us off our feet. Morgan cooked us a fantastic meatloaf sandwich that rivaled anything I've had at the Cheesecake Factory. Wow, what a wonderful place, everyone who visits this majestic city needs to visit this bar!"}
{"input": "extremely bad customer online support. only new vintages that is why they are cheap.\n\nthey are not interested in building long term clientele. their shiiping methods are terrible to say the least.\n\nwill never used them again\n\nxam\nmiami, florida"}
{"input": "So worth the wait! The crepes are amazing! I also loved the grits, which is rare. Tried my hubby's pancakes....awesome!"}
{"input": "This is the best Barber shop in the city. \n\nIf you've been to Aidan Gil in the last 7 years, chances are you got your hair cut by one of these barbers. Sarah, Nate, and Mike have been delivering the freshest haircuts to Aidan Gil customers for the better part of a decade, and now they have their own shop. They are all great barbers and great people. \n\nThe atmosphere is light and fun, it's like you're getting your haircut in your friend's living room. The haircuts are always on point, the fades tight, and the shaves close. \n\nGo in, get a drink, relax and watch some TV while you wait, refill your drink and enjoy your cut/shave."}
{"input": "I had THE best sushi and filet with scallops here! This is a true neighborhood gem. This is our new go-to place for Japanese."}
{"input": "It really upsets me that Five Star pizza does NOT have five stars. Really great pizza. Do not get the cinnamon bite things. The pepperoni bites are super yummy. Their pizzas are very large and nicely priced. Always coupons/deals on their website when you order. Food is usually ready to be picked up in 20-30 minutes. Their staff sucks but just I ignore it."}
{"input": "Great mix of seasonal vegetables, lightly seasoned with an artful presentation. Wonderful flavor on the French minestrone soup. Service was prompt and attentive and the atmosphere was perfect for a business lunch on a snowy afternoon."}
{"input": "Excellent food, ambiance and location! I ate there for lunch during this trip to NOLA with my friend. I had the artichoke and crab salad - it was SO good! My mouth waters thinking of it now. My friend ate the grilled and roasted vegetable platter and everyhing was excellent! I highly recommend!"}
{"input": "First, location...if you are staying near the French quarter, this place is a little bit of a hike but for a calmer night in New Orleans, this is a great spot.\n\nThe crowd is mainly 30+ year olds that appreciate great wine, cheese and jazz. \n\nThe layout is a but odd though. You walk through a wine shop and can buy your own bottles and cheese. You choose your sizes and cheese types from their fridge.  Then you go into a cool backyard patio area where there is a live band and pick a seat. For food, there is a small window to order from which is CASH ONLY.  The food is ok. It's not the best of NOLA but it is tasty.  The portion sizes are very good for the price.\n\nI'd definitely come back for ambiance, wine and cheese but maybe not a full meal."}
{"input": "I have always enjoyed this chain. I've been here so many times, I'm surprised this is my first time leaving review. Anyway, we stopped in, and shared a salad and Greek quesadillas (I think they gave it a quirky name but I can't remember it).\n\nThe food came out quickly and tasted good as always. So why the 4 stars and not 5? Well the staff of 3 were sitting at a table right by the register, and they all looked miserable. I looked their way and smiled when I was standing there two feet away ordering, and nothing, from any of them. It was just weird. Additionally, we were charged full price for those quesadillas even though we didn't have any meat. They ended up just making us extra quesadillas. And lastly, it was FREEZING inside. I can't imagine sitting there eating, so we sat outside.\n\nOverall it was a good experience. Yeah there are tweaks to be made, but the food is very good."}
{"input": "Created order and PAID in Yelp app got to shop and was asked to pay again. Explained I paid in Yelp app, clerk insisted she knew nothing about getting paid, spent five minutes on the phone and finally nudged sandwiches to me without even a simple I'm sorry. Got home and sandwiches turned out to be disappointing. Lack of customer service and poor quality of food will keep me from returning."}
{"input": "I have lived in 3 majors cities across the US, 2 foreign countries, and although I have only been to PP twice, it is hands down the best pancake I have ever had. Sorry, Mom. \nAnd you don't even have to get the crazy Sweet Potato or Buckwheat stylings to get something special. Just get regular old Buttermilk, they are perfect. They are the pancake ideal. \nI was here for the first time about 5 years ago. It was amazing. I just went back for the second time, the memory of my first visit in my mind, and I was just praying it was as good as I'd remembered. It was."}
{"input": "Oh! First off, it smells delicious!\n\nSecondly, it tastes delicious!!\n\nWe didn't know that our order of chicken came with a donut so we had ordered donuts, too, which we ended up not being disappointed about. \n\nThey probably didn't tell us that they came with donuts because they just thought we wanted more...? Who knows. \n\nI ordered sweet garlic wings, the hubs ordered the combo of buttermilk ranch, and we shared in order to try different flavors. They were both scrumptious but I preferred my sweet garlic. And the donut that came with it was so juicy which sounds weird but then later someone outside of the restaurant had told us it was a honey donut which made sense. \n\nWe also ordered the guava donut forgot what it was called though, and that too despite sounding weird was really yummy. \n\nAnyway, gave it 4 stars for now cos it was my first time and it was good. It'll have to wait for my return in an estimated year or so to get bumped up to a 5."}
{"input": "Tried it tonight for the first time. Just tried basics to start, chicken in garlic sauce, shrimp fried rice, wonton soup and shrimp rolls..  All was tasty.  My husband thought the shrimp rolls could have used more flavor but I thought they were just fine. This area has needed a good chinese takeout for a long time.  I plan to try it again soon."}
{"input": "Sadly, Hobbs the Liger has passed away. \n\nWhich leaves the bird display (sponsored by a local bird-fancier group) as the best attraction: the birds looked happy and entertained, sitting on their perches under the trees. \n\nAs for the rest of the zoo....well, it's a roadside zoo. Small enclosures, some of them empty (maybe those animals died), some designed so it's hard to see the animals, missing, incorrect, and illegible informational signs, etc. I wish they had more information on the animals: where did they come from? How did the zoo acquire them? \n\nThat said, the kids appeared to be enjoying the petting zoo, and I was pleased to see so many happy-looking teen-aged volunteers."}
{"input": "Wow is all I have to say. Must try the friend oysters!we ordered that and crawfish bisque and shrimp with grits. All the dishes were delicious. Make sure to make reservation."}
{"input": "Awesome HH in Webster! For one, HH goes until 7pm so there's plenty of time to get there after work (and get at least a couple drinks in on HH special :-) ). They have $5 cocktail/draft beer specials and certain $2.50 bottles. They also have a number of bar eats for $5-$8. Per Yelp's recommendation I tried the Potted Pig and it was a fantastic plate of food. The pork confit has a pastey/tuna-like texture; on its own it's a tad too pork-y but with the pickled veg and grape chutney you get a nice balance of salty, sweet, and acid in each bite. I also appreciate that the bread is grilled and seasoned. These little details make a difference.\n\nI also like the ambience. Relaxed, rustic-hipster. They sell some of their own meats at the front counter - bonus points in my book."}
{"input": "I am a long term frequent customer of this establishment. I just went in to order take out (3 apps) and was told they're too busy to do it. Really? The place is maybe half full at best. Does your dick reach your ass? Yes? Go fuck yourself! I'm a frequent customer AND great tipper. Glad that Kanella just opened. NEVER going back to dmitris!"}
{"input": "Excellent boba, happy/friendly/helpful service, spacious dining area.\n\nI've had the mango snow smoothie with boba and matcha milk tea with half boba and half pudding at half sweetness. The matcha milk tea was perfect. Strong matcha flavor, just the right level of sweetness, perfectly cooked boba, and good pudding. I was really happy that the barista asked me about sweetness level because I didn't realize they allowed customization.\n\nThe mango, I will probs not get again. Was syrupy and overly sweet (before I knew to ask for reduction in sweetness) and tasted a bit too artificial for me. I will have to  stick to the milk teas. Also wish they added a few more bubbles.\n\nThe baristas are exceptionally friendly and always patient with my indecisiveness. Service is quick and drinks are always served with a smile. A smile and good milk tea definitely make my day!"}
{"input": "Just about as good as all the BBQ places around. First time today and spot on. Pulled pork dam good as was the sausage. You can always tell a good BBQ joint by the smoked sausage. Great job."}
{"input": "I've been reading the bad reviews on this page, and they make me wonder if the reviewers have been to the same location I was at. I found the place spotlessly clean, and everyone was friendly to a fault. I'd like to give a special shout-out to Maisha (probably spelling that wrong), who was on duty at about 6:30 PM on Friday, October 16, 2015. She treated me and every other customer like we were her best friends - making sure everyone had everything they needed. Great experience!"}
{"input": "They have some ridiculous number of martinis featured...I think it's 500 (give or take a 100). They also have petron margaritas, which you can purchase in pitcher form. Let me repeat: GIANT PITCHERS OF PETRON POMEGRANATE MARGARITA GOODNESS! Why are you still sitting there? \n\nPrices are reasonable, but not cheap. That shouldn't stop you. Also, the people that work there offer fabulous service and are willing to hold your hand while you wade through the menu (if they have the time...these girls are busy!)"}
{"input": "We came here tonight just for a date night. We started with some basics of edamame and tuna tartare, the tartar took me back to California, the taste of fresh ocean and soft creamy avocado was just to die for. Then we had some creamy rock shrimp that had a tiny bit of spice at the end which was pretty good too. We also had the Miso soup which was one of the best miso soups we've had. This was followed by our version of surf and turf where we had sushi rolls and their steak. We were nothing but satisfied with all of the flavor profiles we were able to enjoy during this entire meal. If you get a chance please check this place out they also have amazing cocktails."}
{"input": "Went there last night for the first time ever, the bartender was extremely helpful. I ordered the wings, definitely in my top 3 wing spots. I've traveled all over and eaten wings religiously. The only place I know that would trump their wings is Atkins park in atlanta, they deep fry them in duck fat though. Pizza looked questionable. Im going to go back soon and try their burritos."}
{"input": "Meh, it didn't blow my mind, but it was okay.  I think some of the meats were overdone.  The filet mignon was not tender.  The ribs were very tender and that was about it.  They could have done better on differing the rubs and the meats were not diverse as some Brazilian that I have had.  Luckily we didn't know about the special running and it wasn't really expensive, otherwise I would have gone to two stars"}
{"input": "Great food good times if your looking  for a great time this is the place hands down the staff are professional and always taking care of their customers tell unsweetened tea comes in a huge glass and the food comes in huge portions the customers are nice and will hold a great conversation with you as well."}
{"input": "Our first time to fly Alaska & we were a bit apprehensive due to the service we received from united - we just felt Americans just don't know how to be courteous to airline passengers because there really is a BIG difference in how passengers are treated when we fly via Korea Air, Japan Airlines & the BEST, All Nippon Airways - they are amazing. But to our delight, Alaska was great!  Not a whole lot of room but that they just treated people like...people. They did not act like gods & goddesses who treat passengers like slaves who are waiting for their mercy.  \nOverall, a highly-recommended airline!"}
{"input": "Our family returned for breakfast again this weekend and the food and service was again impeccable ... Highly recommend"}
{"input": "Horrible Customer Service. I asked for a quote on my car from damages from the tornado. I thought he wrote everything down and he called me several times so that I can repeat the damages. The next day, I called to notify Vic that 2 of my small windows that I originally thought were broken are actually intact. I asked him could he adjust the quote and he told me to just subtract the price from the other windows. He was so frustrated that I requested the quote he hung up the phone or so he thought. He thought he hung up and proceeded to vent his frustrations about me loudly and rudely to whomever was in the shop. I stayed on the phone until he picked it up to express why I would not patronize his establishment. I understand that Vic is reasonable, but you get what you pay for and that's lack of respect and customer service by the owner!"}
{"input": "Got the cheese steak pizza. It was very good and came out quickly. Service is you order at the counter and pickup when ready. No need for tipping. I would recommend as the selection is well rounded and you can't beat all organic for a good price."}
{"input": "Great company! I called needing my locks changed at my house and they were here in literally 20 minutes. I would recommend to anyone. Thank you for your fast service!!"}
{"input": "This place is a little harder to find but worth the hunt. B's Diner is a little hole-in-the-wall joint populated by neat antiques, funny posters, and the warmth and personality of their staff. They do incredible work in the community and they are worth supporting.\n\nIf you are looking for an affordable meal or are looking to have a hearty bite at somewhere chill- this is your spot. It's got that great diner feel and the personality is all in the food.\n\nI think part of the fun is the people-watching at this joint. Whyte ave bar staff the morning after, hipsters, musicians- never a dull moment.\n\nI've heard the Elk sausage and perogie poutine is amazing, but I've yet to try it."}
{"input": "Meh. The promise of a well-made cocktail somehow was not fulfilled on a busy Saturday night. Pity, because we were so looking forward to this place. Made me feel so much better about our cocktail bar back home, which has a consistency that Loa seemed to be lacking. Though I had to practically beg for a cocktail menu, at least the bartenders were nice and willing to accommodate after all.\n\nNeither of our cocktails were balanced - mine, too sweet; my companion's, too sour. The strong piped-in artificial floral... citrus... whatever aroma in the hotel lobby, where we were forced to sit due to the large and noisy crowd in the tiny bar, also did not help me enjoy my cocktail one bit. My companion was more of a fan of the minimalist atmosphere, but I'll take comfort over style any day."}
{"input": "Today's 1st time visit to Ippolito's was fantastic! I love the fresh selection of seafood. I had the tuna cheesesteak and I very much enjoyed it. But felt remorse for I had just finished coming from the gym but the sesame roll was undeniable. Josiah is awesome and we talked seafood for we were both fanatics and he hooked me up with a fresh complementary piece of fish which I promptly seasoned and baked as soon as I got home! Good job folks!"}
{"input": "This little bar within peppermill is prime real estate if you're still awake with all the other night owls. Cozy up to the bar and make sure troy is working. He's friendly enough to ask where you're from and tell you about the week's upcoming specials, even when every seat is full (at 2 a.m.). \n\n$1 food specials are killer. Free drinks if you're gambling go really well with dollar prime rib sliders and crispy French fries. Don't go to bed when you're done in the casino. Come here and make it a night!"}
{"input": "Food is great. Service is wonderful, yet a little slow. We really enjoy dining here and we love the tacos and bowls."}
{"input": "The food was good, had the cornbread waffles and they were amazing. Also got the hashbrowns which were a little too greasy for my taste. They do have fresh squeezed orange juice! Its a little noisy inside due to the kitchen not being completely separated from the dining area. Overall I would recommend!"}
{"input": "This is nice little Chinese bakery in the heart of Philadelphia's Chinatown! The female cashier was very friendly (flirtatious!) and the pastries shown in nicely adorned display cases. I stopped by early one evening had a sesame ball, which was filled with bean paste. The glutinous rice of the ball was nicely flavored, similar to Bai Tang Gao. Definitely as place worth stopping at if you are in the area."}
{"input": "Best spot to eat in Doylestown. The food is consistently good, the staff is friendly, the drinks are awesome, the atmosphere is so cool since it's connected to the Doylestown inn. I feel like this is a staple to the town and I'm glad it's being managed by extremely competent and friendly people that continue to make it better.  Try the steak house benedict with one of the wide variety of delicious and potent cocktails and you wont be sorry."}
{"input": "Stopped in while aimlessly wandering around Philly looking for lunch and a beer. I was not disappointed. Place is clean and they were playing Stevie Van Zandt's Underground Garage Radio nice and loud. My kind of place. Great beer selection and the cheeseburger was excellent."}
{"input": "My daughter and I ate here for the first time yesterday... She didn't want to wait the 5 to 15 minutes to be seated and was like mom can you take me to IHOP.. Uugh no.. When I tell you the food and service was THEE BEST!!! We will be back...Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.\n\nPlease don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"input": "Last week, my husband and I went on the swap tour (it was about 2 hours in length). Our captain was amazing: as a native, he knew just about everything in terms of the habitat and history. Knew all about the wildlife and he made the tour SO fun. Saw tons of gators, and the tour guide caught soft crabs and snails for us to pass around. We were in Nola for 5 days and this was definitely a huge highlight!!"}
{"input": "The rooms are very updated with a great tv, work area and furniture.  The set up of the tv in relation to the bed was weird but I guess they couldn't put the TV in front of the windows. I was also excited how close Chinatown was located."}
{"input": "Tried to buy a phone from the AT&T at Moorestown mall and then came here -- and Russell was awesome. He answered all of my questions and was patient with me being indecisive of what phone I wanted to buy. We wound up buying a phone, smart watch, and direct TV. He even helped us get a great deal on our plan. Russell deserves a raise!"}
{"input": "We had SO much fun on this tour!\n\nWe booked for Hallowe'en day, bright and early and showed up (of course) in costume. Our tour guide was a woman with a huge love for NOLA and that really shone through. She wore a big billowing cape and made us feel right at home in our costumes! \n\nAlthough the tour was a cemetery tour, she took us around NOLA a little bit first so we had some context and background of the city and its architecture. Upon reaching the cemetery we saw that there were tons of other tour groups there - our guide was great at ushering us around and through the maze of narrow passageways to give us the most personal experience possible. \n\nBestie and I had an amazing time doing this tour, both being totally crazy about tours like this! Even though we didn't see any ghosts, this definitely deserves five spooky stars!"}
{"input": "There is not much to say about Joes or \"Chinks\" if your a long time local. It is a little more expensive than other local cheesesteaks, but you know what your paying for. The meat is much higher quality than most places. I have had plenty of Philly cheesesteaks. Genos, Pats, Tony Luke's, Jim's....... still prefer joes over any of those."}
{"input": "Driving through the area and looking for a place to grab a bite. The food is outstanding and the staff was supper nice. I wish I had a local like this near me!"}
{"input": "The service was uninviting and made my group feel unwanted.  When we arrived it was towards the end of the brunch on Sunday.  The host was not friendly and gave the feeling of us being a burden to them. Once pointed to self seating and having a seat, the waitress brought waters but we were left without menus.  I went to the front to inquire about menus but the waitress has jumped in front of me after over hearing my wife ask me about the menus.  I apologized and told her we didn't know if we were suppose to get our own menus or if they would be brought to us.  She just stared not indicating anything.  I just walked back to our seats with her where she handed us the manus and then walked away again not saying anything.  After sitting for a few minutes my wife and I didn't know if we were suppose to order at the bar or with the waitress and at this point I was annoyed with the service and decided we should just leave.  I will never go here again!"}
{"input": "This place lives up to the reviews here. walked right in and belly-upped to the bar. Enjoyed the poppin music ft a string bass, viola, guitar and a stand in clarinet.  Vocals were really good. too much The Sandlot, yes the kid movie with James Earle Jones and Dennis Leary on rotation behind the bar, but if that's the low point, it ain't bad"}
{"input": "Old World Coffee. Where to start?\n\nI don't drink coffee very much. Okay, I don't drink coffee at all. My drink of preference would be hot cocoa, occasionally spiced. I never doubt the quality of the drink here, because the milk is really quite good. Also, some of the baristas here have some stunning latte art. Don't know what that is? You should ask one of them, they're all very experienced with what they're talking about. That's another great reason to come here - not only is there quality of service, but there's also friendliness. The baristas are always very kind, helpful, and informative about what it is they do. \n\nNot only is everything about the service great, the atmosphere is really cool too. I often find the art that they put up on their walls interesting and unique, and they change it out about once a month. The wood and white theme they have going on is very aesthetically pleasing, as well as nicely calming. \n\nThis is definitely one of my favorite places to go!"}
{"input": "Best pizza in town. Staff is always friendly, especially Jordan. The pizza is good priced, less than $9 and a good size. There is a variety of toppings and its unlimited toppings. It's easy and is pretty fast, only 5 minutes for a pizza. I recommend herb butter for the oil and barbecue for the sauce. Welcome to the neighborhood."}
{"input": "Highly recommended!! Excellent food, great service!! Came to the quarter looking for something authentic. We found exactly what we were looking for and more. The shrimp creole was fantastic! It went great with the local blonde ale. Our waitress, Delores, was an absolute delight. Great overall experience!"}
{"input": "I first emailed through Yelp for a basic quote and received a quick response, and was also told about the discount from being a Yelp user. I called and asked if I needed to make an appointment but it was just recommended that I bring my car in early in the morning to ensure it's ready by the end of the day. The ladies up front are super communicative and up front about all charges before they went ahead with the work. They ordered new parts that arrived the same day. As a female in my 20s I'm always hesitant to visit new shops when I move to a city, but I felt confident in the work they did here."}
{"input": "Really good food and great service! They have their own fish market right next door so I bought Jambalaya and Gumbo to take back to Miami!"}
{"input": "My rating is based on the food.  The service and decor are obviously lacking.  Go for lunch or late evening.  The tasting menu is your best bet.  I've gone three times.  They'll send extras, more of something you liked and you'll get to sample items you wouldn't normally order."}
{"input": "Our dinner was amazing but it's was the service that sucked.\nWe asked for booth got seated at a table repeated that we wanted a booth so many booths was available the hostess goes those are for a later party(later came & no it wasn't) but there was one booth just needed to be clean she clean it really quick then we sat down took a min for our waiter to ask what we want for our drinks once order they came out quick. Then we order our food. Took a long time for salads & the biscuits our main meal came out first it was bought out by someone else & not waiter by time we found our waiter he said he thought the girl bought out our salads & biscuits. He said he'll take care of it that took a minute to come out as well. We ate our main meal then salad & biscuits. Yeah it's all going in the same place but it's certain order we wanted to eat our food & this first time I had to wait a while on simple service at least bring out the biscuits right at the beginning"}
{"input": "I come here all the time.  They have a great beer selection.  They have great service in the bar.  The dining area can be really slow, but I always go when it is busy, so that might explain it.  \n\nLove the taco salad with beef, the wings, sandwiches and the ovals!"}
{"input": "Another Chestnut Hill gem! \nTheir homemade pasta is delicious and has the perfect texture that you look for at a good Italian restaurant. Our party of 6 arrived late to our reservation unfortunately because of the weather conditions that evening. The staff still greeted us and seated us with friendly faces.\nI had their pasta dish that comes in a white sauce topped with crab meat, asparagus, and roasted tomatoes (sorry I'm unable to remember what it was called and it's not on their website's menu). It was a lighter option but still very flavorful and delicious. However, the star on their menu has to be their pasta in a cream sauce of beef and mushrooms. Three members of our party ordered this dish and everyone made sure to have a bite of it. Rich and creamy deliciousness!"}
{"input": "Quaint little restaurant food was absolutely lovely! Service was friendly and the food was simple and delicious"}
{"input": "I love this food truck. They have the tastiest street foods like their captain crunch tilapia burrito. Who would've thought of that? The fried fish is so flakey and delicious, paired with fresh cabbage, tomatoes, avocado and Sriracha mayo. I have also tried their katsu and curry chicken which are so rich in flavor. Their Thai tea is also on point! So much to offer from a small food truck. I live in Jersey and I have driven here many times just to get food. They are so friendly and provide great food at a great price."}
{"input": "I love this place, especially the cheese sticks! Hookah, atmosphere, sports games on the TV's, nice vibe and great place to meet/mingle with different people!"}
{"input": "The 5 stars are well earned!  Gabrieal is awesome and helped me get tires for my RV and now has fixed my 1993 4Runner.  I will always go to these guys for anything i need on my cars."}
{"input": "I called in an order for a chicken dish, and it was hot and ready 10 minutes later when I arrived.  The owner was very friendly and made some conversation.  The food was hot and tasty.  The ingredients were made well, with good flavor and texture.  I got chicken and a coke and the total was roughly $10, and I was stuffed.  I would definitely go back there again."}
{"input": "Heard this place from a friend. Also food and people here! Very clean! Highly recommended"}
{"input": "Never been dissatisfied here, and what's more we're always thoroughly impressed. Speedy, friendly service paired with fairly priced food of great quality with clean and unique dining area. Bathrooms are kept up extremely well with the amount of foot traffic they see too. Kudos to the manager and hard-working team there!"}
{"input": "Top 10.. delicious food, great freindly service.. English Breakfast was perfect.Highly Recommended.. stay away from the\"Pond\" go here instead"}
{"input": "I grew up in the south and love Popeyes, by this one is horrible! It takes 10+ minutes to get your order. Last time we went, we got to the window and told us they were out of gravy :( and when we got home our food was cold (and not from the drive, we live less than a mile away). Sadly, we won't be returning. I wish this Popeyes was better."}
{"input": "They served me a frozen pizza and skunked beer.  'Nuff said."}
{"input": "Nice location, great food selections and good coffee. Had the French toast it was pretty tasty. Overall good experience and friendly staff."}
{"input": "I used to love to go to this place back in the late 1980s when it was on Pine Street. Then it was a great place for brunch and ice cream. When I took my children to the current location a few weeks ago, we had small ice cream cones that were over-priced and the staff was not terribly helpful. The person who waited on me left my receipt with credit card info. sitting on the counter while she disappeared outside to pick up lunch down the street. However, the real turn-off is the price. Go to Franklin Fountain instead! They have a better selection at more reasonable prices in a more attractive setting."}
{"input": "You've got a lotta nerve calling your place New York Pizza. First and foremost, the very worst pizza I've ever had in New York is a million times better than anything to ever be produced by this poor excuse of a pizza place. New York Pizza, PLEASE! What you make can barely be called pizza, period. And for all of you people giving more stars, I don't know what they are paying you, but I hope it is a lot. And it you are not being paid, PLEASE, get out more, and go some place good, cause this ain't it."}
{"input": "My review is from a Sat brunch visit. I've never been at night so it could be quite good as a bar to frequent.\n\nThat said their breakfast was OK, nothing to write home about - in fact there's a cafe right across the street (cafe lift) and I would argue they have a much more tasty brunch option. That said this place definitely has great options for watching games and seating with groups at a bar."}
{"input": "Food and service was great! Try the BLT and the egg rolls! The drinks are so good as well."}
{"input": "The Smoked Salmon Frittata came with the smoked salmon, egg, potato, red bell peppers, goat cheese, horseradish -dil crema & fresh fruit. And it was as good as it sounded \n\nA very good mod dat brunch, dinner, and private dining spot."}
{"input": "Perfect place for a date night. The sweet potato nachos and the \"breakfast\" we're to die for! Really everything we tried was delicious...I can't wait to go back again."}
{"input": "This place used to be fantastic! But since the smoking ban, the management is acting scared. Perhaps it is a necessary business model to charge for an extra clean plate upon which to share our items with eachother, but it feels greedy. The food is great. The drinks are great. The service is hit and miss.  We have had some great servers who are attentive, happy, kind, helpful. But we have had some who seem to be too busy hanging out in the bar to be attentive to the dining room. I would give this place 5 stars if not for the poor service at times, and the charge for an extra plate. So if you dont mind some of the servers who seems like they dont care about your needs, and if you dont mind paying a couple of bucks to use an extra plate, then you might like this place.  We have been going for decades, but not so much now that the service is lacking, and the greed(fear) has set in."}
{"input": "Busy location, slow stuff! Clean and always well stocked! Good drinks they cold be a little faster but I still love Starbucks !"}
{"input": "I've done a lot of business with Cristalvetro over the past 7 years and never had a problem until recently. I sent in an order with a deposit back in February, and never heard from them. When I started to follow up a few months ago they never returned my calls or emails. I eventually went into their storefront and was told that my top was in their Brooklyn warehouse and could get delivered the following week, I called to follow up on the delivery and was told that the top was damaged and they could not deliver it and would remake it. That made me think that they were lying about having it ready at all. I gave it a few more weeks and heard nothing after many more unanswered calls and emails. At this point I doubt I will ever get my table top or my deposit from them, I will not do business with them again."}
{"input": "The service and food was outstanding!! I will definitely be a return customer here. The helpings are respectable and worth the money. I can see why they have a really high rating!!"}
{"input": "Terrible service from the bar tender. Unless you are a regular she did not serve us. I was standing at the bar with money in my hand and she just kept going to the same old people. Very irritating!"}
{"input": "Good coffee. Great cheesecakes and ice cream. Awesome to be able to walk / bike to get a cuppa."}
{"input": "The cafe was extremely cute. We came at 8am and they even had a jazz band playing at that time. I got the breakfast sandwich and it was delicious. I loved how they rolled the egg and put the bacon pieces inside. Great price for a filling breakfast!"}
{"input": "It's my first time here and the service is slow. The employees don't have good attitude but the food it's good."}
{"input": "Wow, the selection is extraordinary here... I think mainly because they never turn anyone away who wants to sell.  With that in mind, expect to label your items, and drop them off.  You'll get a call later, after they've gone through your items.  You may be surprised what they decide to keep and what they don't... but personally, I think it comes down to the fact they already have so much inventory.  I wish there were more locations- to be honest- as this one is so packed, it's almost overwhelming to shop.  HOWEVER, I always do find good things for my kids whether clothes, shoes or toys, so I highly recommend Once Upon a Child for second hand items."}
{"input": "We caught an Uber here and they wouldn't admit us with my backpack, nor check the backpack, nor search it. We had to miss our movie and wasted $30 on Uber fare there and back. Shitty."}
{"input": "Great location and hotel has great character. The hallways stink though and the staff is not really that friendly.  Clean comfortable room  so go there for the location."}
{"input": "New restaurant in the neighborhood. Finally opened on Saturday. We wandered in with high expectations. Good variety of Vietnamese food. Ample amount of food and tasty.  Good value."}
{"input": "The pork chop was fine but the wahoo was over cooked and dry. To their credit, they comped the wahoo dish. Service was poor. Waiter was overwhelmed with the number of tables he was tending to. Ambience was less than romantic and very loud. We heard good things about Muriel's but it fell way below expectations."}
{"input": "My wife and I stoped in for a couple of glasses of wine in the bar area.  It was a nice festive atmosphere.  Santa and Mrs. Clause even made a brief appearance.  The service was a little slow but we were ok with it because we wanted to take our time anyway.  We had a good time and the ambience is nice for a drink or 2."}
{"input": "2nd time here on Saturday at 6. Reservations were for 615 seated at 7 PM. Hostess said 20 minute wait, significantly underestimated. Same thing happened first time around. Understaffed. Squeeze you in at each table.12 people at each table only room for nine. Not enough room for dishes and drinks. Food is good but everything else below acceptable."}
{"input": "I imagine this place gets super busy during the week, but I stopped by for a weekend brunch and had no issues getting in. Delicious food, pretty space. I'll be back."}
{"input": "Nice thai massage...\nThe massage is really nice and it's Thai Shiatsu style. It's calming and relaxing...really opens up the body."}
{"input": "This place is amazing! A family owned restaurant that makes the best mini chimis... a must try!"}
{"input": "A coworker recently talked me into going to lunch at Smiths and I was surprised to have an awesome meal.  There was this amazing salad on the menu that had all my favorite foods.  I ordered a kale salad, served with sauteed butternet squash, prosciutto and topped with sea bass. So good! \n\nI'd give Smith's 4 stars, but the service was not the best.  We called in advance to make reservations for a group of 7 and were told they didn't take reservations.  When we arrived, the first thing we were asked was if we had resevations.  What???  Annoying.  We ended up sitting and waiting, getting very little updates from the hostess.  \n\nNot the best service, but I'd go again for the food."}
{"input": "Although far from home, I did like this store. Great produce and sales. Meat and fish are very pricy. They carry items I cannot find elsewhere.Great bulk item section.  Wish it were closer."}
{"input": "Real Thai food and they'll make it spicy if you ask for it pet pet. I really like both their soups. The curries have excellent flavor but they can seem runny if you're not used to Thai curries. I'm not super thrilled with the eggrolls but my girlfriend always gets the veggie ones. Perhaps the meat ones are better."}
{"input": "Excellent food.  Great service.  Best Miso Soup I have ever tasted.  They have an extensive menu.  My family's favorite Chinese Restaurant."}
{"input": "Great selection of local authors, classics, fiction, and non-fiction. Prices are of course more than the Internet, but it is not a chain store either, it is so much better experience than that!!!\n\nIt is a great place for writers and readers alike to enjoy! \n\nHighly recommended!"}
{"input": "The food here is very good, little over priced for being in a strip mall and having no real ambiance but the food reminds me of  restaurants  in Center City, so I keep going back! Would definitely recommend!"}
{"input": "Will never go back to this location - they threw away the birthday gift my little niece made for me - WTF?"}
{"input": "Fun independent store for holiday gifts. Pleasant staff. Hooray."}
{"input": "Great vibe, decor and music were on point. Had the hoppy poppy beer and the tuna tatlaaaa"}
{"input": "The tomato soup was great. \nBut my pizza...wow. So. Bad. It was soggy and the crust was squishy. I could have rung it out like a dish rag. So gross."}
{"input": "Nicest people I have ever met in my life!  The decor was lovely and we enjoyed the aquarium video. Very good Korean food.  The vegetable side dishes were great and they were kind enough to bring us more when we ate it up.  Pretty good japchae and beef bulgogi.  My older daughter is our Korean food fanatic and she loved her vegetarian stone pot dish.  We enjoyed it very much, but not the best Korean food we've ever eaten.  Because of my older daughter, we eat Korean food everywhere we go.  Surprisingly, we have had amazing Korean food in Charleston, SC. Also Washington, DC.  But this place was very good and had a wonderful feel."}
{"input": "Amazing shoe store with hand picked selection.  Find shoes you wouldn't find elsewhere.  Staff is very helpful."}
{"input": "Very cozy place to have a drink with friends.  The drinks were tasty and were served in very pretty glasses reminiscent of those some of our grandmothers had in their china cabinets. On the downside, all of the drinks seemed to have some combination of ginger, lime, and honey with the main difference being the kind of liquor you wanted in your drink.  So the choices felt limited.  I ordered the bacon wrapped dates, and have to admit that I was choking them down because I was hungry.  They tasted like they were double dipped in sugar.  Also, once another 10 or so people came in, it was very hard to hear each other because the noise level skyrocketed, which is surprising with so much fabric in the room.  The servers were nice and left us alone except to check on us every so often.  I don't recall being offered a second drink when my glass was taken away."}
{"input": "One of the worst sushi places I have been to in town.  My husband and I decided to try it out based on the reviews and that was a huge mistake.  The mussels were crispy and hard like they had been cooked and then microwaved.  The fish tasted off.  It was mushy and warm.  The nigiri rice were hard little balls that you could hardly bite into and they made a nice thud when they fell onto the plate. I will never ever go back.  We couldn't finish any of it, it was disgusting.  Don't risk it. It's not worth it. There are so many better places in town."}
{"input": "Really love the atmosphere here.  It is perfect for lunch but rather pricey for dinner.  I'm actually more of a fan of the lunch fare anyway so it works for me.  They do have a rewards card so be sure to get started on one of those so you can build up points.  They also have a nice patio in the back for warm weather days.  Friendly staff too!"}
{"input": "Very nice dining experience! I loved almost every dish we ordered. Artichoke salad is the best!!! I would love to come back :) Yes, I am not just a Chinese food fan, also an Italian food lover lol"}
{"input": "Ok, so I am not a sushi lover, so I didn't have sushi. I had the tempura, and it was AWESOME. Seriously. You should go here and order it for lunch. Right. Now.\n\nThe rest of the people I was with raved about the sushi, too, so I'm guessing they loved it.\n\nThe only thing I had to complain about here? The service was kind of weird. We had a reservation (although I really don't think it was necessary) and we waited for a long time before anyone came over to take a drink order. Plus, we had to ask to get water glasses and even then the water didn't come until AFTER they brought our regular drinks out.\n\nThat was kind of strange but I will forgive them because I think I finally found a place where I can go when my husband is craving sushi."}

{"input": "Oh my gosh! This place probably had some of THE best chinses food I have ever consumed. Upon visitng Philadelphia, my boyfriend and I decided to wander around Chinatown. Based on some of the reviews on here, I suggested we try Empress Garden for a late lunch. We were glad we did! We ordered the \"Family Dinner for 2\" with Hot and Sour soup; Sweet and Sour Chicken and Veggie Lo Mein. I am not a huge fan of Hot and Sour soup but my boyfriend is and he is very picky about it, but he loved it here! Even finished my bowl as well. The sweet and sour chicken was soooo good. Best I have ever had. It came with the sauce already on it and it was still nice and crispy. The lo mein was also above par and although we were too stuffed to finish it, the waitress gladly packed it up to go and we had a little snack for back at our hotel. If I am ever in Philly again, I will definitely be back to visit this restaurant."}
{"input": "Malaysian cuisine isn't something I'm very experienced in.  Nice, clean atmosphere with good service and what's here isn't bad at all.  A little too strongly salted for my tastes, but perhaps that's just the way it is?  Way too much sodium for me, but perhaps I can ask them to go light on the salt next time.  The oyster omelet was a little too greasy as well.  Extensive menu and vegetarian friendly.  Everyone can probably find something they like here."}
{"input": "Dr Megan Harris is fabulous! She cracks me up! ;-) I've been going to see Dr Megan for 6-7 yrs now. I highly recommend her. She is hoghly knowledgeable & can recommend various other health practitioners!  The clinic is usually open on Sundays too!"}
{"input": "This bakery is amazing, from the decor to the quality of the service.  Come to the frosted fox for friendky service from thr owners and then try one of their delicious desserts.  the prices are incredibly reasonable. The biggest problem is figuring out what you want to order. I recommend the giant snicker doodle cookie or the m&m cookie. Both were amazing and you really can't go wrong!"}
{"input": "The food here was fantastic. Chicken 65 and the dosas were delicious. I hope more people come here. It isn't the fanciest of places, but it is very endearing. I hope they are successful bringing authentic Indian food to Nashville."}
{"input": "Hard to find good authentic Criollo food. This place is quaint and very homey. The owner was wonderful and very present throughout our dinner. The food was delicious and felt like I was eating at my Mom's dinner table. I will definitely visit again."}
{"input": "Not bad. Prices are very reasonable, service is friendly. This place works like a subway: you go in, pick a size and start adding ingredients which you can see. Sizes are deceiving and pack more of a punch than you'd think, based on just looking at them. That being said, a large bowl may or may not be enough for a hungry person, and the lack of additional sides or other items to quench your appetite may leave you either ordering another bowl, or seeking munchies elsewhere."}
{"input": "Stayed here for work and it was the only place in town that had availability. Check in was a breeze and my room was nice. Free tea and coffee and very clean and fresh smelling room. Lobby was large and open. Breakfast buffet is an option that I took advantage of two days ($16.95), it would be nice if breakfast could be included like other hotels in the area. Parking is expensive $38 a day, bit work is paying so no harm to me. Close to the ballpark and Washington street where all the bars and restaurants are. Walking distance to the arch. I think I'll try another hotel next time."}
{"input": "Came here for lunch with my fiancee and friend, found a small table by the window.  they have a great and varied wine selection.  I got a bubbly and my fiancee got some Italian orange soda.  We got the lamb sausage, potato chips, and crab stuffed peppers as \"snacks\" then i got the mozzarella with prosciutto bacon bits sandwich which was delicious and savory while being light and healthy. service was prompt and polite.  rustic, intimate, and cozy wine lounge atmosphere with low to medium noise level.  bathroom door lock and handle are kind of confusing to use at first. would definitely recommend for lunch!"}
{"input": "Pleasantly surprised by this joint. We were expecting tired and average food but we had excellent service, flavorful food with excellent flavors. The roasted russet potatoes were to die for - perfectly prepared with a soft inside and nice crispy skin. Most rotating restaurants spun out in the 70s but this place is still going strong!"}
{"input": "This is an awesome place to hang out with friends, shoot some pool, they have a small kitchen, and it's BYOB.  The staff is friendly, but for some reason - I guess local law - you need to be a member (no charge),  prices are good, and we've never had to wait for a table, not have we ever been rushed."}
{"input": "Great hidden gem of S. Tampa! Good selection of wine and some beer. The food is light and delicious.  Always good servic"}
{"input": "Fabuloso. This place I hit every single time I fly to Tampa.  So deliciously tasty.  \n\nThe rice pudding is to die for.  \n\nV."}
{"input": "This amazing brick oven pizza joint gets better every time I go. The last I time I went I got a Rotolo and a prosciutto pizza. The Rotolo is dough wrapped around mortadella and ricotta cheese and topped with pistachios and oil. It is so good. I order it every time. It's about the size of a bun and cost $5. The pizza was amazing. The prosciutto was incredibly tasty. The dough is divine. The service is always great and the beer selection is good. Definitely one of the best pizza places in Philly."}
{"input": "I tend to stay away from strip mall bars, that being said my buddy John is a bar back here and raved about it so we decided to give it a try. The food is very good, I will try their pizza next time, they also have a killer craft bar they just added, prices are very reasonable too"}
{"input": "Paid through Expedia and double charged by Wyndham. When I try to resolve with the hotel, I am sent to voicemail and calls are not returned. I had to call my credit card company to contest. \n\nThe bathroom was tiny and dirty. Hair from previous guest still on tub and shower. It took 20 minutes to get an elevator at one point.  People were taking the stairs from the 18th floor."}
{"input": "Do yourself a favor and order up a beef gyro platter. It comes with so much food you could probably feed two, but you're going to want to hoard it all for yourself. Plus you get enough hummus and pita to bath in -- win win."}
{"input": "this place is pretty much perfect. we go here whenever we are downtown and want to get coffee. the coffee is pretty good. they do espresso. it is verve I've read but they're starting to roast themselves. thats cool. the service and people are nice and the vibe is mellow.\n\nI landed at The French Press once, after being away from Santa Barbara for awhile. I remember sitting at one of their sunny, steel tables outside. Pretty dogs and Santa Barbarans abounded. I sat yesterday on one of their bar seats facing the all-window front, a diorama of Pleasantville spread out before me. Every bit of sunshine and view I took in was assuring me, 'everything is alright, things are good here.' And so it is. I hope The French Press keeps the vibe."}
{"input": "I can honestly say beat place I can get a good cheesesteak and the bar next to it is a bonus, could work on better staff and a better way of ordering but the please is the bomb food is beyond amazing"}
{"input": "The restaurant was nice, and the staff was very friendly. Unfortunately, the sushi wasn't very good. I had the Mexican roll, California roll, and Philly roll."}
{"input": "Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant in Delaware County! Aside from never having had a bad meal here, I can also tell you their fried calamari is the best. I order it every time."}
{"input": "I was very pleased with my visit to this barbershop. Very nice facility. Professional and pleasant atmosphere."}
{"input": "This place is VERY crowded and not in a good way - unless you enjoy smelling other people's BO while you eat and drink. Gag! I guess the smell of the patrons matches the smell of the bathrooms which are also gag worthy and dirty. \n\nThe prices aren't really great for the meh food available. Service was also meh. A few times we wondered if our server was every coming back. There are so many better options in Philly as a foodie city to try, so why waste your time and money here? Pass and head somewhere else."}
{"input": "The staff are pretty nice it has a surprisingly large seating area. Room to spread out. The place smells a bit of fabulouso floor cleaner. The food is awesome though.\n\nAmazing gyros and the onion rings came out perfectly!!\n\nThe area around this place is pretty ghetto plus right down the street from Clearwater high so if you come around the time school gets out you have the pleasure of dealing with hormonal teenagers strutting around making a ruckus. Nothing I wouldn't have done at their age though."}
{"input": "Fun place. The game room has for different groups, golf, boxing, rock n roll, etc.. Pick your game and enjoy with family & friends. Great seafood, awesome drinks, can't go wrong coming here."}
{"input": "Ate here twice in one week. In NOLA, that's an endorsement.  Our waiter, Ritchie, was memorable.  \"Christian Mingle\"..... What a line!  I will try other Besh restaurants if I have to,,,,but Luke will be hard to beat."}
{"input": "Really great food. Love that it was a great spot for a family to eat breakfast. Banana pancakes and boudin omelet we're really good."}
{"input": "Absolutely INCREDIBLE. Every time we go we leave 100% satisfied. Food is fresh, delicious, and the service is impeccable. We usually sit at the bar, great bartenders as well. \n\nWe go at least once a month. This is by far our favorite restaurant in the Philly area."}
{"input": "One of my favorite places ever, to grab a bite to eat. Small plates are the theme here.. But that does NOT mean you have to share ;) Their short rib panini's are to DIE for.. Not to mention that complimentary black truffle popcorn  Atmosphere is laid back, modern, and comfortable. Making it ideal for a lunch, dinner, or business date. \nStaff is knowledgeable, personable, friendly and professional.  \nWith a bright-innovative bar, complete with unique cocktail concoctions.. They have just about anything to accommodate the pickiest of palettes..\nThis is by far, one of my top 5's in Indy  very reasonably priced, you get a lot for what u pay for.. Esthetically pleasing, and full of flavor, check this place out, you won't regret it :)"}
{"input": "decent Pho.  Nothing really special.  I can't imagine ever going back to this place when Pho 75 is way way better and right next door...  Only plus of this place is they have  a huge menu"}
{"input": "So disappointed...pho broth was just ok and they really skimped out on the beef brisket. My husband's bahn mi pork sandwich was mostly bread again with very little meat. We've had much better bahn mi and pho in Philly/NY/NJ area and were excited to try the local Vietnamese influence. Sadly did not live up to the hype."}
{"input": "Excellent restaurant & service. Very nice atmosphere & friendly staff. I have tried the pizza & the calzone. Really nice and I loved it."}
{"input": "Hands down best Gourmet Mexican and tequila bar in town! Food is fresh and cooked to order. Chicken tacos out of this world! Carne Asada tacos are mouthwatering.  Handcrafted margaritas made with fresh lime juice and no bottled sour mix. El Jeffe is our favorite...Don Julio, lime juice, agave, and a splash of Grand Marnier. Perfect!  Enjoy live music on the patio Friday and Saturday nights. Fabulous Sunday brunch too!"}
{"input": "Ordered from here for the first time tonight. I got jalepeno poppers which were by far the best i've ever had, although they were a little pricey.\n\nI also ordered a small plain pizza, and after I finished off the poppers I opened up the pizza and realized there were mushrooms on it.  I was alright with that, to me I just got lucky with a free topping, but if it had been some kind of meat I would have been pretty bummed (I'm a vegetarian).  The pizza was really tasty, Crust was a little softer then I prefer but it was real good. I will definitely order from here again, maybe not for a little while just cause it is more expensive then other places.\n\nAlso delivery was fast, and the guy called me right when he got to my house. A big problem I have with delivery places is when they call before they actually get to your house, cause I live pretty far out in the ghetto and I don't like standing around outside after they call... but these guys were right out front when they called me."}
{"input": "I didn't really read the reviews of this place before coming in, so I didn't even notice that this was a foundation for at-risk youth to learn culinary skills and hospitality. The place was clean and quaint and decorated well with such great service and courteousness from everyone at the establishment.\nPrices were standard for a restaurant of this caliber. we ordered gumbo, fried catfish, baked chicken and roasted salmon. mac and cheese was great and so was the sweet potato mash and collard greens. Service was phenomenal. everything tasted great, and we were happy to support this initiative."}
{"input": "I went here when if first opened, and have never desired to go back again, I was so very disappointed at the quality and the taste of the food. I would absolutely not recommend dining here."}
{"input": "Loved this place, especially the Salmon. Only eaten here at Lunch and not a problem. Going to add this one to my Lunch rotation.\nSpotless restrooms and the service is top notch."}
{"input": "Fantastic little BYOB! The Antipasto Salad and Gnocchi were excellent. Contrary to some other reviews about the crowded seating, I thought it was rather spacious. There are other BYOB's in Philadelphia that are much smaller. I will be back here again soon."}
{"input": "There's a two drink or food minimum. If you have specific seat requests, let the hostess know in advance. Also, if you purchase their t-shirt and wear, you receive some free stuff."}
{"input": "Don't bother going.  The servers are too busy dancing to take your order.  Waited  30 minutes and never had our order taken.    But the servers danced two songs."}
{"input": "Arcadia Landscape is a great locally owned company. I would recommend this company to family, friends, and any local business owners. Their work is high quality, and they stand behind their product."}
{"input": "Walked in and sat at the sushi bar. I told the chefs my budget and what kind of fish I liked. They created 2 of the most delicious rolls I've ever had and I think they had fun doing it. \"Colorful roll\" and a version of their \"Big Yami\" pictured below."}
{"input": "I went to spa nails before and that place was terrible. I came here and had a much better experience. The nail technician listened to what I wanted and made sure that I was happy when I left. I got gold foil because I couldn't find a salon that did gold foil! \n\nMy cuticles were amazing after and the gel lasted 3-4 weeks. Definitely will be coming back when I need another manicure in Reno."}
{"input": "Cindy is the best! Great food and service. Food is authentic and so is the staff. Everything is made fresh and you can taste the difference from other Mexican restaurants at first bite. I would recommend to anyone that enjoys Mexican cuisine."}
{"input": "Recently had my car tinted by Orange Tint and Tune and had fantastic service.  They offer a car pick up service if you live within 4 miles of their shop which is extremely convenient.  Carlos was my technician and went over all the tint options with me and even adjusted the grade of the tint after I expressed the look that I was trying to achieve.  That's the kind of customer care that deserves 5 stars.  In addition, the receptionist was very pleasant and the owner Dustin even followed up to see how my service was."}
{"input": "High pressure tea sales!  Good teas but outrageously expensive.  Try Republic of Tea or even good old Twinings."}
{"input": "Very cute place and good food. Pear cider beer was really good the service was really good and great ambiance and the price was very reasonable"}
{"input": "Jones' has a great, low-key vibe albeit office-style arm chairs that are impossible to move.  The menu has a list of comfort foods that sound great, even though you feel like you should be able to make them at home (e.g., grilled cheese and mac 'n cheese). \n\nI had the calamari salad which had a nice smoky chipotle dressing over fresh greens and sweet corn--the only disappointing part was the I was eating cold fried calamari mixed in.  If the calamari had been grilled and more tender, I think this could have been a really great entree.  The drink list has some fun options, with the Bubbly Breeze being a light and enjoyable thirst-quencher."}
{"input": "Buyer beware, besides being an awesome \"dive\" bar, this is a steelers bar. I believe the owner is a Pittsburgh native hence the pittsburgese style sandwiches (overstuffed with lots of coleslaw and French fries). \n\nI went here a few Sunday's ago to watch football and cure a hangover and I'll have to agree with other yelpers- the food was fried goodness that had my stomach doing flips for a few hours. I thought the staff was super friendly- despite my hatred for the black and gold. The prices were on par with the food/service, I can't wait to try it again!"}
{"input": "Coffee Syrup (think Maple syrup) over ice cream! \nYou'll ALWAYS find unique food items here! \nFabulous Friendly Helpful staff especially Suzanna! \nTried & True Favorites of mine, \nOrange (glazed) Chicken and Sweet petite peas \nThey are known for Always being in the Top 5-10 Cheap Fine Wines!! \nA friend of mine, her parents are from a DRY County in TN (WTH is That) & they Always stock up on Wine when in town!!\nTheir cereals in a box are some of the most delectable ever!"}
{"input": "Today after our Ethiopian food fiasco (see Selam review), we literally RAN into Pi after waiting hours to be served at the prior restaurant. We must have looked like a pack of hungry wolves so we told the hostess what had just happened. She seated us right away and sent us two orders of garlic bread (which we later found out were comped!). \n\nWe ordered two pizzas and scarfed it all down. Pi has been consistently good on every visit I have made since I've moved to STL. Service is always excellent. Both the deep dish and thin crust are amazing every time."}
{"input": "Good and fast service....meat is always very juice ....BBQ sauce is great...prices are reasonable...if you this truck around stop and try you won't be disappointed"}
{"input": "Can't speak about the food, since we never made it that far. We were seated (near the restrooms/kitchen), while a twosome that entered behind us were seated near the window and allowed to watch the comings and goings along Frenchmen Street. Was told the server would be with us soon. Server walks out from the kitchen and immediately goes to the twosome that came in after us. We were already forgotten before we had a chance to crack open the menus. Added to that, there was a dead cockroach on our table. Food didn't look spectacular enough to make us stay; that, and the dead cockroach was the ultimate deal-killer. Staff should spend more time cleaning up the joint instead of cleaning those fancy fedoras."}
{"input": "Went to this event on Monday morning. Parking was fine and it's not as packed as I expected. The ribs a good, but a little bit pricey. The best way I would recommend is go with a group of friends and share the ribs from different vendors."}
{"input": "Great atmosphere, service was very friendly and prices were very reasonable however I found the food a bit bland, not bad just bland. My husband and I were starving after a long drive to Philly and this filled the spot but it wasn't overly enjoyable and we most likely won't be back."}

{"input": "Visiting Philadelphia from Chicago, and came into this store to purchase souvenirs for family. We found more than we even expected! We purchase so many items because the prices were great. We found souvenirs and even more! The owner was amazing and helped us pick out some of our gifts to take back home! We spent and hour there shopping and talking with the owner and didn't want to leave! Thank you for such a great experience in south Philly! -Nicole and Michelle"}

{"input": "There are few Restaurants that deserve 5 stars, and fewer that are close to me.\nThis one has only recently opened. Because I have eaten at Nabin's other Restaurants and have found his Chef skills to be superior, I anxiously awaited the Grand Opening.\nI recently attended Lunch Buffet with family. One member from New York stated, \"This is THE BEST Indian food I have ever had. And I have been to the best of them in New York\".\nOn this day, the food was better than ever. I was told they hired an additional cook.\nI had my Saag made without cream - the yummiest!\nAnd the Chai was exceptional.\nThere are more decorations. It is quite a beautiful place to be proud to take a group to eat.\nA big bronze Dakini greats you (I think it's a Dakini - a divine being of nature)\nI always love the Yellow Dal, Kulcha Bread, their fragrant Rice and so much more.\nEveryone is friendly and inviting.\nService is stellar - felt like a Queen with many waitstaff stopping by.\nThank you Nirvana - so aptly named!"}
{"input": "I stopped in because I was hungry for some snacks.  Browsed the store since I had some spare time and found it to be clean and well stocked.  Wide isles, good selection of bakery stuff, flowers and all your usual groceries. I like that they had some locally made snacks too like California Kettle Corn and Taco Works (out of SLO).  Found the semi-unusual chips I wanted that other stores don't always carry, grabbed a Diet Coke by the checkout and I was happy.  Convenient parking lot and the staff was friendly and helpful.  Thanks Albertsons!"}
{"input": "Staff is so friendly and courteous. Made me feel wonderful about paying so much for donuts."}
{"input": "Very poor service, very greasy pizza. The pizza I ordered didn't even have the same toppings as described in the menu.  The table was never wiped, the food sat for several minutes in view before it was delivered.  The table next to us had dirty dishes on it almost the whole time.  I think everything else in the Indianapolis airport is better."}
{"input": "I last went here during Rib Fest (Labor Day weekend) this year. It's the Peppermill, you think gaudy bright colors that affect your eyesight in ways you can't imagine. Yet, they are remodeling it. I fear in a few years, it'll look just like the Bellagio in Las Vegas. So good bye carpet with planetary shapes.. Farewell, I will miss you.\n\nThe rooms were clean, and the typical clientele were tons older than my age group. Why did I want to treat this place like I was in Las Vegas? It's not, so minus one star because you are in Reno, not Las Vegas, sorry peppermill."}
{"input": "The service here has gone down. We used to go here a lot but now we go to another one. The service was slow and forgotten about."}
{"input": "Be prepared to wait if you come here. We were given a 40min wait on a saturday night. But walking around 12 south was always pleasant so I didnt mind that. Also they use an app that shows you in real time how much waiting time you have left and how many people before you in the line. Cool, huh?\n\nFood - tasty burgers and even tastier fries!!! We ended up ordering 2 extra portions of fries for takeout after our meal and munched on those during our House of Cards binging session later that day. So worth it!"}
{"input": "I have enjoyed this spot for several years and it has always been 5 star. The staff is always friendly and the sushi always fresh. It is small and quaint,  a nice get away."}
{"input": "This place rules.  Seriously.  Awesome clothing, clean, very nice and helpful staff.  My only complaint is that the pricing is really inconsistent which is why it got four stars instead of five."}
{"input": "We stayed here on a spur of the moment weekend getaway. The hotel was conveniently located near the mall and historical Valley Forge both of which we visited. \nThe hotel it's self was fairly new and modern. We arrived an hour before check in time but our room was ready so we were able to check in a little early! Our room it's self was pretty spacious for a hotel room. Everything in the room was clean, and I'm picky about that! The only small complaint about the room was it had a musty smell when we first walked in but after running the air conditioner for a little bit it was gone.\nOne of the main reasons we chose Hyatt Place was the indoor pool for our son to swim in. The pool area was very clean, again I'm picky about clean! I liked that the pool and hot tub where right next to each other. We could be in the hot tub while watching our son in the pool. I never got in the pool but my husband and son did say it could of been a little warmer!"}
{"input": "Awesome shop. Everyone is really nice an freely offers suggestions on areas to hit that have been very productive ! The bait is always TOP Notch too. Great supply of tackle an honestly some of the best prices I've seen. I used to buy a lot\nOf my tackle at Walmart ( yes I've regretted that ) or dicks. After learning the error of my ways, an seeing the really great prices I've been buying all of my tackle from this shop. You can't go wrong with this bait shop ! The only issue I have is there isn't more of them around town !!!"}
{"input": "I order pizza and chicken cheesesteaks from here on a regular basis. Their Sicilian is awesome! Also great is that you can buy some bear when you drop by."}
{"input": "Went here a few weeks ago for contacts. I had previously gotten an eye exam at another place but they were way too expensive when it came to ordering contacts. Saw this place while shopping at the plaza and decided to check it out. I was greeted right away by the receptionist. I was helped by an associate named Paige who made the transition of my records very smooth without hassle. I was looking to try out new colored contacts and Paige was very patient with me as I tried nearly all the colors they had to offer!  Despite me trying all of the different colors, the associate worked efficiently that the whole appointment lasted less than 30 minutes.  Also, they told me it would take 3-5 business days for my contacts to come in and it came in 2! Will definitely come back for my next contact order."}
{"input": "They have a surprisingly good ahi poke here made fresh every morning. And if you want them to make a spicy ahi just call in the morning so they can make a spicy batch of tuna. \n\nThey also have a great organic fruit and vegetable selection that'll keep me coming back here. Their staff is super friendly and always willing to help. \n\nThey even have that cool amazon locker grocery system here. I'm way too indecisive to order my groceries online, but it's a good think to keep in mind when wanting to shop here.  I can see it coming in handy if you just need to grab groceries on a jiffy. Just pay in advanced and type in your locker code. \n\nTheir prices are very reasonable here for their quality of goods. I would definitely recommend this grocery store."}
{"input": "The chick that works here is seriously retarded. Spacey as fck, dosent pay attention, and can't take an order. \n\nIts IV, so can't expect much. \n\nThe pho was a little funky... wanst a huge fan of the broth, but it had a lot of veggies and tofu in it, so i was fairly satisfied. \n\nIced coffee was good. \n\nmeh."}
{"input": "There were five of us,we were planing a Bridal shower. Our waitress was Taiya she was amazing,I think she had just as much fun with us as we did with her.  My daughter and I both had a full rack of Ribs so  juicy and covered with barbecue sauce,coleslaw and fries. Had the Fallen Cherry Stout loved it,the brewmaster Doug is the best. Can't forget the bartender Kelsey love her very friendly."}
{"input": "CRAB RAGOONS! Need I say more? \n\nThe highlight was the crab ragoons. These were the best of my life. They have a  large variety of Asian cuisine here. Everyone can find something they like on their menu. Also, I wanted to share that they have on stock my favorite beer from when I lived in China: Tsingtao!"}
{"input": "I seek out brick oven pizza places as craft pizza is one of my favorite dining options. I sat at the bar and the bartender gave us great service all evening. \n\nWe had the 3 cheese and pita appetizer. The jalapeño & pimento cheese is fantastic. The grand finale was the Mexican pizza. Black bean spread, jalapeño, chicken ... All topped with sour cream. This is possibly the best pizza I have ever eaten.\n\nBrixx is a must if you are a pizza lover"}
{"input": "So much hype the cheese steak was soso. The neighborhood is scary I saw two drug deals go down outside so don't come here at night. The establishment was cool strait out of the 1960's  felt like I was in a Rocky 1 movie. It's a cool place to people watch."}
{"input": "One of the best burgers in Philly!\n\nLow key joint with just a few tables and the kitchen in the dining room. But, don't let the modest face fool you, this place rocks!\n\nMenu is creative and fully customizable. Burgers are cooked on a flattop, perfectly seared, juicy, slightly charred. Fries are hand cut, fried fresh, perfectly crispy and salty. What more could you ask for from a burger place? \n\nPro tip - Download the SPOT app for a rewards program and some good coupons (aka free fries!)."}

{"input": "Seven of us came to celebrate a family event-our waiter Rene was the best-sharp, witty and made us feel like family.  Unfortunately, the food did not-two people ordered the seafood bouillabaisse and both said it was tasteless.  Fish that was served was just ok-we thought we had walked into the movie set of Ratatouille before the young chef had been allowed to cook.  The dessert was frozen solid so it had to be returned.  The food was disappointing but Rene was a showman who did his best."}
{"input": "I went there with my friend, she just came from Arizona. I wanted to find a place can see the night view in Philly. The place is good, but the waitress was not good. The service is bad. And food was not that good, tasting just like TGfriday.  But we spent almost $200. I will not go there again."}
{"input": "I've only had the sushi and it was pretty good. I want to try the Chinese food, and will update once I do."}
{"input": "The food lacked flavor, but everything else was great. The presentation is near perfect and the location/decor are spot on."}
{"input": "Enjoyed my fish out at a sidewalk table.  A bit pricey but food was good.  Go to Side street in French quarter if u want quieter dining outside."}
{"input": "Went for our valentines dinner tonight and the staff and manager went out of their way to make this night so special. Highly recommend this location!"}
{"input": "5 stars for the food!  We had the veggie appetizer which was great, and then we each had a pasta dish that we shared. Beet and goat cheese plin, pheasant lasagnette, mushroom ravioli and the tagliatelle with rabbit ragu. Superb (luckily we didn't mind sharing!). Also had sides of the cauliflower rissoto which was delicious and the baked artichokes which was okay.  Bombilinis for dessert was a perfect ending. The wait staff was attentive, although our particular waitress seemed a bit distracted. Am definitely going again to try the pizza next time."}
{"input": "Don't eat here unless you like hash, otherwise the options are really limited. I got the egg white frittata which was super average. Their vanilla bean latte was very good."}
{"input": "Went there this morning for brunch. The waiter was not friendly at all. Had to keep asking for coffee refills...and creamer...and sugar. We were a party of 6 & all 6 of us were drinking coffee. How do you not bring more creamer & sugar? He seemed annoyed that i asked him to repeat the special. He never smiled or even looked at us. The portions were large. Overpriced. I had the burger. It was nothing great. Bisque was good. My son had the crabmeat omlette which he didn't like. My other son had the croquet madam which he liked. We will most likely not go back."}
{"input": "Great HOT pizza...even at 2 AM in Broad Ripple.  The only thing I used to get here were the breadstix with cheese and ranch.  Definitely glad I can now add pizza to the repertoire."}
{"input": "This place is fantastic!  Delicious, simple, healthy. Literally could not ask for anything more, especially at under $10! Beef is my favorite but I could also go for the chicken. If you haven't been here and you are still reading this review, stop what you are doing and go right now."}
{"input": "This is simply great Japanese restaurant. Great foods and service. It is surprisingly clean and spotless. I had one of the best Ramen here. I definitely will come back next time I visit Philadelphia."}
{"input": "Amazing hotel; I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Reno.  We had a two queen room in the Peppermill Tower. Very spacious, comfortable and nicely decorated. Casino is very bright; lots of gaming areas to choose from, great selection of restaurants.  The screens around the casino showing places around the world is mesmerizing and a nice touch. The sports book area is the best I've seen anywhere!!"}
{"input": "I'm pretty impressed with this place. Healthy lunch, large enough to save some for dinner. Not too expensive. Actual parking spaces. What's not to like?"}
{"input": "Perfect place to take visitors. The plates are small and pricey but flavorful. Drinks are pretty much $10 across the board. The live music/atmosphere make the outing worth the cost. Make reservations if possible!\nFun Fact: My husband and I met Bill Murray and Jon Favreau here."}
{"input": "We have been going here for food and beer for a while, but will no longer bring our business to Pasqually's.  The owners allow a loud group of day workers to take over their joint several days a week to the point of fighting and breaking beer bottles.  Since complaining to the owners has brought no change, we will go elsewhere."}
{"input": "The cheese sticks were some of the best I've ever had. Deep dish sausage and pepperoni was pretty good. The wait however was horrid! We waited almost 2 hours! We were told the pizza takes 35-45 minutes to cook and then after asking when it would be ready an hour and a half later were told well it takes over an hour. Then our deep dish supreme was burnt and left a horrible after taste. The manager offered to make something new...didn't have another 2 hours. She did remove the burnt pizza from the ticket but that's it. We never even got our box for our leftovers that were worth taking home. Oh well. I do not recommend this place"}
{"input": "Had dinner here on our first night in St Louis.\n\nShared the toasted ravioli as an appetizer. Good stuff.\n\nThe main course was a medium rare porterhouse steak for me and the rack of lamb for the little lady. Sides were four cheese potato Au gratin and a baked potato, plus the house salad. Good stuff.\n\nFinished it off with an Italian custard with fresh fruit and a rum raisin ice cream. And a cappuccino. All good.\n\nThe service was very friendly and attentive. Maybe too attentive. As we fished one course, they immediately brought out the next. Fast service is normally great, but come on, gives us a little time to digest between courses."}
{"input": "This place has good food. However, the customer service is terrible. I arrived at around 7:30 pm on a Thursday and I wanted to order a take out appetizer or meal. First, I asked them what was the meal of the day. A waitress told me that they don't have any left. Ok that was understandable. Then I asked the same waitress if I can order meat pies (arayes). She said that this will take 40 minutes to make it ready. She pointed to a group of people sitting of about 25 persons and implied that they were busy making food for them. Afterwards, I asked her what about just a regular appetizer like hummus and baba gannoush. She again said that they need 40 minutes to prepare it! Also she pointed at the same group of people with her finger. \nAt that point I just left the restaurant. \nIt is horrendous that they needed 40 minutes to prepare hummus!! It is very obvious that they were overwhelmed and didn't want to waste their time on a small order. Very unprofessional and very unwelcoming! Very bad service!"}
{"input": "fast service and superb skills. this is by far the best locksmith I've used in ages!"}
{"input": "I went here 5-7 years ago.  I remember it being very remote and a flashback to the 1800's.\nThe food was different - woodsy - gamey but good.  They served venison, duck, rabbit, sweetbreads, etc.  \nThe ambiance was cool.  It was like entering someone's house - in the 1800's.  \nI want to go back."}
{"input": "Our server, Julliette, was very very nice to the children and draws a very good ketchup blowfish."}
{"input": "The food and service were sooo disappointing I felt compelled to join Yelp and write this review.  The food was exceedingly bland and flavorless.   I had the beef sate with chinese broccholi  which was advertised as spicy.  Not only wasn't it spicy but the sauce had no flavor at all let alone spice or sate.  The spring roll was doughy with limp(not crisp) veggies and bland.  The duck abalone soup was the only part of the meal that had some slight flavor. My companions had the duck with vegetables over rice which looked very dry, and the vegetables had a burned oily flavor.  Another had the pork over  rice which was salty but otherwise underseasoned as well.   We waited about 15-20 minutes before our order was taken,  and the wait for the check was long as well.  The appetizers and entrees all arrived at the same time.  I've had better Chinese food from food carts.  My least satisfying meal in Chinatown, and I eat out alot all over the country."}
{"input": "This place catches your eye. Decent selection of food that is fun to put together. When I try it again, I'll write something more substantive."}
{"input": "The BBQ shrimp is amazing.  Be prepared to get a little messy if you order it.  They have the head on and need to be peeled, but it is well worth the trouble.  The shrimp are huge too."}
{"input": "Disclaimer: I'm a vegetarian that dines with carnivores.\n\nFood: c\nService: d\n\nHeard a lot about the veg burg and love to go to places with good food and a veg option.  Had the house veg burger w/pretzel bun and tots.  Everything was delish except the veg patty.  It was basically the innards of a Taco Bell bean burrito.  No bueno.  Slap a beef patty on there and I'm sure the rating will improve.  Service was inadequate except for the bar staff.  Got a beer waiting for the table and he acknowledged and served us quick.  Hostess was overwhelmed and empty tables went unfilled.  Our waitress was also overwhelmed and returns to the table for refills and checks were few and far between.  \n\nI appreciate the veg addition to the menu but put 5 minutes more thought into it and add some staff and I'll try again"}
{"input": "I live right by here and I would drive across town for a gyro before eating here. \n\nWhy do you think there is a half price Groupon for Momo's everyday? \n\nThis used to be a fairly wild bar from what I've heard. \n\nNow it is a mediocre Mediterranean restaurant with obnoxious belly dancers and tacky girls from St. Charles who mistakenly think they're in downtown Clayton."}
{"input": "My first time at this tiny jewel of a spa, inside of the charming Monteleone. Lance worked some magic to get our party of four accommodated in less than 48 hours on a holiday weekend. \n\nMy full pedicure was expertly and lavishly administered by Millie. I'm no stranger to pedicures, but this was several levels above the usual fare! \n\nAlso, I received a one hour massage at the magic hands  of Trudy, during which my soul left my body at least twice. Trudy's skills are beyond relaxing and highly beneficial; I felt ready to take on the hot NOLA afternoon with renewed vigor. \n\nThank you to all. HIGHLY recommend."}
{"input": "This place is horrible . Terrible customer service and very slow . Drinks were overflowing on the table as well"}
{"input": "Courtney Bradberry was friendly, professional, and gave a mean haircut. The salon itself is beautiful and actually reasonably priced for what it is. Will be returning soon.!"}
{"input": "We really enjoyed this restaurant!  We started with hummus and feta cheese mixed with roasted red peppers, super tasty!  We also had their Philly cheesesteak sandwich and a BLT and Brie, both sandwiches were amazing!  The BLT had thick perfectly cooked bacon.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is its a little pricey."}
{"input": "Very friendly, prompt, and attentive service. So far I've only tried the tofu bahn mi & the spicy tofu. Both are excellent, but splurge on the spicy if you like spicy things, the sauce is excellent! This is my go-to Vietnamese place in the LGD."}
{"input": "This place is great, they work on other people's work which is convenient if you already have a set. My tech was Divina, and she did a wonderful job with my touch up in a very quick manner. Would recommended to anyone in the Tucson area, and their prices are competitive as well. With lashes you get what you pay for, and that is defiantly the case here. Also for reference they use Bella lashes, which are one of the best on the market."}
{"input": "I enjoyed the small, family vibe of this healthy brunch spot. Located off the beaten path in New Orleans lower Garden District, Surrey's offers a lot of cleaner alternatives to the biscuits and gravy you'll find slopping up other breakfast menus in the area. When you want a fresh squeezed juice and a veggie-friendly bite, this place is a good bet. We got the creole baked eggs and Migas with chorizo. Both were a hearty portion served alongside corn tortillas as a gluten-free alternative! The wait time for a table was long, but the service was friendly! I'd recommend to my friends who prefer lighter fare in a clean, local-centric environment."}
{"input": "I just had the best pedicure with Gina. She made sure to get all of the rough spots and my heels have never been so smooth. It was worth every penny. Definitely going back."}
{"input": "My husband and I practically live here, and have through the past 8 years or so.  They have great food, prepared fast, great drink specials."}
{"input": "If I were a beer drinker, this place would get one more star. However, judging on food alone, it was a-ok. The portabella mushroom sandwich was juicy, but it really bothered me that I could smell the fermented wheat from the brewery attached. The smell was very strong, and overwhelming. \n\nHowever, it was fun to see the brewery in action. An additional plus is the weekend farmers market that is set up on their parking lot, but their produce is a bit high for a farmers market."}
{"input": "The ice cream is amazing and very inexpensive. They have a drive thru for convenience and they have a wonderful staff!  Delicious!"}
{"input": "Perfect New Orleans experience! Live music, great food and drinks!\n\nThere are refrigerators with cheeses, beer, water, and white wines. Reds as well as some whites/champagnes are displayed around the room. Plan on getting their early to secure a table and chairs. Next to the register there are buckets for ice to keep drinks cool. \n\nWe were looking to try something new and the staff is well versed in their inventory and gave us great advice.Great \"pick your own\" cheese plate, served with delicious toast points. Be sure to bring some cash if you plan on ordering from the chef cooking outback. You can visit their website and see the calendar of rotating chefs and musicians."}
{"input": "Love this place. My nails always are beautifully done and the prices are great. Also like that I can walk in and not call. My nail technician was also very communicative about what I wanted, very friendly and made me feel comfortable. Will definitely be back."}
{"input": "Soup was fresh spicy and delicious! Wish it was closer to our house because I would eat there all the time!"}
{"input": "Me and my wife and our friends went to The Pines Tavern. The food is really good there. We were going to a show at BRT so we look up a bar in Bristol Pa. That how we found this place . It like a corner Bar it's small but nice. This was two weeks ago but I had put it up on Yelp because food was really good and I would go back again. My friend Pat had steak smash potatoes and vegetables said it was good. My wife had a burger and fries and I had shrimp with chicken with mixed vegetables and Francine had crab cakes. And we ordered on side chicken egg rolls the where really good too."}
{"input": "This place is amazing! The pizza cookies are a must. It came hot, soft, and crazy delicious. \n\nWe tried the Peanut butter pizza cookie and the Oreo cookies, and both were perfection. I'm very eager to try other flavors. Also, being open until 3am is the smartest decision of any bakery in America. \n\nThe only reason I'm not giving a 5 is because of the prices. But, to be honest, those late nights when all I want is a fresh baked cookie pizza, I'd be willing to pay $50."}
{"input": "Number 1 go to bar I  Tampa, beat drink specials by far!! Pool tables, darts, beer pong, bags. You name it the Retreat has it!"}

{"input": "We mosied over here after a trip to the Broad Ripple Farmers Market on a Saturday afternoon. I'm not typically a fan of traditional Mexican food but it just sounded really good at the time, and I was looking forward to a hearty breakfast.\n\nI ordered the breakfast quesadilla, which was fantastic. It was stuffed with eggs, potatoes, peppers, and tons of flavor! It all came with a side of rice and refried beans. Everything that came out of the kitchen looked awesome.\n\nNot to mention, it was very affordable for the generous portions. I will definitely be back to try lunch sometime soon!"}

The grounds are gorgeous.  \n\nmy husband and i got married in the mural room on the 2nd floor.  it is just spectacular.  the hallways all have tile floors and colorful Mexican-inspired tiles on the walls.  It is amazing.  So much detail is put into every nook and cranny.\n\nVisit the Courthouse and hang out....it is worth a special trip!"}

{"input": "I've always enjoyed this spot as a bar, but haven't had many meals here.\n\nI took a client to lunch there yesterday. We arrived at peak lunch time, 12:30, and the restaurant was pretty slow. This worked fine for us. We were seated right away and had a perfectly attentive waitress. Service was awesome for a working lunch. We never went without but there weren't a ton of interruptions.\n\nI got one of their specials, the bacon turkey burger and fries. The burger was good sized for a lunch portion. After eating it, I was full but not stuffed. The burger itself was well seasoned. The turkey was light but hearty enough. The bacon was mostly good but part of it was not as crispy as I like it. It comes with all the fixings. I got fries as my side. They were perfectly cooked. Very crispy outside but not burnt. They were salty with a lot of flavor. I just wish there was a little more of them. \n\nIt was a great lunch all around."}
{"input": "Got to stay here for the memorial day weekend and I can't complain, great place, clean, family oriented and has a pool.

{"input": "With winter weather in full effect, a good cup of tea really soothes the body and mind.  I'm usually a coffee guy but every once in a while you go to work feeling sick, but not deathly ill so you know you should still go to work, go here.  Their potent brews will dull the searing pain in your throat and keep the snot at bay.  Their wide selection of teas and tea-related beverages can make your head spin so ask the pros behind the counter, or you can just reference the clever names for guidance.  Free wifi and a healthy selection of books; typically very quiet as well."}

{"input": "Good coffee, super cute location, and some of the best service anywhere. I haven't eaten there yet, but I'm sure I will be back to try the food in the next few days. The barista Kayla (I don't know if the spelling is correct) was super friendly, and she took a bunch of time to recommend other places in the area."}
{"input": "C'mon people.....what are ya'll talking about \"poorly designed\" BS..?\nThis place is a great facility, located in the heart of downtown, you can actually walk there from anywhere downtown, including about 20,000 hotel rooms! Acoustics are great, the place is very well maintained, clean, friendly staff, run by the same folks who run the dome, and lets give it major thumbs up for beng called NEW ORLEANS ARENA, and not having some lame assed name like the \"national car rental center\"or \"american airlines arena\" or \"amway center\"!!!!!!!!"}
{"input": "Grilled peppered prawn appetizer - 5 stars\nStuffed pork chop over risotto - 4 stars \nMahi Mahi grilled - 4 stars\nService - 4 stars\n\nVery place with a great lively atmosphere. We came here on a Thursday night at 8pm without reservations and they were nice enough to seat us quickly. Service overall is very good and the servers seem to enjoy working here which really shows in their performance.\n\nSome of their entrees are a little over priced for their type, but you get enough food for two entrees. I would recommend dropping the size of the larger entrees (14oz pork chop is just too much) by 30% and take $7 off the price. This would be much easier to swallow."}
{"input": "Bomb food, especially for the price. The owners and workers are super nice. Overall great place, definitely check it out."}
{"input": "Wholes food have a good variety of organic food. They always seem to be up to date as well.

{"input": "I have been here a bunch of times.. It's always clean,service is quick and the food is fresh.  This is the only subway I like to go to for these reasons"}
{"input": "Delicious!!! This place has amazing food! I love everything on the menu but my favorite thing I enjoy eating here are the barbacoa tacos! So scrumptious! Also love the homemade hot sauces too! Their white sangria is also tasty and goes perfectly with your food! Can't wait to come back"}
{"input": "The absolute worst! Sat for 20 min's at the counter waiting for a tuna sandwich. Staff isn't friendly, place is old and dirty. It's insane how good this location could do if they got their act together. HORRIBLE.\n\nI miss Billy G's."}
{"input": "I went to Rene for an updo for a wedding. I've had a few bad experiences with updos so I was hesitant to get another one...\n\nRene listened to everything I said (which was a lot) and she delivered. The updo was amazing and all she used was hairspray, a few pins, and her expertise! I absolutely loved my hair and she even gave me a bang trim! \n\nThe prices are great here (I live in Chicago, so I may be biased), but I would not hesitate to come back here again and have Rene do my hair. I wish she could do my hair every day!"}
{"input": "We've had mostly great experiences in the past here, but we went again recently and were pretty disappointed.  The waitress was aloof, slow, and not friendly at all.  When we looked at our menus, we realized they had significantly raised their prices since the last time (probably by 20-25% on the entrees).  We were unadventurous and both order the salmon with mustard butter sauce, which we've both really enjoyed in the past.  Unfortunately, my salmon was a little undercooked and my wife remarked that the salmon quality was not as good as before.  The sauce was definitely off as well--overly salty and not much of the good ground mustard flavor (I think they just went heavy on the salted butter).  The food was disappointing, especially since we were paying 20-25% more than the time before."}
{"input": "According to my experience, there is just one place in Tokyo at the fish market where you get your seafood a little fresher. Here in Santa Barbara, it does not get any fresher. Right from the fish tank in the cooking pot on your plate. Don't expect a fancy restaurant with a nice ambiance because this is not the reason you come here (though the outside seating has a nice ocean/harbor view). It is the variety of fresh shellfish prepared according to your appetite and taste buds. The wait can be long during peak hours but it is worth it. Put your name down and take a walk on the peer to free-up some extra room in your stomach - you'll need it!"}
{"input": "Always dead on with fresh made foods. Folks are friendly, food is great, Italian Specialties are always tasty. Great rolls too. The comment from OTTIS B. is not true; maybe it was him, as he said \"after paying\" he went back. Owners aim to please....."}
{"input": "Cozy and family friendly restaurant. I came here for a private engagement party, where the bride and groom to be had arranged for special menus and baked all of their desserts. There were a few booth tables reserved for presents, wine, and desserts. No room for side tables like in an actual special events space.\n\nThe wait staff was nice. From the limited menu, I picked the Penne Fellini, which has prosciutto di parma, peas, onions, and light cream sauce. The whole dish was literally this pasta swimming in sauce. It may have had a light cream flavor, but it was ladled heavily onto the pasta. I didn't have a desire to consume an entire meal of this, so I ended up not finishing.\n\nIt was a fun celebration, and we were really there for the friends and family, not the food. Oh, and we also had the bruschetta and salad, neither of which was very memorable. I wouldn't be thrilled to come back here, but I think it's awesome that they turned the whole restaurant into a venue for such a special occasion!"}
{"input": "All I have to say is NANCY! She is the best waitress I've ever had. My friend and I love Cracker Barrel and it is always such a treat to go in and see Nancy's welcoming smile! She is attentive, funny and excellent at making great food suggestions. Go there and great service and great food!!"}
{"input": "I really like Franzone's. The owner is typically around, super friendly, and seems to really care about the product. While I'm not a big fan of sweet sauce, they also do a decent cheesesteak, fries, etc. Honestly, they may have been closer to a 4 if not that it's always just a really pleasant experience going in, which boosts their rating for me."}
{"input": "***YES***YES***YES***I***LOVE***LOVE***LOVE***\n\nOh yes,\nthe scorpion bowl, the piña colada (as I never drunk it before), fried shrimp taco and the Jell-O-Shots/gummy tiki cocktails ( which is an ounce of distilled spirit or any cocktail converted into a gummy bear) we had the pineapple and rum one. :-) :-) :-) all orders were delicious !!!\n........ All served by a very friendly bar mixer!\n\nThe interior is fun and has its own interpretation of a Tiki bar, my two girl-friends and me had a fantastic evening.\nthere is no more to say then: \n\nYES YES YES I LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!\n\nPerfect for a group of friends or a romantic date. Everything is right!!! Don't miss it if you are living in New Orleans or visiting. \n\nThe French Quarter Tiki bar is small enough to keep an intimate ambience, and big enough to party with your friends. \nBeautiful-Non-Commercial!!!\nTiki Tolteca would become one of my regular hangout, if I were a New Orleaner :-)\n\nEnjoy!!! :-)"}
{"input": "This used to be my go-to spot for mani and pedis, mostly because it was very close to my home. I moved to port Richmond about 6 years ago and about a year ago this place was taken Over by \"new management\" and completely changed and at all for the better. \n\nWhen they first switched over the new owner would offer you champagne or wine and made promises of what else was to come. For example They offered your own tools to you if you were a frequent client , and punch cards for rewards. However , I watched the quality of this place go right down the drain. The service became slow and less accommodating. There's no way I could get out of there in under an hour mostly due to the inexpirienced techs who I felt were winging it. I started getting the worst work and have since moved on. Stay out of there locals , there's way better shops out there!"}
{"input": "We had an excellent lunch here. The food was great and the service was fantastic. Great Gumbo Ya Ya, great BBQ shrimp, delicious crab cakes. Everything we tried was good. I highly recommend this place."}
{"input": "So located in a strip mall, so nothing exciting there...  The interior is better than the normal nail place, they have a decent decor with a lot of nail techs and they also do massages and waxing.  I was recommended to try Lee and she was friendly and offered me a beverage as soon as I arrive.  She did a nice job on my manicure which was $12.  Everything is very reasonably priced and I would return."}
{"input": "I'm home writing this review because the pool at the Y is closed, contradicting its schedule. This happens not infrequently, and is important because there are hardly any daytime lap swim hours, so that the lanes are jammed with 3 or 4 people trying to circle swim in each lane at the same time. Classes often intrude on lap swim time as well. Rec swim (kids' times) is also exasperating - you must stay with kids under age 7 in a small and confined area of the pool at all times and cannot lap swim. Every time we go we discover new rules from the lifeguard about this or that thing they can't do. Front desk staff is nice, at least. I've been a member for over a year and wish I could quit, but there aren't better options anywhere else nearby."}
{"input": "I truly enjoyed this spot. I hate chain restaurants, especially for breakfast! I am a pancake girl and this place hit the spot. The type of flour utilized is top notch and the creme syrup was an excellent addition. It was such a kerfuffle trying to get a seat and I felt rudely looked over at times but I'll know how to navigate it next time."}
{"input": "3.5 stars.\n\nChickie's and Pete's is a friendly sports bar, particularly for women, and it has lots of seating for Sunday games. I appreciate the sound booth in the sky, as it means that (admittedly bad) music is played during the commercials, along with special themes for Eagles fans. And, the place seems to be smoke free.\n\nBut, I am not impressed by the famous crab fries, which are crinkled, lightly fried, and seasoned with garlic, chili pepper, and salt. Something about the congealed cheese sauce detracts from the entire experience, and I also prefer my fries to be piping hot. However, there are towers of beer available (complete with taps), which is pleasantly tacky. \n\nWith loads of space, booming sound, cute servers, and rowdy fans, Chickie's and Pete's is a perfect place to catch a game."}
{"input": "Although it is a bit messy, espesh on the first floor, this is still my favorite used bookstore in the city.  I think if you really put the time into taking a gander around the shelves and just forget about how you almost just fell flat on your face from tripping on that oddly placed/forgotten stack of books, then you may just actually find a bunch of great deals.  \n\nThe stack of books just kinda reminds me of the beginning of Ghostbusters, so the clutter never really gets on my nerves."}
{"input": "Jay's is my favorite place to get sushi take-out in center city.  As far as the 3 rolls for $xx.xx deals go (there are many in the area), I've tried quite a few and this is my favorite due to the price, quality, and unique selection.  They have rolls I haven't seen anywhere else.  I haven't tried the other menu selections at Jay's, so this review is based only on that.  If you want to eat in, it's not fancy and a little cramped, but everyone was very friendly and the sushi was still good.  For now, it's my #1 take-out place (I suppose Vic would be #2, for reference).  For the fancy sushi experience, I recommend Umai Umai."}
{"input": "Received surprise flowers from a friend across the country! Got a phone call from Amy's flowers in the morning and confirmed that we'd be home in the afternoon to receive them. They were wrapped in plastic, fresh, and smelled lovely. I might consider using Amy's in the future for my own floral needs!"}
{"input": "Dots Diner is like coming home.  Friendly and attentive staff along with very good Diner food.   I've had breakfast here several days while working and they have exceeded my expectations every day.  Whether your here on pleasure or work there is no better place to start your day than Dots Diner. \n\nTruth in dining leads me to report a less than favorable experience after a string of very good ones.  This morning I arrived at 5:30 am as usual and to be honest it was not the same staff that I had seen for the previous two weeks. \n\nAfter sitting in acknowledged for seven minutes I left and drove up the street where I had a fantastic experience.  \n\nIt's good to be great but there is something to be said for consistency too.  I won't let one underwhelming experience get me too down on Dots."}
{"input": "I'm big on natural, great tasting, organic food, which is why I come here whenever I'm in Florida. Everything I've had here (vegetarian) has been amazing, and the meat dishes my friends order never disappoint. The popovers are amazing, the spinach & chocolate smoothie is a meal in itself. Come here. Often."}
{"input": "CHECK YOUR BILL!  The service was just ok and so was the food.  The big issue I had is when the check was delivered there was an \"ACA Surcharge?\"   \n\nIn case you were wondering what this is, as I did, it's a surcharge the restaurant is sneaking onto the check to cover their expenses for the Affordable Care Act, i.e., Obamacare!  Sorry, but I pay almost $400 a month for health insurance already for me and my child and I don't want to pay for others.  \n\nI did request to take it off which took an additional 30 minutes!  The manager did come to the table and told us the servers are required to tell us upon seating about the surcharge and that its posted on their menus.  We were not warned ahead of time and when I asked to see the menu the manager just said he'd take it off the check.  \n\nWe will not be returning.  The only reason I am giving two stars is the server seemed like a good person and when the food is done right it can be tasty, but there never seems to be any consistency to either."}
{"input": "We stopped at Tako due to the positive reviews on yelp. We brought a bottle of white wine with us, the staff did not bring a ice or a chill bucket for us. It took 45 minutes for our appetizers to come out. The edamame was over cooked and mushy while the spring roll did not look appetizing almost like it was frozen. I could buy better spring rolls from trader joes.\nNext we moved on to our sushi which was sat on the sushi bar for 15 minutes before it was brought to us. The sushi it self was good, but not the best I have ever had,\nIf I came here again I would not buy any appetizers. The service was slow"}
{"input": "We went there last night for the first time. We absolutely loved it all. The food was prepared to order and the ingredients were fresh. We like spicy so we enjoyed it all. A less adventurous eater might not like it as much. The service was fantastic and friendly. We'll go back for sure."}
{"input": "This place is amazing. Staff is friendly. Food is great. Don't miss out on the chorizo and cheese empanada! Chips and guacamole are also amazing. Make sure you check in to get a free empanada."}
{"input": "Just had our Wedding here Saturday November 3rd at the Singleton Pavilion - was absolutely perfect. \n\nWe booked an \"off season\" wedding (Nov-Feb) so got the venue for about 1/4 the normal cost, the view was just amazing. Lush beautiful trees and well kept lawns made for the perfect day. \nThey had grounds keepers there the morning of to clean the restrooms and clean the grounds, also had parking attendants there to guide our guests to our venue. \n\nIf you do book Singleton versus their much larger venue Godric Grove the only major downside is the parking situation - you're guests have to walk quite a ways to get to your venue. And, besides electrical outlets and a sink - its pretty bare. No lighting anywhere so you need to be prepared to have all of the basic things covered. \n\nThe staff was perfect with communication during the booking process and called to confirm everything 1 week prior. \n\nVery, very happy with this venue. Absolutely gorgeous!"}
{"input": "Amazing biscuits and (fill in the blank). Great cocktails too. Highly recommended. A bit busy though."}
{"input": "The only car wash I'll go to in Reno! Friendly with free vacuums! Even the $6 wash leaves you're car spotless"}
{"input": "I really enjoy the sushi here. It always taste so fresh and while their prices aren't the best, for what you get I'm pretty impressed. My husband always gets the teriyaki steak. Compared to other places the teriyaki steak is a little expensive for the quantity /quality. Service is always good, they keep your drinks filled and I have never had to wait too long for food. We don't go out of our way to go here, but if we are in the area we tend to stop in."}
{"input": "I stopped in for an early lunch and was the first customer of the day. After ordering the Bahn Mi style hot dog I sat down and wondered why there were holes in all of the tables. While waiting for my order I was careful not to let my Jones Cream Soda wander to close to these bottle swallowing holes. Then my order arrived...D'oh...the holes were for the giant cone of fries that nestle perfectly in them. The fries were cooked perfectly and arrived with the Sriracha dipping sauce that came at an extra charge. I think that they gave me a different sauce because I didn't taste any of the Sriracha...I would have been happy for the squirt bottle instead. \n\nOverall great food if you want a gourmet style dog. The prices are high but consider that the prices are on par with sporting venues that have plain ole dogs on stale buns."}
{"input": "Great location, if you are down in clearer great little shop with many stuff to buy at a good price. The workers are very friendly they talk about hogan and make it a fantastic atmosphere."}
{"input": "Went to Reno for a weekend getaway with two friends. Have been to Vegas so many times and I know it's unfair to have the same expectation about Reno but I was expecting some decent buffet food. The Buffet is one of the higher ratings buffet in Reno but I left the restaurant with a half-empty stomach because the food was very unattractive..\n\nThe best dish there I would say was roasted duck - yup, Chinese dish for some reason. Steamed fish was okay too. But the meat (forgot whether it's prime rib or tritip) was super dry and hard to chew. Salad ingredients were not very fresh. Mussel, crab legs were not fresh at all. Desserts were all either too sweet or having some strange taste..\n\nWith a price tag of ~$25, I could have got much better food in ordinary buffet place in the Bay Area. Next time when I'm in Reno again, I would rather pay a little bit more and get some nicer food in regular restaurants rather than trying buffets at all."}
{"input": "This is a good alternative to Chipotle. They have a huge selection of salsas and hot sauces. We had chicken tacos and veggie quesadilla. Food tastes good, service is quick and good seating options.. indoor and outdoor."}
{"input": "Love this place! Come here frequently with friends for the coconut cake and a cup of coffee :)"}
{"input": "Deseree has done my hair for over a decade and I wouldn't trust anyone else. From blonde to brunette, to long or short, she does it all. She's styling my hair for my upcoming wedding plus 6 bridesmaids and I have no doubt it'll be picture perfect. Deseree is accommodating, dependable,and experienced (oh, and hilarious too )!!"}
{"input": "I can't say enough good things.   Their Gyros are amazing.  We stopped in the bakery on the way home.  I had the Chocolate Kok and it was really good.  5 stars!"}
{"input": "Want Gang is a \"go-to\" in our family. The food is similar in style to that of PF Cheng's but is prepared with fresher ingredients. The food and wait staff are always phenomenal. That paired with a full service bar and monthly cocktails makes this place a winner! \n\nThe happy hour is the bomb with half off everything except for a couple items. Full entrees, full appetizers, and drinks weekdays from 3-5!"}
{"input": "Had a play date here yesterday with my 2 year old son and his friend who is almost 2. This place is awesome! My favorite was the butterfly house. Of course the kids enjoyed the train ride and the carousel ride. But to see them enjoy the water sprinklers was my favorite part! Definitely will be bringing my son back and would recommend this place especially for toddlers. It's not Disney world but it's a great place to visit."}
{"input": "The pizza had no taste and the wings that I ordered didn't even come buffalo, they came plain which I know for a fact I asked for mild wings... even the chicken was flavorless. Won't be ordering again."}
{"input": "love the wine flights and pint YUM night specials!"}
{"input": "They have pretty decent hours, particularly on Sunday.  There beer isn't overpriced, but their craft beer options are good, but not great, in my opinion.  They have been having a lot of sales reps coming into the store for samplings, at least lately, so it's a nice opportunity to try something new. If you happen to be lucky enough to be there on one of those days!"}
{"input": "Beautiful restaurant in a great location!  Came in for dinner before heading to a show at The Straz. Best decision I made that day for sure!  I made reservations for an early dinner so I was seated at a comfortable booth. \n\nMenu was steak centric for sure so I went with the Ribeye. I also indulge in calamari, raw oysters and a bottle of Groth Cab. Service was top notch and the experience was first class all the way. \n\nThe ribeye was spot on mid-rare. Calamari was the best I've had in Florida and the oysters (blue points) were as fresh as could be. \n\nAnd you know what else happened?  The GM, AGM and Executive Chef all stopped by the table to ensure everything was perfect. I felt like a Zagat critic!  \n\nNext time I'm in Tampa I'm making Timpano my first stop. \n\nApparently they treat everyone like a big shot there..."}
{"input": "Mahi Mahi was great, large portion. You could split a meal.You must like smoked fish. Server was pleasant."}
{"input": "The chicken is over rated. It's better from Acme. The donuts, even the fancy one's seem plain."}
{"input": "Delicious pastries and coffee!! Friendly & accommodating staff and open, bright environment. Had the butterscotch bowtie- it was big but so good I finished it all. Highly recommend."}
{"input": "honestly this place is hit or miss. I ALWAYS get the same thing. Jr bacon cheeseburgers and fries. sometimes the fries are hot but alot of the times they arnt. I'll either get a good burger or like the other night a burger w green tomatos. But then again you get what you pay for at a fast food restaurant."}
{"input": "I have been a member of Hand and Stone off and on since 2008.  I have visited the Marlton, NJ branch as well as the Willow Grove, PA branch.  This weekend was my first time at the Flourtown location.  All the locations have good therapist, clean, and polite staff, but I will say I truly enjoyed everything about the Flourtown location.  The staff seems more attentive and the massage therapist was one of the best I've had within the Hand and Stone chain, but also other spas that I have visited.  He was great!  I would recommend this chain and branch to everyone!"}
{"input": "Love this place!  Stopped in for a drink and a snack on Valentine's Day.  The staff was friendly and accommodating.  We sat at the bar and chatted with the bartender a bit.  Loved the decor and the fact they only show 80s movies on their TV.  We had beef fat fries - life changing - so good! Overall great experience!"}
{"input": "I came often for the $1 Beers/Wells on Thursday nights. Finally decided to stop in for lunch.\n\nGreat food here. Blackened Salmon sandwich with a side of fries for $12.50 caught my attention on the menu.  Will definitely come back for seconds."}
{"input": "yum-my!! apple cobbler definately did it after a delicious dinner across the street! ...\n\nmust come back again next time i'm visiting from CA!!"}
{"input": "Came here for breakfast on a Saturday morning. Had to wait 15 minutes for a table. The interior is very boring, just a bunch of booths with no decor to speak of.\n\nVery small and uninspiring menu that is out of date. Nothing but fatty traditional breakfast items with subpar ingredients and subpar presentation. I had the fruit plate which consisted of some grapes, some melon, and an english muffin for $7. My friends had omlettes and breakfast burritos, which were okay but nothing special.\n\nSunrise Cafe and Original Pancake House are much better breakfast spots in Fishers."}
{"input": "I like the Neuvo-Latino-Americano grub here.  The place has moved locations and is now a bit larger.  Chips & Salsa are always fresh 7 tasty, too.\n\nI wish I could give a more substanital review but I ate here so long ago - and at the old location - so I'd better just keep my mouth shut."}
{"input": "I was very impressed with Trattoria Marcella. A little place tucked in the historic Hill neighborhood of St. Louis did not disappoint with their large well put together Italian dishes. The Lasagna jumped out of the menu and caught my eye. When I finally got my much anticipated meal i was shocked at the size of the dish. I took my first bite and I was in heaven. It was probably the most delicious lasagna i have had other than my mothers, obviously. All in all Trattoria Marcella is a place you must try if you venture off into the historic Italian Neighborhood of St. Louis Missouri."}
{"input": "Movie food is always high. The seats aren't that comfy, I like the recliner seats at Regal theatres. Tge staff is always wonderful. The bathroom is USUALLY clean. The audio/video is awesome. (Not a 3-d fan, don't recommend it). My usual hangout spot."}
{"input": "I stopped into the Flourtown location of the Head and Stone Massage and Facial chain today because I wanted to treat myself & work out some of the tension in my shoulders and neck. \n\nI liked that I was able to very quickly and easily make an appointment online - Mia at the front desk made the whole process easy and she was very welcoming. The environment was very relaxing with music and a heated massage table as well as extremely clean. \n\nMy therapist was Jason & he did a great job! I went for the Swedish massage but would probably get the deep tissue next time - he did a great job of working out the knots in my neck while making me feel comfortable. \n\nThey accept walk-ins which is great if you're an on the go kind of person & they offer an introductory price for first-timers & offer memberships with reduced prices if that's something that interests you. Would recommend!"}
{"input": "Good food, though I felt like the portions were smaller than I was expecting for the price. I'm surprised that other Yelper's rated this two dollar signs. I also wish they'd had gluten free soy sauce. Other than that, there is really nothing to complain about and I still was able to enjoy my meal."}
{"input": "This museum has been on my list of places I need to visit for a while now. I finally got the chance. \nIt's currently under construction for a remodel but the exhibit is untouched. \nThe stories of survivors as well as their relatives is displayed very well. Family pictures show so much detail of how people lived before the holocaust. I was so sad to see the evidence of how blind people were to the atrocities that the Jews faced during this time. \nThey showed how many different groups were enslaved by the Nazi regime for being different. \nI hope more people will visit this museum and learn how easily and quickly hate can change and ruin lives. \nIn my opinion, everyone should see this exhibit. Highly recommended."}
{"input": "Three letters, WOW!  Food was excellent and relatively cheap for the FQ.  Our waitress Kerry was excellent.  I had the big easy breakfast which came with lots of food that I could not finish.  The pancakes were the best part of the meal.  Glad we skipped the hotels breakfast of pastries to eat here.  I would highly recommend!"}
{"input": "Four stars for the beer, atmosphere and usually service. There is a reason this place is always packed! Half price beer during a generous happy hour, a huge deck that welcomes dogs, and delicious key lime pie.   Sadly, said deck allows smoking, and there is usually lots of it. I wish they at least had a nonsmoking side. \n\nIf giving a review just based on the food, I would give it a two. The pretzels are ok, but the cheese dip is Velveeta nastiest. As a native Wisconsinite, I take offense at plastic cheese. Then, there's the pretzel bun sandwiches. I've sampled the chicken, brat and Italian sausage. It's pricey, considering it comes with potato chips (seriously guys?! Get a fryer!) and just ok. The buns were kind of soggy and the overall experience underwhelming, especially knowing the epic sandwiches for sale next door. I wish the Village pub would focus on what it's best that, serving beer, and let us bring Mitchell's sandwiches over."}
{"input": "My favorite brunch spot in Tucson!!! Always the nicest servers and most unique food. I haven't found a brunch spot that balances sweet and savory like Prep. I have gotten the duck confit twice now which is saying something because before prep & pastry I had never tried duck before! Pro tip make sure you spring for a dossant it's well worth it."}
{"input": "Finally the brick and mortar version of Spot has arrived!  Inventive burgers, the freshest ingredients and a lively, family friendly atmosphere. Get there during the off peak times if you want to be ensured a seat. This place fills up fast!  Looking forward to eating my way through the burgers, then the other hot specialty sandwiches.  \n\nStill sniffing the fat and juices on my fingers long after the burger is gone. Sad to have to wash my hands."}
{"input": "Many reasons why I love Irish Pol.\n\n1. Beers on tap are of wide variety and bountiful!\n\n2. Located in Olde City, within walking distance of everything you need.\n\n3. First level has that smalltown cozy irish bar feeling that ignites a warm fuzzy sensation.\n\n4. Second floor feels like your walking into a modern martini like bar, pinky fingers extended is a must.\n\n5. Two words... Stoner...Platter.   Everything that is wrong for you but right when it's well past your bedtime and you've spent your entire night drinking. It's a huge platter of fried goodness!!! French fries, onion rings, mozzerella sticks, fried pierogies and thats naming just a few!\n\nYum"}
{"input": "I think the coffee is great and the food is yummy. The iced coffee is delicious and I also enjoy their homemade syrups (caramel is AWESOME). My fav snack they have their is the avocado toast with a poached egg on top. SO GOOD. I find their coffee and food can be a bit expensive but the quality is good so I don't want to complain too much. Since Buddy Brew is such a Tampa institution, the shop can get kind of crowded which is what demotes it to 4 stars for me. I'm glad their business is doing well, but I like a quieter coffee shop vibe. \n\nDefinitely a place to stop by if you haven't been before!"}
{"input": "I'd like to begin by praising the venue's name, which I think is pretty clever given the location and all.\n\nAll right, moving on, the highlight for me was being able to walk into the restaurant after 11pm, when the restaurant closes at midnight, after I had just seen a concert across the street at The Pageant and having the server / bartender look me dead in the eyes, not even flinch and say, \"Sure you can order food, have a seat. Do you want a beer?\"\n\nYes. Yes I do.\n\nPizza-wise they only serve thin crust or Chicago-style. I'm not a huge thin crust fan so I went with the Chicago. It hit the spot. So did the couple of St. Louis brews I drank to wash it down.\n\nGood food. Great hospitality. I can't recommend them enough."}
{"input": "Nice neighborhood bar.  Specials galore and the drinks keep flowing.  Cant complain."}
{"input": "Wife absolutely loved the scramble.  They have children toys and books.  My son read a book while we waited for our food.  I got the breakfast sandwich and it was decent but I felt toast was too crispy.  Im just being picky its a nice breakfast cafe with moderate prices.  Id prefer to give it 4 stars but my wife wouldnt stop talking about how much she loved her breakfast so Im going with a 5."}
{"input": "For appetizers, we had the scallion pancakes and the seafood soup. They were delicious.  I wanted the Peking Noodles, but the sauce contained meat, which I do not eat.  However, the owner was nice enough and made accommodations for me.  The lychee smoothie was yummy and actually tasted like lychee. They use real fruit here.  Everyone at our table was satisfied with the food and service."}
{"input": "Pizza was great, delivery was quick, and the delivery man was nice. All-in-all a great pick for anyone enduring long nights of studying."}
{"input": "I'd like to move in and make this my home. I LOVE this place. There hasn't been one time where I have gone in and they haven't had what I was looking for. Even weird off the wall things. They have something for everyone... all price points and everyone one that works there is super helpful. Yay for booze!"}
{"input": "The food was great, good enough that I will return, but the service was well... interesting. Our server was too friendly. Coming over often just to start conversation with us and even sitting down with us towards the end of the meal to talk to us. I appreciate friendly service, but this was a little too much. I however got the Bison burger and it was wonderful, and the beer was great too!"}
{"input": "great tossed salad, phenomenal spaghetti agli olio. i'm glad we walked six miles before we ate because the portions are big. great pasta, so-so wine but wonderful customer service. don't go for the pizza. prices seemed a little high for a little pizzeria but the pasta is worth it and so is the friendliness of the staff."}
{"input": "Best desserts ever! Dark and sinister is AMAZING. Really anything with that uses the chocolate ice cream is my favorite."}
{"input": "I have to say being a regular customer of Rouse's there is a big improvement in the customer service since it was Sav-A-Center. There are the cashier's that will look at you like you are crazy if you try to make conversation with them. Then there are the regulars that are actually nice. I went yesterday and had a cashier that was completely mute. And I loved hearing the bag boy mention how he hoped no one else would get in line so he could get a break. I do have to say the managers are great. The tall bearded wine guy is always helpful. And there is this one short guy that's always gathering grocery carts that will ask if you need help loading groceries. That is always nice!"}
{"input": "This review is strictly for the tomato pie: amazing! I love it-- someone brought this to my niece's birthday party and I've eaten almost a half of sheet to myself. The sauce is sweet and the dough is simply great. It is a shame that I don't live nearby or I'd be ordering it often!"}
{"input": "I fell in love with the place the moment I walked in! My (now) wife and I decided to have our wedding here because of the beautiful location, the wonderfully friendly proprietors, and the convenience of being able to have the lodging, ceremony, and reception all in the same place. We took the Lighthouse Suite and never wanted to leave, it was so comfy. All in all, I'm 100% happy with this place and would recommend it HIGHLY to anyone looking to spend a night or even planning a wedding!\n\nIf anything, spend some time there to be around the owners Wilder and Bill. You can tell they love what they do. They have a great sense of humor and really did everything they could to help make our big day run smoothly.\n\nEven though I live down the road from here, I will look for ANY excuse to spend another night here!"}
{"input": "so, KELP just keeps getting better. In the the last year and a half not only did they add an adorable outside area where you are seated under globe string lights but more importantly the menu got a major upgrade. \n\n1) Theres more vegetarian rolls on the menu than any other sushi place Ive ever been to. EVER. & they're really really good! like REALLY great! \n\n2) They now have BOWLS, for kids and adults \n\n3) The previous omg they give you brown rice without an upcharge got even better! \nHere are the options: Brown rice - no extra charge,  Rice PAPER- no extra charge,  Cucumber wrap ($2), Soy paper ($1.50), make your roll Tempura style ($1) \n\n4) alcohol & FRIED ICE CREAM.\n\n** Stil have the amazing lunch Special!!! **"}
{"input": "The Belleview Biltmore is a hotel on the historic register - that means it is classy, old and a little worn around the edges.  But it is still a great place.\n\nThere are two pools (we only found the outdoor one, but who cares it was Florida in May and it is muggy - one pool is enough) and a great restaurant downstairs.  The buffets were excellent - kids eat free with paying guests.\n\nThey also have a bar and beach area in Clearwater with an hourly shuttle.\n\nThere wasn't wifi or internet in the hotel rooms which was strange, but this isn't a hotel catering to business travelers."}
{"input": "Quiet, plenty of comfy seating, solid tea selection, chill music.  Perfect place for working on the laptop.  Not the cheapest place in the world to get a cup of tea, but the incredibly calm vibe is worth every penny."}
{"input": "Today I tried the red velvet and chocolate peppermint cupcakes.  Frosting was very yummy; however, cake was rather dry.  Would expect more from cupcakes that are $3.75 each.  Slightly disappointed."}
{"input": "Love the moon roll here the sushi is always great good atmosphere..I like to come after I workout"}
{"input": "We had the Italian sausage sweet potato hash, the beef sweet potato hash and the Brie stuffed French toast. It was amazing and I am now swimming in a glorious food coma. I will come back here over and over again. It's packed and a little loud in here, but I would expect that from an awesome brunch place. Just be prepared to wait 15-20 mins for your table on a Saturday/Sunday."}
{"input": "Suzie was awesome! Great location, comfortable atmosphere, quick and friendly service. Looking forward to being a regular client from now on!"}
{"input": "Braving the twisting road and hiking down to get there (NO parking.)we were met with a what i will call; THE REST STOP. If your idea of a \"Special Night\" out involves sitting in the dirt on tree stumps watching LA poseurs vaping after all-day wine binging sounds fun, this is your kinda place. Their walk-in hut offers beer only, no place inside to sit and relax. The outdoor BBQ sandwiches feed the crowd as they stare at the road to see who arrives next. The band was good, but were crammed into a corner of the dirt, near the beer hut with no dance floor.The only place of solace is the Tavern itself, and a charming respite from the outside. My ribs were tasty, but my husband's fish entre was a big disappointment. The servers were tense feeding the crowd on a holiday weekend. In short, I will never be back. The whole vibe just sucked."}
{"input": "Fresh baked goods with Kawha coffee. Their concept of selling mini size cakes is genius. My kids ordered a couple mini size cakes with a mini glass of milk. One mini with milk is just $1.50. The owner is passionate about this shop and I hope they grow to the point that they can be open everyday. The best item on the menu is the banana pie. I also like the red velvet and chocolate caramel."}
{"input": "I was pleased to find at least one men's store on Magazine St.  It made the day of shopping a little more fun for my husband!  Denton was in the market for some cute casual T's.  He found one here for a very reasonable price.  They have some places to sit down while your husband shops.  \n\nIf we were locals, we would definitely come back here!"}
{"input": "I have never had any issues with this place and we have been here many times. This is the only paint store I have ever been to besides places like Home Depot or Lowes...so as far as a paint places goes it ranks high on my list. Not only do they sale paint but also everything that you need to get the job done. Everyone is extremely friendly and helpful. They keep your paint information on file so you don't have to remember it if you need to purchase more. I normally go when there is a sale on paint...keep an eye out for 30% off....we buy interior Super Paint which was a part of the deal."}
{"input": "Amazing pizza. AMAZING! After my first bite, I felt like that Oprah Winfrey meme, where her head is thrown back, her mouth is agape and her arms are open wide, and she's screaming, \"You get a car!\" Except it's not Oprah, it's me. And I don't get a car -- I get a pizza. But I felt that excited.  \n\nThis is basically the pizza I have been looking for since moving to the Indianapolis area. It's a whole lot of nothing: It's not cut into square pieces. It's not crispy and thin. It's not redolent of oregano. It's thick and chewy, cheesy, greasy, wonderful -- it tastes the way pizza is supposed to taste! I have found my new pizza home."}
{"input": "Unassuming location. Friendly staff. Neighborhood vibe. I was at first a little hesitant about ordering 10 to 15 dollar plates at dinner for a casual night out for Mexican food, but when the food was placed before us, beautifully plated, I got lost in the excitement of the first taste. Quality ingredients and balanced spices with  the meats cooked just right kept me high on flavors until our plates were licked clean! I will be back to taste more! Another review might be in order to list my favorite dishes, but I have a feeling that I'll be happy with the entire menu."}
{"input": "Rex's first visit won't be his last! I loved the fact Zoey was familiar with the breed. He came home handsome and smelling great."}
{"input": "The food is OK, but is ruined by the awful atmosphere.  Two of the employees calling each other \"faggots\" and the deafening rap music with every other word being \"motherf****r\" made it seem that they wanted customers to leave.  Order carryout or eat outside, but eating inside is a miserable experience.  Note to employees\" Keep your homophobic slurs to where customers aren't able to hear them."}
{"input": "I hate the dentist... well, I should say I hated the dentist. I was nervous and anxious about going in to get a tooth fixed that had broke. I seriously waited until the last possible moment to go in and boy I'm glad I went here! Dr. Shawa is amazing, he was patient, kind and compassionate.  I've never met a dentist that was so awesome.  He helped me understand what to do differently to prevent cavities. He not only told me he showed me. He didn't harp on things I did wrong but things I can do in the future. The entire experience was exceptionally pleasant and his staff was great! \n\nNot only am I not scared to go back, I can't wait to go back and fix the rest of my cavities once and for all!"}
{"input": "We made it to the friendship gate,\nand I really just can't wait,\n\nI found out that thing was sushi and not fishing bait,\ncome to shop or if you're out on a date,\n\nDon't be late\nto the Chinatown friendship gate"}
{"input": "I actually eat here at least once a month . The food is good and the service compliments it. You will fall in love with there zucchini muffins. I always leave with some stashed in my purse, you know for later. The prices are cheap and they have a fantastic frozen yogurt bar . with unlimited toppings. Have fun !! yum yum"}
{"input": "I  dream of a day they will open a venue in Colorado! I know the best thing about this chain is their tasty slushes, and that we get long cold winters, but they are addictive and if we have friggen pinkb***ies we should have an Eegee's! \n\nThose tasty treats go amazingly with booze, and I must get one each trip to Tucson.  The food is why it doesn't get a fifth star, but who goes there for the food?!?\n\nStar light, star bright.............."}
{"input": "Happiness is finding rose petals sprinkled around our bathtub upon our room arrival! Not to mention the great cappuccino machine at check in and bikes to borrow as we head out. Great place to stay...love it!! Only negative (if there was one) is I'd love if the bathrooms were a bit more updated, larger vanity space and low flow fixtures would be nice. All in all it's a nice place. Love the fireplace in our room."}
{"input": "There was too much driving and not enough touring.  We walked 15 min each in the cemetary and sculpture park.  The rest of the tour was a quick look and try to see out of the windows of a packed bus.  But it was a great way to see all sides of the big easy.  Donna was a knowledgeable tour guide.  She told jokes and stories about the history of this great city."}
{"input": "The bun makes the Sonoran Dog. It's like a snuggie for the pup. A first, it seems ridiculous and almost like it's going to be too much, exactly like everyone's favorite blanket with sleeves. Too much softness, too much smush, too indulgent.  Wrong. It's warm, soft, chewy, fragrant, and it succeeds where other famed Sonoran Dogs fail. \n\nThe hot dog itself is flavorful, but I would prefer that it or the bacon have a little more bite or snap to better hold their own against the dominant mustard and onions. \n\nI'm with the masses on the carne asada caramelo. Excellent tortilla, salty, melty cheese, and great carne. \n\nSuper cheap and you can drive through."}
{"input": "*This review is just about the Fountain Grill*\n\nWow, this was one of the best meals i've eating in a long long time. I never say that. \n\nDinner was so good, that I even ordered a Woodford Reserve to make it an occasion. The GF got a glass of red and form the start the service was really good. \n\nHouse Salad - check!\nHot Bread & Butter - check!\nPrime Rib Special - check!\nChicken Cordon Blue - check!\n\nBoth dinners were cooked perfect and the taste was amazing. A total surprise for us both.\n\nWe are going to plan another dinner there and get some desert!"}
{"input": "The food is really good!! The service is less than average; I felt very rushed, unimportant, and cheated. Was shocked that the waitress withheld my coins when she gave me my change! Do they withhold change from all of their customers?!! Very disappointed.  Would she have done that to a well known food critic?\n\nWill probably go back one more time eventually but will have lots of change with me to pay the EXACT amount! When it came time to give her tip, I applied the coins she withheld from me -they became part of her tip. Also, her tip dropped from my standard 25% to 15%. Flabbergasted."}
{"input": "Soo disappointed. Ordered delivery and specified that it was from a hotel. They brought no utensils and told them I did not specify them. They changed my order without asking me. The kicker was that the Biryani I ordered had hard things in it, some of which were whole cardamon pods but also (and yuck) a partially eaten stone fruit. Please don't get delivery. If anything eat there, but I will not"}
{"input": "I did not expect this random Taiwanese restaurant outside of Circus Circus was actually REALLY GOOD for American-Taiwanese food standard. Get the braided pork bowl and rolled pancakes."}
{"input": "Long wait if you go on a weekend, but worth the wait. The potatoes are the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had. Bacon was delicious as well. Both the smores and classic french toast were very good! Pricey, but worth it for special occasions."}
{"input": "My husband and I love the early bird specials menu at La Campagnola.  Our favorite is the Pork Chop Normandy.  The chop is double thick, cooked to perfection, with a delicious sliced apple brandy cream sauce that is delicious.  The plate comes with cheesy scalloped potatoes and a freshly prepared vegetable of the day.  Homemade soup or salad is included, as well as dessert.  Our servers have always been friendly and professional, and it is such a treat when we head out for an early dinner at La Campagnola."}
{"input": "Horrible customer service.  Customers should be allowed to try on another size.  The sales associate actually refused to get me another size, which is not what I have experienced at other stores.  I wasn't asking for anything out of the ordinary, I only took in 2 bras and wanted ONE of them in a different size.  The store wasn't busy so I don't understand her reluctance. You can give me advice on how it should fit, but don't make me stand there peeking out of the fitting room doorway, half dressed, trying to justify why I just want to *try* the next size up.  I know how I want my lingerie to fit and will go elsewhere where I won't be put in such a humiliating situation."}
{"input": "Went here when they first opened. They only had one flavor... it wasn't that great. Everything was overpriced and we left spending about 70-80 dollars for three people and it wasn't filling. \n*it is not Cajun style seafood. The sauce tastes like a mixture between buffet style sauces with fish sauce. \nGiving them a solid three because there are better places to eat at"}
{"input": "Well for $229 a night I expected more. I don't know if that was the original price for a night or they charged us that because we were in a need of a room. But any way no privacy at all I was able to hear all the conversation for the room next to us. We were taking  a shower and we were hearing conversations from out side meaning if we were able to hear them than they were hearing us for sure . That kill our whole valentine's  night. For$ 229 the trash cans had no bag for $229 one of the lamps were not working for $229 you had to hold the iron to keep it on.REALLY!!!  The room next door was totally drama. Wouldn't recommended  at all ."}
{"input": "Yep, mind blown! Fresh ingredients, good price, large portions, and there's nothing flashy about it. I absolutely love this place and I will certainly spread the word and come back!! Nice job, SoCo, and keep up the good work!!!"}
{"input": "Delicious and very nicely presented. We had J Sushi and Fire Roll and fantastic. Excellent service and great value."}
{"input": "Well if you like customer service then this is your kind of place. As soon as you walknin the door you get that lovely sound \"can I help you find something\"! You never have to hunt somebody down. They always have most everything the big box retailer stores have or they will get it for you. Oh and the newest thing is they can replace your high-tech chip car keys for a fraction of the cost."}
{"input": "Very good local ice cream. Expresso chip. Moose tracks. Graham Slam are all custom made flavors."}
{"input": "Mike and his team make it a pleasure to have a car serviced. They are knowledgeable, honest, and extremely friendly. I'm a loyal customer."}
{"input": "Hot means actually hot here.\n\nI ordered hot beef soup. Broth was clean and tasty, beef was surprisingly good - it was a real meat, not an ordinary cheap-pho-place-frozen-meat-like-substance. The only drawback - the soup was too oily.\n\nGonna visit this place again to check out theirs pho. It should be really good.\n\nSome oddities:\n1. For the first time in my life I asked for chopsticks - I was served with spoon and fork. Funny :)\n2. This place has a strange ambience.\n\nFinal line: good broth and good beef."}
{"input": "Let me just give you the tl;dr: best sandwich shop in all of STL.\n\nBuffalo sandwich is what I ended up getting here. Great portion, saucy meat without the food being too dried. Great balance of sandwich, meat, and veggies. I came near the end of their lunch hour and got to speak with the owner just for a bit before they closed up. That really set the mood for me as we bonded over our love for great music and our travel between Orange County/LA and St. Louis. \n\nOnly urk was the amount of flies by the window. Not sure how and where it came from, but that didn't bother me as much because that sandwich is just that good."}
{"input": "On the same lines as any of the Scotty's Brewhouses around Indiana, but this one prides itself for being organic.  Also has a list of beers from different Indiana breweries (a plus in my book).  I had a bison burger which I really liked and would recommend it to any burger fan."}
{"input": "This place is great! The food is fast and fresh and their burritos are on point. They even have a kids menu. All of their dishes are extremely customizable so you can get your food just the way you want it. Very nice for a counter service restaurant."}
{"input": "Awesome Peruvian food. I have only been there twice but I really enjoyed their tasteful plates. Bistec a la Chorrillana is a must have."}
{"input": "I heard alot about Honey's and how the food is so good here. I chose today my birthday to be my first visit .I read earlier reviews about how crowded it gets and they were not lying but I didn't wait no more than 20 minutes. Now let's get down to the food it was delicious. I had french toast, home fries, sausage and for dessert a slice of Jewish apple cake and it was to die for! I will be back most definitely."}
{"input": "I have never \"Dined In\" but get carryout pizza at Luca's regularly.  Pizza is great and they are always extremely friendly/courteous... Usually even throw in an order or two of garlic knots and marinara sauce on the house.. Definitely one of the better pizza places in Telford/Souderton area..."}
{"input": "Best, freshest Mexican in Franklin. Good Margaritas too. Owners and wait staff are friendly. Great family run business."}
{"input": "Id you haven't been to the Smoothie King center since it was know as the New Orleans Arena, you are in for a nice surprise. The arena has had a face lift and, while the seats are the same,  everything else has been refreshed.   \n\nMost importantly,  the food options are far more varied and appeal to many tastes.  The quality of the food is very good and significantly improved from a few years back. The drink options are much improved as well and include full service bars, spiked lemonade,  bottled and draft beer and of course, smoothies.  There is even a spot for sweets. You can get funnel cake, cotton candy, and all kinds of delicious things I was too full to take in.  \n\nThe venue finally feels a bit swanky and top notch.  We are moving on up!"}
{"input": "I have eaten here twice now. Both meals were incredible. Great service and ambiance. This has the feel of a restaurant in NYC. If you are in downtown Clw, try this place out!łl"}
{"input": "The first time I went to this place was yesterday!! I've lived in NOLA all my life and feel guilty that I have never come across. The food was delicious, especially the shrimp and grits. A++!!!"}
{"input": "Great little Starbucks hubs and I came across when we were visiting NOLA! Great neighborhood, clean and great service!"}
{"input": "When I found that Callie had departed my heart sunk, but I desperately needed a haircut, so I placed myself in Ellen's hands.  She did an equally good job, and was dryly funny.  If I hadn't done something stupid like graduated and moved away I would be going to her to this day.  As is, I'm in need of a haircut and considering an expensive plane ticket!  \n\nI have sent friends to other stylists here, and curly or straight their hair has always come out looking amazing, so really, you can't go wrong.  And Ellen gave me a great cut for my wavy/straight/confused hair, and even styled it for going out that night!  Seriously, if you're in St. Louis and need a haircut, head here.  Do it for me."}
{"input": "A decent coffeehouse with lots of seats & tables for working, but there's no WiFi, which makes it kind of a useless cafe if you want to do work. Both of the green teas sold here were very refreshing though."}
{"input": "I am not known for favorable restaurant reviews.  Most of them below my radar.\nThe Love is different.  \n  We had a Father's Day lunch that was exceptional.\nThere is little left off the menu and we were hard pressed to make a choice from the wonderful selections listed.  Our waiter was professional and accommodating.  Lovely atmosphere, light and bright.  I was amazed that the inside of my omelet was HOT. A little surprise thrown in with my Potatos..........roasted peppers, and onions.\nGreens on every plate. Mine had warm spinach salad as well. My husband had the Belgium waffles made with corn meal and garnished with Blueberry butter.  They use our favorite La Columbe coffee.\nNothing left to wish for."}
{"input": "Always a good choice for a impromptu night out as well as date night.  There is a great variety of choices and you can never go wrong with a burger from here. I really, really like their A2 sauce especially with my fries.  Variety of beers, as well as a full bar. And there is always a terrific special.  Not a really fancy place but a little more upscale casual, comfortable and friendly service.  Their iced tea is good as well. Dessert we always have the lemon meringue,  delicious! We hear their rotisserie meat is terrific and what they are known for but we always get distracted from trying it by one of the other yummy choices,  some day soon though, we're going to have to try it!\nReasonable price for the great quality!"}
{"input": "Tonight was our first time at Tired Hands. We came in for Taco Monday, which means $2 off every taco on the menu & half-price pints of HopHands and SaisonHands. The tacos & the beers (we tried Hop, Saison, Helles Other People, Cause & Concern, and Paper Mansions) were all incredible. I do wish that the tortillas used for the tacos has been warmed, instead of just filled, but tacos were still good nonetheless. Service was super friendly as well. Wish we lived closer so this place could become one of our regular spots, but we'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"input": "Pulling up to the burg you might think it's a weird spot for a diner- it's a small strip mall with a barber and a real estate agent but it's worth the visit. \n\nThe owner Bill is there just about every day- he takes his time to greet and thank every table.  His mom is usually there to greet and fill your coffee.  They all, including the servers, try to always remember you and your favorites.\n\nMy personal favorite is the hungry Greek.  My family and I typically all order the combo. For around $10 you get 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 meat of your choice, potato or grits and toast. The pancakes are easily the best in St Pete! They have a sweetness to them, maybe vanilla, that just kicks them up a notch. \n\nAlways check the chalkboards for their specials, they usually will have a fun pancake like strawberry cheesecake or peanut butter cup, as well as a skillet or breakfast burrito option.\n\nIf you go for lunch- get the burger.  Perfectly seasoned with fresh cut fries."}
{"input": "This Quizno's always gets it done for me. I come here often on my lunch break, and I usually have a pleasant experience. The line moves fast, and the food is typically good. \n\nBOTTOM LINE: If you're craving a sub, but not Subway, come to Quiznos. This location as good as any."}
{"input": "I came here for lunch and was very disappointed.  Bland and expensive for the amount and quality of food we received.  Lukewarm, nearly tasteless (how can Mexican food be tasteless???) and a total waste of my lunch hour.\n\nMeh.  Do yourself a favor and support the many authentic, locally owned, non-chain Mexican restaurants.\n\nI was wishing that I had gone to Mi Pueblo instead......."}
{"input": "After 3 weeks of working in the area I finally found a place off of Magazine that is not overrated. Friendly staff! Y'all know I love Phò so it's pretty damn good!"}
{"input": "We just got back from our cemetery tour with Ernie. We were thrilled with Ernie, he was very knowledgable and entertaining on top of that. Not only did he educate us on some history of NOLA, he made us laugh and enjoy the time. As we walked through St. Louis Cemetery, I overheard other tour guides giving their tour; wow was I glad I booked with Ernie and not them....lighten up people and be a little more energetic like Ernie!"}
{"input": "Doctor Jeffers is one of the best vets I have ever dealt with, she shows compassion for all animals and can tell you within hours of literally anything that is wrong, plus very reasonable prices.\n\nDr Jeffers even accepts reptiles so being able to get that kind of service locally is great considering another vet on street road gouges you big time for just a vitamin shot ( 105.00 minimum charge )\n\nPlus the practice has just about every type of machinery to insure that they know exactly what is going on with your pet. She even has animals for adoption. \n\nOne great vet, as good as Dr Pol."}
{"input": "A great family run little BYOB with absolutely fantastic food and even better service. There is no better Italian in Philly. My Sicilian grandmother loved it, what more proof do you need?\n\nStop reading this and go there. Do it now."}
{"input": "Food was nothing special. I think this place gets a lot of hype because they push alcohol really hard to make it have a fun vibe. I mean, it's not bad, but it's not worth the price either."}
{"input": "Great food.  Good cocktails.  Decent service, although,  the staff could afford to dress distinctly different since its hard to identify them from they other customers.  The bathrooms are a nightmare though.  There simply are not enough when it's busy, which  it is frequently.  Kills the good experience."}
{"input": "This place is beautiful to stay. Loud music shouldn't bother you if you stay here though. If you can get over the loud music then stay here. Clean,friendly, and food is great."}
{"input": "Gross, just gross. I ordered the white meat fried chicken with Mac and cheese and garlic mashed potatoes as my sides. Chicken was slimy and salty. Sides were both cold and practically flavorless. Not to mention service was strange. Server busted out laughing while I was giving my order. It made me uncomfortable as if he was laughing at us. I didn't understand. Will not be back."}
{"input": "In short, the food was decently good, but completely overpriced.  The guacamole and my Mojito were probably the highlight of the meal. I had the peach pork medallions, which were nicely cooked, but lacked flavor. I tried the corn cakes with Barbacoa and that was pretty good.  \n\nThe atmosphere was inviting with a hip feel if that's what you're looking for.  What was really annoying was the parking situation. For a place with price points such as these and limited parking spaces, a valet service should be provided either at a cost or complimentary.  Don't even try and park in the back of the building, it's tight and dangerous even getting there and back.  I ended up parking three blocks away and broke a sweat walking in the dead of summer to the front entrance."}
{"input": "Food is amazing but the ladies at the front need to work on their customer service. I've been in 3 times in the last 2 weeks and they have been dismissive about my questions every time I've been in. Feels like I'm better at customer service than they are. \nIf they fix this, would get 5 stars. \nShout out to the cooks!"}
{"input": "Great flavors, solid service, only a few things lacking on the execution (a little bit of clumping in my grits, brussels sprouts a little too spicy for a breakfast dish)."}
{"input": "One of new orleans' best. I have a tattoo Jamie did almost 20 years ago that still looks as good as it did the day I got it."}
{"input": "Love love love this place for HH n dinner is good too! Its ok for brunch, not as great as what people praise it to be. The Asian Nachos are the dish to get for HH. Its an entree itself! The other HH dishes are great too. The creme brulee is amazing as with their other desserts. The blueberry mojito is awesome along with the mango sling. Great place to celebrate birthdays and such.  Nice feel to it. Bar area gets crowded as it gets later for HH. As usual around the mall, finding parking sux!"}
{"input": "What can be said that isn't said already?\n\nAtmosphere: clean, efficient, but classy. Good quality seating. Comfortable. \n\nFood: Those cooks know what they are doing. The food for breakfast and lunch is astounding. The prices seem high-ish, but actually, you get a lot of food that fills you just to the brink of super-fullness.\n\nCoffee: they serve French Truck coffee here. Great iced coffee! Meh iced latte, at least for a large. Too much milk. Gimme more of that espresso!\n\nSpeed: great on weekdays! Weekends are another matter for me; there is always a line out of the door! This is their fault, as the great food and customer service keeps people coming back. Man, so many people though. Ugh and they're gonna be loud and talking about things. Hell, I'll just come back on a weekday."}
{"input": "$0.75 Oyster Happy Hour, need I say more? \n\nSeriously though, the oysters were delicious...all 26 of them. We also tried the chicken liver pate and the cheesy jalapeño grits. The grits, OMG the grits. They were so damn good, even the cold leftovers I ate the next morning were still delicious."}
{"input": "Love this place...best hot dogs and chili dogs around...i go here as many times as i can..yum"}
{"input": "I love this place. It's just down the street from me so I'm there probably every other week... don't judge me! They rotate their flavors regularly and if at first you don't see a topping you'd like be sure and ask if they have it because they keep some under the counter!\n\nThis place also busts out some pretty intense EDM music over their sound system, which is somewhat bizarre but wholly awesome!"}
{"input": "We love Mamma Maria's!  The aroma of garlic is enjoyable & makes you anticipate the delights in store when you enter the restaurant. \n\nWe started out with a very friendly server who took our drink orders and appetizer order & told us about the soup of the day. Her name was Tracey. She promptly delivered our drinks and let us know that Kristen would be taking over serving.    A very courteous gesture in my opinion.   Kristen was bubbly, friendly & very attentive.  \n\nNow for the food, the calamari fritta was delicious and lightly battered. This was tender and had a delicious flavor, served with a chunky flavorful marinara and juicy lemon wedges. The white pizza was delicious and mouthwatering. The crust crispy and the abundant flavor of the roasted garlic was a delight! Always delicious and always consistent.\n\nLooks like they have a tempting selection of desserts, but I showed some discipline and didn't indulge."}
{"input": "After an unsuccessful first experience with this pizza place, the owner contacted me and generously offered to deliver another pizza in the future, free of charge.  Tonight, I took him up on his kind offer.  We ordered the Pepper pie, which included Peppadews, Jalepenos, Poblano Peppers, Crumbled Hot Sausage, Mozzarella & Red Sauce.  We were not disappointed!  Not only was our order delivered in a very timely manner, but the pizza was fresh, hot, and smelled wonderful!  The pizza was full of flavor, with equal parts sweetness and spiciness.  The crust was also very tasty.  I can definitely say the ingredients were top-notch, as well.  I plan on being a Pizzicare customer in the future, as the business shows excellent customer service and takes pride in their product.  I highly recommend it!"}
{"input": "Terrible, just terrible!  They need to tear this place down immediately.  I remember going here in the 80's for decent pizza & to a movie, but time has passed this place buy.  I went into Kmart to look for backpacks just a week ago and even that was a bad experience.  All there stuff looked old and outdated.   Why don't they turn this place into a Target, its practically empty anyway.  Either the stores have gone out of business for lack of shoppers or wisely moved elsewhere.  Sorry to see this location die a slow death, but its no more than an eye sore now."}
{"input": "I had to make a stop to get one of the staples, the hand grenade!  This drink will get you twisted so be ready in advance. I had two and my night was filled with dancing, singing, laughter, and all the makings of an incredible evening in New Orleans. \n\nYour drink will last you a while and when you feel like you're finished it seems to be more waiting. Great place and great staff!  They were quick getting you in and getting you back out. Cheers!"}
{"input": "I have been to this Wawa many times and it is consistently clean and well stocked. The soft pretzels tend to be fresh and the staff is friendly. There is easy access to both Linden Hill Road and Skyline Drive. It loses one star because they don't offer gas. Otherwise another high-quality Wawa we know and love."}
{"input": "Seriously, whoever gave this place under four stars should just not attempt to enjoy this type of cuisine, and maybe stick to Texas Roadhouse. \n\nHands down, the BEST Indian food in Indy, and better than most places that I have visited anywhere, in any state.\n\nThe restaurant was very clean, and the staff were attentive and enjoyable. \n\nBuffet RULES! I hate to admit it, but it blows away Shalimar and India Garden on every level."}
{"input": "Had a great experience. Place is really clean and has cool decor. Service was prompt and intuitive. The food was delicious. Make sure to leave room for dessert, the dessert menu is a picture book from their bakery. Prices were great as well!"}
{"input": "got my haircut here for the first time Jessie Becker took the damaged ends off. She's so sweet and does only what you ask of her. She's also great with kids. come see this place and come see her."}
{"input": "We love Sabrina's. Always fresh. Always good. Her soups are incredible (please make Posole more often;) We also love that we can bring our own wine without a corkage fee!  We've been both for lunch and dinner, same menu for both."}
{"input": "I love the old building and location of this place...that's about all I loved.  Our group of four were seated promptly and our server came right over to greet us, and proceeded to explain just about everything on the huge menu...must have taken five minutes.  Drinks were ordered along with salads to start.  The caprese salad had two piece of basil...come on, it's basil, can't you add some more to this?  Melon with prosciutto salad was more like dessert than salad with a sickening sweet dressing...YUK!\n\nEntrees were a range from chicken to veal to eggplant parm and all were average at best...not a lot of flavor in anything.\n\nThe server kept coming over to ask how things were...and kept coming back every five minutes.  Even the hostess came over.  Let us eat please.\n\nJust average place...won't be back."}
{"input": "The bagels were very good and the bagel and egg sandwich was delicious. Also the coffee was excellent. The people that work there were very nice and I highly recommend this place."}
{"input": "I love going to Phillies games sooo much and this stadium definitely adds to the experience. I was never a big baseball fan until about a couple of years ago, when my bf introduced me to the wonder that is the Phils- instant love. Sure,my first Phils game was the 10, 000 loss but whatever. The places has a open feeling, and never feels clausterphobic. The only time i've felt that I had bad seats was when we sat right under neath the scoreboard, and I had to keep on looking up.  I like how you can wander about and watch the game from the lower levels, and that despite it's a sold out game, it never feels cramped or you're really aching to get around the stadium. They have a lot of great food (lots of variety) and the facilities are always clean- both are numerous, so I'm never waiting in line.  I am missing baseball season and I cannot wait until April! Go Phillies!"}
{"input": "I've had a facial with Linda and it was definitely 5 stars. It was my first one ever and she was absolutely fabulous at relaxing me and I left with skin like butter. I ended up buying cleanser, moisturizer, and p50. They've been pretty decent products but smell a little mediciney and were super expensive. I've been back to buy refills on everything but the moisturizer- that one is a little too stinky for my tastes.\n\nThe only thing that brings this review down is the eyelash tinting I got there once. It took place in the middle of the salon and was very stressful. You have to sit with you eyes closed for 15 minutes which is pretty hard to do when you're sitting with so much going on around you. Also, it was really burny but I'm not sure if that's normal or not.\n\nI would definitely return for the facial but I'm going to pass on getting my eyelashes tinted there again."}
{"input": "A perfectly acceptable example of Papa John's pizza. I ordered delivery to my hotel on a Wednesday night....the guy that took my order over the phone was especially polite and helpful... He even looked up a coupon for me that helped me save some money on my large 3 topping pizza. Delivery was fast... Beat their quoted time by 10 minutes. Only reason for missing one star is because my pizza was a little smashed to one side in the box...while it made eating it a little messy, but it was still hot and tasted good."}
{"input": "Please, this place makes a semi-new menu and raised their prices. The food is very mediocre. i just started cooking and i make a couple pasta dishes which include spaghetti and lemon chicken piccatta.  As a beginner in cooking I can judge this place's food is horrible. A day after the food looked like it had been out for weeks. Good food can last for a day or two.When i went in there to eat the hostess was nice. first, we ordered a glass a wine. he poured the wine, missed the glass and some spilled on the table and he just ignored it. hello. idiot. waitressing 101. go back. well needless to say. not worth your money at all. ive been there during happy hour with girlfriends and its fine. not a 'high end' restaurant by any means even though they try to make it that way."}
{"input": "Jesse at the Bar was excellent. We got a couple of drinks with soda in them. The soda was flat. She immediately took Care of us. Excellent service in a cool pub style atmosphere."}
{"input": "Their sushi is pretty good. Mesa rolls are my fav here. They would be 4stars if they gave better estimations for pick ups. It is typical that they lag a lot and they seem to make it after you show up."}
{"input": "Great place to grab a light snack, like a specialty donut or slider, or hangout and chat over a coffee.  They do not serve alcohol, however, you can purchase a beer next door at Stein's Deli and bring it over. I had \nChunky Monkey Donut\nCheeseburger Slider\nFried Chicken Slider\nThe snacks were all very well prepared and tasty.  The cheeseburger was surprisingly juicy and the chicken Slider had a nice jalapeño kick!  Would definitely recommend for a fast casual experience."}
{"input": "I hate Delco pizza.  Sorry, but I do.  I have 4 good places and Imperial is one of them.  Pizza is on the thin side with good sauce and cheese - I like to ask for mine \"well done.\"  It's always ready to be picked up in 10 minutes!  Yes, it has a sandy bottom, but you can request yours to be without.  Nice guys who work there."}
{"input": "Overrated. This place is ok, often the crust is burned...maybe our pallets aren't sophisticated enough to appreciate that taste but it's not our thing. We enjoyed the cauliflower salad and the fried dough ball dessert is delish"}
{"input": "I absolutely love Legacy Salon and Spa. I have been going there since it was Sunday's at the Spa. Artie is an artist and has talked me into a fabulous very red asymmetrical cut that I adore! I get compliments from complete strangers all the time.  \n\nIn addition I just had my first facial with Ingrid the new aesthetician and it was a relaxing joy. I have very sensitive skin and so am very cautious when it comes to trusting others not to turn me into a blotchy mess. Ingrid used her sensitive line and talked me through everything she was doing. I don't think I've been that relaxed in a long time and my skin is positively glowing!!! I highly recommend both Artie and Ingrid as fabulous at what they do and wonderful fun people!!!"}
{"input": "I wasn't sure what to expect walking up to this place. It is in a strip mall, and they have AstroTurf on the front patio.  \nMy wife is very skeptical of places like this, but she decided to give it a try with me.  We both ordered kebabs one lamb and one chicken.  \nI lived overseas in college, and would eat authentic kebabs regularly, so I know what to expect.  \nMy wife and I shared our meals and she absolutely fell in love with kebabs! \n\nGreat place and the owner seemed genuine, I would recommend this place all day long!"}
{"input": "Overpriced and completely overwhelming.  Don't bother."}
{"input": "Zero stars for the Chicken Teriyaki Lunch Bento Box.  I have literally never seen a bento box come without rice before.  \n\nDisappoint."}
{"input": "The place is cute and the staff was very friendly. Nice menu. Good for brunch. We had lunch and were seated right away. I really enjoyed the avocado  toast and side of bacon. Nice to have another brunch place nearby."}
{"input": "I tried the hamburger via the Bartenders suggestion and it was very tasty indeed!  I wouldn't say this place was extraordinary in any aspects but it was tasty and I didn't have any service issues."}
{"input": "A big store, with an extensive, eclectic collection in all subjects and genres. Plan to spend some time here...there's so much to see."}
{"input": "I think this is one of the most OVER RATED places in StLouis.  Im sorry but your pizza isn't anything special..."}
{"input": "I love, LOVE this bar.  They have great food, excellent guest taps, and usually a great staff.  However, until the obnoxious bartender who does shots while on the job leaves, I won't be going there.  Bummer that one person's attitude can completely change the way I feel about an otherwise perfect neighborhood bar."}
{"input": "Amazing salads!  Amazing pizza!  Incredible staff!\n\nWhat's not to like? The wait can be long, and parking difficult -- but worth it.\n\nSocrates pizza is great, but the Wild Mushroom is my favorite. You do HAVE to get a salad -- they are too good to miss.\n\nOh! And the calzones are fantastic and a bargain.\n\nI have been to Deweys in Cincinatti where they started -- I am so glad they are in St. Louis too!"}
{"input": "I recommend the Philly cheesesteak. No shortage of meat or cheese, the 12 inch will fill you up and the 6 inch is a hearty snack. Enjoy it with an ice cold ginger beer from the fridge and a cookie if you can handle it. You will most likely have your food served to you by a 90 year old man named paul or something."}
{"input": "I don't even know why I'm giving this one star . I didn't even actually get to eat anything. Upon arrival we were seated promptly. As we waited for somebody to come over and offer us drinks or anything for that matter 10 minutes had passed as we got up and left without being asked one question.  Great service good job guys."}
{"input": "Our first time is our last time.  Worst margaritas we've had anywhere.  What Mexican restaurant can't make a good margarita??  Each of our meals was boring and unauthentic.  My burrito came wrapped in a piece of foil served on a plate (felt like I had hit a drive thru).   No sides...just one chicken burrito for $9.99.   When we tried to use our $3 off $15 coupon we were told we couldn't use it.  Really?  After spending almost $50 on three regular margaritas and two entrees (no appetizers and no desserts and yes it cost that much).   Extremely overpriced, poor service, boring food."}
{"input": "I love this place! If you need a GIANT sweet fix - make sure to get their Cleopatra sundae or their chocolate covered bacon. So good!\n\nIf you are a fan of beets, which I am, I advice you to get their beet salad. It is ALOT of beets and ALOt of goat cheese, but oh so good!\n\nThe only catch to it is I feel like everything is a little over priced, but I will pay a little extra for great food and wonderful service :)"}
{"input": "Very friendly clean a must for all your nail needs.  Open 6 days comfortable chairs warm towels. Don't pass this Salon up man are welcome too"}
{"input": "Much better than the one on Bell Rd. near Red Lobster. If you live in the area save yourself some time and go here. Plus there is a drive through."}
{"input": "I went in when they had 4 people working, waited for 15 minutes for my tea latte which came out as basically water. Returned it twice but gave up when the barista offered some other iced tea latte they already had instead. It was still the same - water. The baristas should REALLY REALLY learn how to make their stuff... seriously Starbucks??!!! So disappointed!!!!! :'("}
{"input": "I am a long-time client of Four Paws. Amanda is continuing the high quality of service that I received from the prior owners.  I have total confidence that my cat will be well cared for when I have to travel."}
{"input": "Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Salty's this evening.  As first time customers, it will be on our list of places to return when we make it back to town.  \n\nThey have a good kids menu, enough to keep the little ones content with options like burgers, Alfredo pasta, chicken, shrimp, quesadilla, etc.  \n\nWe started with the Crabby Dip which the whole family enjoyed but feel it was a little overpriced at $14.  For the main course I enjoyed a Salty Burger while she had the macadamia crusted grouper, both were excellent choices!  Service was spot on making this a five star experience for us!"}
{"input": "This place never sees to amaze me. The Seven course dinner menu is absolutely amazing."}
{"input": "Not a great first experience at Pastorcito. \n\nI had three tacos - two pastor and one asada, they were all very underwhelming. The pastor was bland and there was very little meat in the filling, it was mainly made up of fat. The asada was a bit better in that it wasn't just fat. But it still lacked flavor. The saving grace of this place was its salsa. The red one was petty good and if you drench your tacos it's hard to taste the crapiness underneath.\n\nTacos were 1.85, which puts is a bit more than anyone should pay for below average tacos. You can find much better tacos for 1.50 or less at many other places."}
{"input": "They have many rare fruit and vegetables, it is mind-blowing. Everyone is very friendly as well. Everything we tried was super tasty, and we tried a lots of products. Our refrigerator is full with exotic fruit and veggies, can't wait to start eating and juicing!"}
{"input": "Finally there is a place in Stl to eat sautéed seafood in  plastic bag! The sauce is a big plus. Good service."}
{"input": "Ribeye was thin and chewy. I tried it again a few months later. I spit it out. Literally. Onto my plate. Easily worst I've ever had."}
{"input": "We did enjoy the food here.\n\nI had a shrimp Po' Boy and it was very good.  The portions are a little small.  The really bad thing was that is was their crawfish boil day so most of the things on the menu weren't available to order.  I guess this is because of the crawfish boil.  The Mom of the place was pretty rude and opinionated.  The son, however, was a charming guy.  He was very nice and gave us some of the potatoes and other items to try from the crawfish boil.  We will go back sometime, I am sure."}
{"input": "Though top notch service is demanded at a JW, I was thoroughly impressed with the property, service, and staff. \n\nI only had two complaints. One was the noise level as there was an outdoor concert until 11pm. The other was the below average bartender at velocity during lunch. Nothing terrible, but lacked enthusiasm and desire to give good service. Obviously the concert wasn't the hotel's fault. The bartender issue wasn't worth dropping the rating a star. \n\nOverall, the GM of the hotel seems as though he/she has it together. Thanks to all the staff for a nice stay."}
{"input": "This is the place we have been searching for! My friend and I have tried several nail salons in Tampa and nobody could do designs and stuff like how we wanted so we found this place on Instagram and we will never go anywhere else again! We drive almost an hour to get here but it is so worth it! I have had 2 different people who both did exactly what I wanted and are extremely talented! Thank you Pamela and Steven! You all do amazing work!!!"}
{"input": "First time and I love it!  Strip steak, eggs, hash browns and rye toast.\n1 - LOVE hash browns vs home fries. Done perfectly  (I like the crispy)\n2 - strip steak. Ordered it medium rare. Next time I'm getting the NY steak bc it may be thicker.\n3 - medium over eggs.  Next time I'll do well done.\nMy first time here so I need to adjust my order temp on eggs and meat next time. \nLove the orange colored booths. The chairs are padded orange rolling chairs!\nBathroom is clean enough and big plus is there is a hook for coat and purse in there. Very nice touch. \nWe are definitely returning!!!"}
{"input": "I was blown away how organized opening day was.  They worked so hard and it was flawless.  I think other companies need to learn from them.   \n\nThere biscuits are to die for... prices are reasonable and food is really good.  Really excited we have one in Reno"}
{"input": "This hidden gem is a real treat sometimes.  I especially like the wrapped beef and the peanut butter punch smoothie.  It was kind of hot the day I went in there as the air conditioning must not have been turned on.  However, the food was good and they have a wide variety of assorted breads and desserts available and on display which make for a delicious snack."}
{"input": "Went for lunch and got the chicken gyro. Nice place, good atmosphere. Gyro was delicious, just on the small side. Served with a side and chips. Overall pleasant experience."}
{"input": "erin is great, gentle n really intune to the patient.  she is truly gifted!"}
{"input": "no way. I don't like for several reasons. Part of what i love about thrift stores (besides the catered-to-my-salary-prices) is the process. You have to work for your finds, and thusly, you feel a sense of accomplishment and connection to those goodies you find in a pile of crap. Retrospect not only takes that away, it also charges you for it. Hugely inflated prices for stuff that I could buy for half (if not less) the price around the corner at aids thrift, or up in my area at second mile. \n\nRetrospect, i give you two stars (not just one) only because you are a thrift store, and i believe in re-using goods, rather than throwing them out. Maybe you once meant well, but greed has gotten in the way of what i hope was once your larger dream of helping to save the earth one vintage print shirt at a time."}
{"input": "Great food at a great value!\nMy favorite items on the menu are the Pho, Pork Bun, Bahn Mi, and the pot stickers are delicious!The Bahn Mi comes on true French bread (I recommend the pork belly). As for Pho, I usually get the beef with extra bean sprouts. Pork Bun is my favorite menu item, it comes with vermicelli noodles, cucumber, carrots, and more. The best server there her name is Tim. Ask for her if you want to get the best service!"}
{"input": "We tried Nox for the first time during Happy Hour. They had a fairly expansive HH menu, great for those looking for a quick bite and some cocktails. The specialty cocktails are delicious and don't skip out on the Tacos, all 4 kinds are amazing.\n\nThe downside to Nox (both times we've visited) is the service. SLOW! Especially on the drinks. The second time we went we both ordered two drinks right when we sat down. It still took them 15 minutes to bring them out and it wasn't even that busy. After both drinks were gone we sat around waiting for the server to ask whether we needed anything else. Same experience the first time. The food is delicious, convinient location, and great atmosphere, I just hope they can get the staff together on the service."}
{"input": "Nigel's an awesome guy and the candy is amazing it's worth the drive!\n\nCan't believe how much all my friend love and sadly eat all my Bon bons he sells."}
{"input": "I came in for happy hour 4-7pm, I ordered the lobster-shrimp tacos & the 50 cent Louisiana Oysters. The Louisiana Oysters surprisingly were pretty large in size & they tasted really fresh. It was great service, the waiters were all very attentive. Unfortunately, they did not have the fresh fruit tart desert, so I was extremely disappointed that there were no other good options for desert."}
{"input": "Food is pretty good. Always busy. Police have to direct traffic every now and then. If you go, I recommend the Sandwich."}
{"input": "The second time came to this BBQ place. Overall, it's better than most of other BBQ places in the city but not the best. \n\nThe presentation was impressive and amazing. Everyone got surprised by the portion of their food. The brisket was tender but didn't have too much flavour. The potato in the salad was not cooked enough and still very hard and raw. The yam fries was the highlight of the dinner. The sloppy Hogg burger was too big to have everything with one bite. Even the burger lover had to either cut it into half or dissemble it. The pork meat was thick cut but dry and flavourless. The pineapple was also thick cut and grilled. But still raw inside and tasted sour. \n\nIt is a generous restaurant. That's it!"}
{"input": "Surprisingly good authentic Taiwanese food in Reno. \n\nThis place is tiny and packed with people waiting for tables. If crowds or people hovering over you while dining makes you feel uncomfy, this likely isn't the place for you.  Tables do turn pretty quickly. \n\nBoba drink was meh - syrup used and not mixed. Be sure to shake it well before stabbing in a straw. \n\nFood was great though. We had:\nBeef noodle soup - A+\nGarlic/basil chicken - A+\nBeef chow fun - B+\nPork filled pancakes - B (wished the pancake was more crispy)\nTofu and bak choi - B"}
{"input": "This place is amazing!  They make the donuts fresh with each order.  In fact, I had to wait 10 minutes for them to cool down before I could eat them.  This location is clean and never super busy.  Its a really great addition to the neighborhood and people with cars are sure to appreciate the parking lot.  Best donuts in Philly and the Delaware Valley."}
{"input": "Food and service were excellent, \n\nWe had a Country Omelette, and the Wildflower Signature Scrambled plate. \n\nThe omelet was large and truly a masterpiece, with really fresh mixed greens on the side.\n\nThe Signature Scramble was basic, but good, a little on the small side. For most people it would be just enough. \n\nThere is plenty of parking, efficient service, friendly hostess and big picture windows. \n\nThe prices! Inexpensive! Really a nice surprise.\n\nTip: They have home fried potatoes, but only on Sundays. \n\nSee the photo of the dining room I posted."}
{"input": "Chain restaurant but their menu options are good, service is great, and everything fresh."}
{"input": "Really liked the atmosphere sushi was great.  Service wasn't as attentful as we wanted on a slow day, but was alright.  Will go back again.  Anytime the sushi chef makes it look like art with small details of the knife and placement of ingredients you know it's good.  For that reason would go back!  Not a huge fan of habachi so that's not what I would go there for."}
{"input": "Great restaurant. Very cool and classy decor, a super nice waitress, and excellently prepared dishes. \n\nFood: The prix fixe menu prices were very reasonable with good choices. I especially liked the shrimp and goat cheese crepes - outrageously good. I also liked the pork chops - big, thick, fatty, and tasty. The bread pudding was delicious too. \n\nService: super attentive and polite and personable waitress. \n\nAmbiance: very cool place, beautiful decor, historic building. \n\nWould definitely return."}
{"input": "We used to come here all the time but we notice the quality of food is not the same and the prices go up we had the chicken Parmesan it was so rubbery and the pasta was hard like it wasn't boiled long enough they also got rid of the nachos which were my fav the movie screen is brightness is also very low sometimes I can't make out what's going on hopefully they can fix these simple issues on the plus side the chairs are very comfortable"}
{"input": "Probably the best meal I have ever had.  We were overwhelmed with the quality of the food.  I had a smoked fish appetizer, spinach gnocchi and pasta with artichokes, a Mediterranean white fish fillet that just melted in the mouth.  Dessert I ordered was a strawberry rhubarb cobbler.  Now, we had WAY more food than what we ordered, as the chef sends out little surprises during the dinner courses.  Three hours after arriving, we left totally sated and feeling like we had just experienced something really special.  Of course, for the price, one would expect something special, but this was far beyond special--this was a meal to remember."}
{"input": "Yah Man was yah man! Go here and enjoy the atmosphere, the personal service and delicious Caribbean fare. The beef pie was yummy as was the chicken and island sampler plates. The bread pudding was to die for. We left full and happy. If you live in the Tampa area or are visiting you should go here! Nice people! BTW, this is the 3rd time I've posted on yelp just wanted to share this place, so good!"}
{"input": "The next best thing to Prince's on the south side of Nashville. Cleaner compared to Prince's, just doesn't stay open as late."}
{"input": "Overpriced and pretentious...this outfit charges 2x the normal price for everything.  Didn't try all of the 17 restaurants, but what I did have was just average. \n\nRooms weren't even as nice as the much lower priced Hampton Inn.  \n\nCannot express how disappointed I was.  Seemed like if you just looked at something they charged you for it.  \n\nThe interior gardens were nice but really not worth it. This is Disney World for adults"}
{"input": "I have been coming here for many years - great operation and great people!  I have been to many places across the globe and this operation has the largest area to jet around in and have fun.  For the best fun, go as early in the morning as you can - just like water skiing, when the water is like glass.  Don't forget to bring your cell phone with you and take pictures - great pictures and great screen savers to remember your fun!"}
{"input": "The food was decent and they have a very nice environment. It is a nice place to have a couple of drinks, but I don't know if I would eat there again."}
{"input": "Flaming cheese was best. They were a little confused when they sat us but great and can't wait to go back for dinner!"}
{"input": "looooooooove it!!!!wut is more great than a cell phone store!especially if you live in santa barbra!And this place has a nice amount of space and is happy to get you helped!"}
{"input": "I had high hopes because of all the good reviews. It was amazingly average. The calamari was not seasoned, very plain, as was the chicken and veal parm. The bread was not warm. I did enjoy myself and the service was again, average. The prices were good. I have to go back to see if was just an off night for the chef."}
{"input": "We walked here from Napoleon and St. Charles after dinner one night. The crowd was light and the staff was very friendly. We had a scoop of Creole Cream Cheese and a scoop of Red Velvet...it was amazing. The Thai Basil Coconut was also really delicious and really refreshing. This place is great...I look forward to visiting on our next trip."}
{"input": "I took the free tour that lasted about 45 minutes. Tour guides were knowledgeable with a side of comical. I learned a whole lot of history and their processes in a short tour. If you don't want to go on the tour, it's still worth stopping by to see all of the memorabilia in the common area. The complimentary beer at the end of the tour is as fresh as you can get. Delicious!"}
{"input": "This hotel seems very nice in the lobby, but the rooms are sub-par. Ours was located on the 5th floors right next to the elevator with a very small window overlooking the court yard. It smelled like a basement. The only positive things I can say was the pillows were fantastic and the lady who came for turn down service was very sweet. \nI think this hotel needs to instill some sort of quiet hours if it wants to set themselves in the genre of classy. Having drunk frat guys making there presence know at all hours of the night is ridiculous. \nI also found out after our stay that my husband had requested a bottle of champagne to the room that was never brought. When he questioned it at check out the lady at the front desk was very rude and dismissive. \nI will never stay here again and I will recommend to my friends the same."}
{"input": "The bouncers are awful, but I would be too if I were 4-feet tall and had an infinite amount of pent-up aggression and shielded childhood memories. \n\nThis place stands for everything Reno shouldn't be. Choose LEX only if the sole alternative is being waterboarded during thanksgiving dinner."}
{"input": "The service is fast and super friendly. I love the lunch special it's definitely satisfying, im a big fan."}
{"input": "I love this restaurant. The owners are the nicest family. The food is delicious!!. My favorite is bacon pizza. I love that there is a play room for my kids to play while we wait for our food."}
{"input": "The location is cute and they were super quick with having my food ready. I got the chicken Parmesan sandwich and it tasted like a french bread pizza, so that's not great. They really missed the mark with that one. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat Cafe Roma, is what I'm saying."}
{"input": "Its ok, The parking was difficult to find a spot, and the only taco I really liked was really good with pineapple in it. They employees looked mad and rushed me through the order line I felt like they were just not happy to be there or trying to rush me, I might be going back to visit ohh and the prices weren't that great either. It was 35$ for two of us and the drinks were too sweet to even finish. I tossed mine out.  I might go on Taco Tuesday not too sure because the tacos are 1.99 each but I've seen the lines and they are crazy long"}
{"input": "Paid $18 for a poor gel manicure job. There was already a smudge when she finished and didn't even bother to correct it. Also the polish did not get enough coats applied so my nails have a soft texture to them. I will be going somewhere else and having this manicure removed."}
{"input": "The opening of The Nurturing Nest is an invaluable new resource to Reno families and moms-to-be! I take Mandy Colbert's prenatal yoga class Wednesdays and Saturdays which are the perfect balance of mind and body training for birth. Their grand opening event this weekend has helped me connect to some amazing resources I would have never found otherwise.  Nurturing Nest founders Tiffany and Rachel are kind, passionate and dedicated to helping support pre/post natal needs of families in Reno and definitely visit their website for all of the resources they provide!"}
{"input": "This has to be my new favorite Chinese restaurant.  Extremely modern decor.  Very reasonable prices specially the lunch menu during the week.  The food is great a modern twist on classic Chinese food.  I would definitely recommend if you're in the area I will be back myself."}
{"input": "I can honestly say that one of my favorite meals of all time is here.\ntonight's meal was no exception.  The chicken in puff pastry is \nalways consistent and excellent.  The chicken is so tender you \ncan cut it with a fork.  I never order anything else!  my husband\nalways orders the scallops which can be ordered as an entree if\nyou request it.  For dessert, the chocolate tart is extraordinary.\n2 slices of fudge-like pieces in a delicious sauce....rich and satisfying\nfor a chocolate lover like me.  Bread is house made, sprinkled with\nsea salt and served warm.   Their patio is large and delightful as\nwell."}
{"input": "It's big!  Very big. 50 lanes and at 5pm on a Saturday we had 48 to choose from. The food is similar to a small diner if you dare. Lanes were good am the kids enjoyed their time at the lanes."}
{"input": "Weird location...looks like somebody's house..ancient equipment just like the workers. Probably an okay place to take your great grandma for a perm real quik, creepy old guy is the receptionist and barber. Super creepy."}
{"input": "Disgusting food. We didn't like any of the items we ordered. We ordered the fried pickles and they tasted OLD. I wonder if they just reheated old fried pickles because yuck, I've never tasted such gross fried pickles before. \n\nThe burger was greasy and a mess and just all around not tasty at all. \n\nI don't normally give bad reviews, but they need to improve the quality of their food. We left without finishing our food because it was so bad, and the manager didn't charge us for it. We still left a tip though :)"}
{"input": "Love the tap room, but I can't seem to get the hours of business right.  My first visit was a kinda a let down.  I had heard that bier was the place to go for great beers in Indianapolis, but I only found 2 that I liked and only 1 was memorable.  However, bier rotates their taps weekly and does not seem to have any regular taps, I like this because it means that they are constantly challenging themselves to create a better beer.   The tap room is a lot of fun too with people constantly revolving around the taps to taste and find their favorite for the week and then relaxing and talking in the lounge area.  I only gave them 3stars this time but I look forward to improving their score after future visits."}
{"input": "This is our go-to bagel place in St. Pete. The bagels are always fresh and delicious, and my bar is set pretty high as I grew up in NY with an abundance of great bagel spots. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone and everyone looking for a great bagel; why would you go to a chain place when you could support locals, and the product is infinitely better? The only improvement could be in selection- I would love to see some whole wheat everything bagels, or multigrain styles.\n\nThey also sell doughnuts, which are good, very good, and fresh... but not great. Then again, I have been to Doughnut Plant NYC, which was basically life-changing, so again, bar set high. But it's a nice bonus when I'm picking up bagels to bring home a treat. If you're into really soft, light, yeasty doughnuts, you will like these. Husband enjoyed the red velvet cake doughnut."}
{"input": "We came in on a Sunday evening. Jordan was our server. She did an excellent job- was knowledgeable, friendly, and accommodating to our dietary preferences. The food was amazing and the entire staff could not have been nicer. This is my favorite restaurant downtown."}
{"input": "I've been to New Orleans several times but this time I was looking for a different kind of dessert type of treat aside from the go-to beignets. So I found this spot on Yelp. They had 8-10 flavors to choose from so we got 4 of them. Praline bacon, raspberry white chocolate, pineapple upside down, and cookies and milk. Praline bacon was the 1st one we tried and it was a tough act to follow! It was a flavor party where sweet, savory and yummy had me dancing. The pineapple upside donut was good. The raspberry was my least favorite. However, the cookies and milk pulled up the rear and made the wait worth it. Overall, the donuts are great and whatever batter they use for the actual donut is really tasty. I will be back for some donuts AND sliders next time."}
{"input": "Could not be more pleased with this establishment. Always clean and has a good feel, like the employees there actually enjoy their job. I didn't think I could like this place anymore and then I tried their fluff and fold service. Immaculate, absolutely perfect. All my clothes were returned perfectly folded and clean like I had just bought them. They even use environmentally friendly detergent! I'm sold! Thanks Modern Laundry now laundry is just one more quick stop on my laundry list of errands."}
{"input": "My mani pedi at Queen Nails was great! I've been to a few places in Philly since moving here in September, and this has been my favorite place thus far. Lynda was GREAT and I definitely will be back!"}
{"input": "Green eggs and ham sandwich was delicious. The biscuit was peppery and perfectly baked. We also had the ricotta toast and I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was. I highly recommend this place for an early morning breakfast spot."}
{"input": "I really liked the concept and the quality of service. Liked the sauces as well. It would have been better if the food was more authentic. Miso soup, the bean paste soup tasted more Japanese than Korean. And the rice, either it isn't Korean or wasn't cooked right. Korean rice is sticky but the rice I was served was very dry."}
{"input": "Was invited by friends while visiting the area and was pleasantly surprised!  The food was good and while loud and crowded, we still had a great time!  Very reasonably priced for seafood and would recommend to anyone upon a visit to this part of Florida for a casual, laid back meal.  it isn't my favorite spot on the beach, but I do have a sentimental spot for it in my heart."}
{"input": "So I was traveling in Santa Barbara on business when I looked in the mirror and realized that my eyebrows were *a mess.*  So, after a quick search on Yelp, I was led to Salon 19.  Yelpers did not disappointment!  The folks at Salon 19 were able to get me in quick, did an amazing job, it didn't cost an arm and a leg (a regular wax is $20) and now I can spend the rest of my business trip looking fly.  Thank you Salon 19!"}
{"input": "Best seafood place ever!  Honestly, I have never had better, fresher, juicer Lobster ever in my life.  I don't mind the long wait and the uncomfortable bar stools.  The food is more than enough to make up for it.  We generally order the largest lobster they have for the day to go with their deliciously prepared clam chowder.  It's a must-stop whenever I'm around the area."}
{"input": "First of all, the soup du jour (crawfish boil soup) is phenomenal!!!! It's like a crawfish bisque-chowder crossover. It has small chunks of potatoes with crawfish tails. I always get more than one to-go!\n\nI have also had their Wednesday special, which is white beans with fried catfish. While they were not my mama's beans, they were pretty good for a commercial establishment. You might have to add a pinch of salt or Zatarans. The fish slices were pretty small, but they were fried well with a seasoned taste. Finally, I love their corn muffins! They have tiny bits of jalapeño. \n\nOverall, the latter meal was pretty good, although I would expect bigger or more fish with the meal."}
{"input": "Great oyster happy hours that go on from 5-7pm! My boyfriend and I shared a dozen oysters and a glass of champagne. Our tab was $24 with tip. Great value! I hear they have the best to-go cups in town, and we totally missed out on that. The staff were very nice and attentive. We almost felt too casual but we felt at home! I'd definitely go back :)"}
{"input": "We had an alumni event here and I really enjoyed it. It's dimly lit, very cozy inside - it's decorated kind of like an old library. It was a great quiet,casual spot if you're looking for a low key place to have good drinks. \n\nThey have a few beers and wines, but we focused mostly on the happy hour cocktails - moscow mules, old fashioneds, etc. Everyone loved theirs, no complaints!"}
{"input": "Absolutely love this little gem! My therapist Serena goes above and beyond to make me feel relaxed and renewed. I try to go at least once a month. I recommend this spa wholeheartedly."}
{"input": "Laurel Liquor is my Go To for alcohol. I have a Mobile Bartending Service Business, Pour It Up, and I can rely on Laurel Liquors to have whatever I need, at a reasonable price, for all of my specialty cocktails. www.PourItUpMobile.com"}
{"input": "Food was well prepared and fresh. I had the oso bucco ravioli. The ravioli were definitely homemade, they were a little light on the filling which made them less flavourful then they should have been. Service was great,  the place was so loud the wait staff had a hard time hearing us unless we raised our voice. Good place. Extremely tiny and tables are jammed in. Not recommended for a date night. With so many great places to eat in this neighborhood the only thing that would bring me back is the fact it's bring your own bottle. Otherwise I know I could find something as good or better with less noise, a tad more elbow room, and more flavor"}
{"input": "New Day has definitely become my go-to location for my growlers. My running favorites are definitely Johnny Chapman and South Cider. Parking can be a little bit of a headache on the weekend and Fridays, but it's that way with anything in Fountain Square. \n\nMake sure to go on Tuesdays for half priced growler refills!"}
{"input": "Came in with my girlfriend a couple of months ago and ordered 2 drinks.  Girl ringing up my order seemed new, was running around attempting to make my coffee and asking the other barista (also at the counter) how to make the drinks we ordered AS HE CONTINUED TO MAKE HIS OWN DRINK AND TASTE TEST SYRUPS.  IT TOOK 15 minutes to make TWO DRINKS IN AN EMPTY SHOP.   The guy who sat there and stared at me as we waited never made one attempt to make my drink after I tipped 20% on the order.  Two coffees, $12.50 , 15 minute wait, empty shop.  Do the math.  This isn't the first time it has happened, staff is usually unfriendly.  I was coming in everyday and buying coffee but I got sick of spending my money with people who act like jerks.  I wrote an email to the shop and they never responded which is 100% proof they don't give a damn about bad service.  AS MUCH AS I LOVE COFFEE SHOPS I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS PLACE."}
{"input": "Went on a Monday and stood in line for an hour. Service was good and the host was amazing. That man should totally get a raise. Overall food was good, but not worth the wait. For that long I guess I was expecting amazing pancakes, but they were just some good old fashion pancakes. But I guess it's just one of those Nashville traditions you have to try once."}
{"input": "First impressions are lasting. They nailed it!  Thank you for your support of our military and first responders."}
{"input": "I've always liked this place BUT for a little awhile it went down hill. Reading yelp reviews it seemed it had gotten better so we tried it again. The owner must  have noticed the lack of \"regulars\" and stepped up their game! It is now my favorite sushi place again! welcome back!"}
{"input": "We've stayed at this Courtyard several times. The place is always very clean, the staff is friendly and helpful, and the location is convenient to shopping and interstates, but it's quiet. The food is also good, so I am sure we will be staying there again."}
{"input": "Girl's weekend in Philly! We were recommended to eat at Jones and I was sold when I was told Chicken and Waffles were on the menu. However, when I got there and took a look around I saw the chicken and waffles and decided it wasn't for me (you only get half a waffle and the chicken looked dry.. maybe I am jaded by Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles). After a night of gorging on cheesesteaks I decided to go light and ordered the bagel with lox and honey nut cherrios. The cherrios were served with fresh fruit and the presentation of both my dished were nice. My girlfriends ordered a spinach omelet,  huevos ranchero, tater tots and mac and cheese. The macaroni and cheese was to die for.. baked  thick and topped with bread crumbs. The portions were good sizes and they had fun cocktails (make your own bloody marys). The only downside was the service.. for some reason our waitress hated us. She had an attitude and lacked enthusiasm. \nOverall we loved Jones and will definitely return on our next trip!"}
{"input": "My boyfriend and I tried this deli for the first time today. I had a turkey, avocado & bacon panini and he ha a buffalo chicken wrap. We will definitely be returning. The wait for food wasn't too long, which is always appreciated during lunch hour. There was SO much to choose from. They have salads, soup, macaroni, sandwiches and hot food. I love a deli that has many options to choose from!"}
{"input": "Best Mexican spot in town delicious food and amazing service I'm from Victorville California and every time I'm in town I make sure I stop here Bistro Habanero is the BOMB !!!!"}
{"input": "Probably one of my favorite places to go. The Appetizers are amazing! Would recommend getting The Brussels Sprouts, The Fish Tacos & The Pretzels. The beer is amazing always taste so fresh, I've tried every beer they brew and not one of them I didn't like!"}
{"input": "The fisherman stew is a satisfying low calorie meal. Shrimp, scallops, mussels, and Atlantic cod swimming in a broth of diced tomatoes, sweet peppers and onion in a white wine sauce. Incredibly flavorful. So flavorful in fact that the low calorie idea went to hell as I asked the waiter for bread to sop up all that delightful sauce. Once the calorie count was forgotten, I ended the meal with a small Myers lemon tart with berries and a raspberry coulis. And a snifter of Blanton's. An extremely tasty and satisfying meal without over eating."}
{"input": "I spent a great birthday happy hour here with the usual suspects last week. Our server was attentive, fast, and funny (albeit non-intentionally). The martinis were fantastic and the oysters were fresh, fresh, fresh! But...take it to the bridge!\n\nPros:\n\nService - wonderful\nBar options - excellent\nNo waiting!\nOysters on the 1/2 shell? Tasty, tasty, with no BP aftertaste.\n\nCons:\n\nThe shucker removed perhaps 4 out of 12 of the oysters from their shell. Not the seamless experience I wanted, and it stopped me from ordering an additional dozen. I was also surprised there wasn't a different type of dipping sauce, like a mignonette offered. I'm happy to make my own cocktail sauce, but I was surprised...\nThe gumbo? For me, it was odd - all roux, with not much seafood, chicken or sausage. And, rice seemed like a practice batch of risotto was used - it was gummy and crunchy.\n\nI'm ready to go back and get more oysters, but maybe with a different shucker working...."}
{"input": "You really can't go wrong with this place. \n\nFood is great, prices are reasonable, and you get a TON of food for the price.\n\nStaff is all extremly friendly.\n\nI love comming here, breakfast or lunch, but a personally prefer it at breakfast time, especially on the weekends. The food is all cooked really well, and tastes excelent.\n\nI've been here many times of the years, and ive never once been let down. I hope they stay around a long time."}
{"input": "We wanted something spicy and fresh and that's exactly what we got. Everything we ordered was great. We have passed this place a million times and never stopped. Great customer service mixed with great food goes a long way. We will be coming back !!!!!"}
{"input": "If I based my review only on my meal, I'd have to give it one star.  But everyone else in my party of 10 enjoyed their meal, and we had a great time.  I ordered the vegetarian meal, and it was the WORST veggie meal I've ever had :(  My meal came with soup and rice, just like everyone else, but when the others got their choice of meat I got a plateful of sliced red peppers.  That's all.  Sliced red peppers.  Uh,   how about some mushrooms or zuchini or squash or about a million other veggie options.  Fortunately, I'd had enough sake bombs not to get too upset about it!"}
{"input": "Opaaaa!!!!\n\nGreat Greek food and atmosphere.  This is definitely authentic.  We got two gyro platters (great!) and a chicken souvlaki (probably even better, big chunks of chicken).  The fries were outstanding.  Didn't get a greek salad or a flaming cheese on this trip, but they looked great!\n\nHuge restaurant, well-decorated (in the eclectic, tacky Greek authenticity), and attached to an outstanding bakery.  The prices are a bit high compared to some of the other options nearby, but you can't go wrong with a meal at Hellas."}
{"input": "Romantic and cozy French restaurant. A bit pricey, but you get your money's worth with the nice portions. The escargot is highly recommended. Try and save room for dessert."}
{"input": "A year since first review and this place keeps drawing us back We bring all our friends and they come on their own too. Considering that we all live in Pennsylvania, it says something about quality, atmosphere and pricing. Yes it's noisy on Friday and Saturday, but not painfully so. Service is pleasant, efficient and accommodating. Food remains great. Chicken cacciatore, a dish I normally would not order, is fabulous here. Portions are large. Almost everyone leaves with a doggy bag and no one leaves hungry."}
{"input": "This place is awesome!!!  I agree with other reviewers on the sound system - it went out while we were there - but they have great bands and is a big part of Nashville's music scene!"}
{"input": "Food was strictly average, the service was simply terrible. There are FAR better choices to spend your hard earned dollars in south county. At least when it was sho-me's you had \"scenery\""}
{"input": "I grew up eating beef sandwiches in Chicago, and this place makes the best beef I've ever had outside of the city. \n\nCouple of suggestions: Offer a third sandwich size option (bigger!), get sweet peppers, serve fries(!!!), keep the main location off of Mass Ave open year-round, and have longer hours!"}
{"input": "Food was great. But very disappointed with the hospitality. We  entered the restaurant at 9:15 pm but was denied dine in and was told that though the  restaurant closes at 10 pm they won't let us dine in and can give only to go. They saw that there were two pregnant women and a kid with us and I explained that our home is a hour drive from there and yet they denied for no reason. I had to drive back to home and make everyone eat. Very disappointed with such attitude towards customers. Never going back here. Let them try to forgive them self for denying dining for pregnant women."}
{"input": "A disclaimer: I only had their beer, did not dine here.\n\nI think this was the best brewery we went to on a three day trip to Tucson, and coincidentally it was the busiest one. Finding a seat here took some serious time but one thing we did notice is that no matter how busy they were, the servers were always available and ready to help. There was no feeling whatsoever that we were being rushed, or couldn't get service. It was just that everyone was good at their jobs!\n\nThe NCAAle, an English Strong Ale, was glorious. Nothing like a 10oz glass of strong ale to wake you up when you get that 2:30 feeling from your sugar crash. The patio is a nice place to sit and offers a nice view of the Tucson \"skyline\" while you drink. Loved this place!"}
{"input": "Everything about our visit was fantastic - delicious food, colorful decor, and excellent service!"}
{"input": "Awesome service (ask for Amanda, resident comedian); very friendly staff.  Food was really good and beer was cold."}
{"input": "Let's be honest, this place needs a face lift. It's starting to feel shady, I wouldn't even feel comfortable taking my small children here (if I had any, which I don't). The service is mediocre and everything looks tired. The comedy club doesn't feel cheerful or fun, it just feels like the back hallway of a banquet room.\n\nGreat parking and good location though. Please owners, please put some money into this place. It really needs it."}
{"input": "If you want stunning and unique pieces of jewelry, this is the place for it! The two marvelous owners, Ali and Albisia, are such sweet people. They create amazing jewelry that you really will have a hard time choosing from! I have a necklace, two bracelets, and a ring and am already hankering for more... There's also great music to add to the decor and general ambience of the store... and you get offered wine as you peruse! What can be better than that? \n\nHope to visit Tampa again soon and see you guys soon!! :)"}
{"input": "Ordered curried chicken, teriyaki, and some eggrolls with soup...I never got that order\n\nThis was my first and last time ordering food from here. Delivery was quick, I'll give them that, but the order was wrong. When I called in they said I can have a free meal on them for the mistake.\n\nI said, okay \"I want that free meal now\" (they also offer free delivery for orders over 12.00$) my food came out to 14.87$, 18.87$ with tip.\n\n\nThey refused multiple times (like it'll make a difference if they bring it now or tomorrow, either way it was a lie to get me off the phone). I informed her that if she didn't send her delivery guy back I'll dispute the amount paid to them with my bank, and they'll lose a new customer. \n\nNormally if one thing in my order was wrong I wouldn't mind at all. It's because my entire order was Wong..."}
{"input": "It doesn't strike me as very authentic but you get a ton of (tasty) food for very little money. I ordered a Horchata and it was insanely huge, maybe 1/4 a gallon."}
{"input": "Excellent food and service. Dawson at the bar was so helpful with my wine selection and was extremely friendly. The vibe is great - large windows and beautiful modern aesthetic. Very impressed and highly recommend!"}
{"input": "I'm so happy we came upon this place randomly. They have a happy hour 3-8pm everyday:  Half off all beers, $3-$4 glasses of wine & $8 hookah! Their hookah on non-happy hour is $13. They have a wide selection of shisha flavors and even options of an ice chamber or smoking from a fruit bowl (extra charge). They do have a food menu, but I didn't try anything from it. But the plates I saw coming from the kitchen look pretty good. Overall, a really chill place to come and relax with friends. It was definitely an enjoyable experience."}
{"input": "Just visited Station 52 today for lunch and was disappointed.  Food was mediocre at best. The nachos were a joke, the salsa is not fresh, all food seems to be frozen and reheated. They display specials on a blackboard as you enter but fail to mention they are only valid at the bar. Found this out once we received the bill. My wife ordered the Greek chicken pita which comes with fries and she asked to have old bay fries instead of standard fries. We get the bill and they charged us for a basket of old bay fries and when questioned why the charge for a basket, they said the Greek Pita came with chips but we didn't even get the chips.  The waitress then says \"oh I thought you wanted to sub fries for the chips\" then why did we get charged the full amount for the basket of fries, there should have been some discount if it was a sub. The waitress completely forgot my drink refill and brought it out with the check about 10-15 minutes after she took my glass. Overall very bad experience, won't be back."}
{"input": "I hadn't really planned on stopping at Edley's because we have some pretty okay BBQ in my city and it's just not really my jam. (Hot chicken over BBQ any day of the week for me) However, we wanted a \"snack\" so we stopped in around lunchtime right before the lunch rush. We got 2 brisket tacos and the daily feature, fried green tomatoes. The food took awhile to get to us, but when it did... holy crap. It was SO GOOD! The tacos were amazing, stuffed full of juicy shredded brisket, pico de gallo, beans, fried jalapenos... maybe more stuff but they were so flavorful and amazing I could barely stand it. And the fried green tomatoes were delicious as well! It ended up being way more food than we wanted for a small snack but we ate every single bite. Well worth it! It got super busy in there and it's definitely in one of the most touristy areas but they have another location you can check out."}
{"input": "I've always had good experiences here. The food is creative and tasty and the house wines are decent. Their cocktails are well made but small. I've never had a problem with service but also haven't been here during a super busy time. The patio is a great spot to hang out with friends."}
{"input": "I stayed at this hotel last year for my first time in New Orleans and I love it! \n\nSo I decided to book here again last week when I came back and everything was again perfect!\n\nThe staffs are friendly and helpful and the rooms are clean and comfy..  I love the rooftop pool and jacuzzi.  The gym is high tech and they even have a steamed room.  The location is perfect because it far enough enough from the chaotic French quarter but close enough to walk.\n\nI will book here again next time."}
{"input": "Drinks are poured strong at the Emerald. Awesome djs spin here weekly like Mega. Ladies night is the best on Wed for cheaper then normal drinks.\n\nEvery guy dresses like their dad did in the 70s and the ladies wear tight jeans, scarves and headbands. \n\nThe bathroom was clean. Srsly the cheapest drinks in St Pete other then a redneck dive bar!"}
{"input": "Wonderful vineyard great selection of red and white wines as well as ports. Karen was a great server. Today they had live jazz. It was a nice way to spend the afternoon."}
{"input": "GO HERE NOW.\n\nI highly suggest ordering the Mie BBQ Pork.  The BBQ pork tastes just like my mom's and that's what I like most about it.   Along with the pork came some fried wontons (different than the appetizer version for its smaller size and meat portions, fyi).  The noodles have a different texture than that of regular ramen noodles, and they were definitely tasty.  This all came with a side of soup and it can either be poured into the noodles or eaten separately.  \n\nService is pretty good and quick.  The boyfriend and I arrived just when they opened for the day, but our appetizers and mie didn't take long to come out.  \n\nOn another note, parking is tough to find around these types of places.  We were lucky to find free parking right in front, but I'm sure that's not the case all of the time.  I'd say be patient in finding a parking spot because this place is worth it!  Can't wait to try the other items!"}
{"input": "So I walked up to the Cajun Grill while trying to grab something quick to go. This place reminded me of a place at the mall back home so I had an idea of the taste that would soon be tantalizing my tongue.\n\nThe price points were perfect and some locals who obviously frequent the restaurant in the food court kept singing CG's praises. Unbeknownst to them, I'd already been sold and was buying.\n\nThe bourbon chicken was extremely tasty and the portion sizes seemed like a lot when comparing to the typical amount of chicken and/or lamb over rice received at a normal NYC Halal stand.\n\nI was definitely pleased with my purchase and had a difficult time trying to limit the amount of rice I ate. Yes I ended up eating it all, against my original intent. LOL"}
{"input": "I absolutely love this spa. It is my go to place for getting waxed. They are always quick and less painful than other places. Also they offer you tea or cucumber water when you arrive. It is a very serene and enjoyable atmosphere."}
{"input": "I am frequent visitor to Ichiban, always turns out great.  Fast, friendly service, good sushi and good entrees."}
{"input": "A friend and I wanted to try something different. After driving around for a while seeing nothing but chain restaurants and burger joints, I Googled restaurants near me and Kabob House was first on the list. I am so glad that it was! The food was amazing and the atmosphere and service were great. I will definitely be returning."}
{"input": "Yum.\n\nI love to swing by Smiley's on my way home from work and pick up a vegetarian falafel platter. Their falafel is perfection! Far, far better than Couch Tomato (no surprise there since this is a Mediterranean joint). Prices are fair, food is super fresh. Their hummus is silky with just a hint of lemon. Yes, carryout can take a little while but everything is made to order so I'm happy to wait or just call ahead. Do not miss this great little place!!"}
{"input": "Really good food and a great place to take a large family. The baked fish is really good and the portions are huge. The peanut butter pie is a great desert. The waitresses are really nice and make sure you have plenty to drink. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"input": "If you are looking for a lush and lavish place to have tacos look somewhere else. Most likely that place will also be more show than quality food. Taqueria Pico De Gallo is a little place with fantastic food! Love the carmelos, carne asada tacos, and fruit! This place is always consistent unlike some other \"famous\" taco shops around town. Head down on south sixth for a quick, cheap, incredibly good bit!"}
{"input": "Best thai food in the area.  Everything was authentic and delicious.  Will definitely be back again and again."}
{"input": "This is a great locally owned, family restaurant. It is not real easy to find, but worth the effort. We went there for breakfast today, and it was wonderful. I had the eggs benedict, and my daughter had the biscuits and gravy, with a side of hash browns. The food was excellent, the service was quick, and friendly. It is a small restaurant, and fills up fast. I enjoyed my visit there. I am looking forward to trying some of their dinner entrees."}
{"input": "I've lived  a few blocks from this place for nearly three years now, and I thank Yelp for letting me know what I'm missing out on.  I went in for lunch earlier this week to try out the vegetarian hoagie... i had the veg special. It was delicious. The roll very crispy and fresh, the flavors very strong- jalepeno, cilantro, sauteed veggies, tofu, and some sort of yellow mayo that I always think is a dessert (mango pudding?) when I see it in the case.  Anyway the sandwich is delicious, and although prices are now $4 for a sandwich (up from $1.50) its still a steal for a quick lunch.  I also tried the rice and mung beans with coconut milk for dessert- delicious, an excellent way to add a little protein to a yummy dessert. Next time you're in the neighborhood I'd recommend stopping in to support this local business."}
{"input": "Our Friday night party of eight could not have had a better time. Alexa our server was very attentive. The food was spectacular. Started with the sausage and figs appetizer as well as the fried meatballs both of which were perfectly prepared. Our entrees ranged from the special stuffed veal chop (that was excellent), the always good veal parmigiana, the filet with crab meat and a very well prepared gluten free halibut. Every one enjoyed the food and atmosphere. Topped off the evening with limoncello cake and sorbeto. I look forward to returning to this special treasure in South Philly."}
{"input": "Lots of improvements to this place. Much more comfortable environment now.  The chairs could be a bit more comfortable as it'd be nice to sit through an entire football game. Otherwise, this place has really improved."}
{"input": "Some foodie friends have been talking this place up to me so I finally decided to check it out, and it was definitely worth it.\n\nThe dumplings of the day were Pork and Mung Bean, and they were decent.  The dumpling dough is perfectly chewy and excellent as far as thickness.  The filling I thought was a little under seasoned, but when I rolled it around in the Chili Oil, it was quite tasty.\n\nI also had the burger, which I thought was an unusual item to have on the menu for a noodle bar, but thought it would be interesting to try.  The burger is on more of a denser bread than a typical bun, and the mustard greens and acidic sauces worked great together.  The burger had a lot of Eastern flavors, but was still a burger, a well cooked one, at that.  Enjoyed a quick tasty lunch for 12 bucks.  As the temperatures rise this summer, I'll probably try the cold noodles and I think the ramen is calling for me this winter."}
{"input": "Came here for lunch today - sat down and got our menus - then waited and waited and waited - spent quite a bit of my lunch break from work waiting - no server! Left and went somewhere they would actually serve us. Not cool!"}
{"input": "Went there because it was featured on one of those TV food shows.  Wow.  This place is excellent.  At prime time the lines are long, outside, and wrap around the corner.  Expect to wait-Expect the wait to be worth it!  The food is delicious.  The service moves with the precision of a well-trained military unit (that's a good thing!)  Prices are fair, portions are generous.  The variety and unique items make the meal one of those things you'll talk about afterwards, you'll share your positive experience with friends and family, and you'll go back."}
{"input": "The only reason I mentioned the media or attorney was out of frustration after he would not provide the owner's contact info so I could appeal to her about keeping the area clean and cleaning or painting the columbarium.  That older area that is out of sight has been that way for years but we finally got tired of it and complained.  He never admitted it could be cleaned up.  As for the vase, I didn't demand just one for my Dad.  I stated he should replace the cheap plastic vases on ALL the niches as they were falling off and disintegrating.  There are not very many of them. I simply thought it would be the right thing to do.  \n\nIf there was empathy, I did not hear it."}
{"input": "I was hoteling nearby and was hankerin' for sum friiiiied chicken!   Did the drive thru 05.06.16 and found no reason to fault them for food or service.  Ordered the #10 box meal + add a breast.  Comes w/ drink.  The visit hit the spot and was very typical of the experience I've had at several other KFC's.  My service was fast & friendly.  Employees on point.  Ringin' the bell as I leave like at Long John Silver's.  Good job crew!"}
{"input": "Food was ok and reasonably priced. The veal Chadds Ford was good but the fried chicken tasted like (rubber) it came out of the freezer and into the deep frier. Draft beer selection was very, very limited. Bottled beer and wine selection was good but if I want a bottle of beer, I'll stay home. Now, the service was terrible!!!!  Slow, rude, and not at all interested in making your dinning experience pleasurable. Our server was more interested in hanging out at the bar than taking our order. Suggestion....shut the doors, Fire the entire staff and start over."}
{"input": "One of my favorite places in the city.  The food is great, the beer is cold and the people are awesome.  The VIP card is a great way to reward the loyal regulars and this bar has plenty of them.   Even as a smoker, I was glad they went smoke-free, it's a small space and when it got crowded, it got very smoky, but that's in the past.  They have done a lot of painting and redecorating, giving the place a nice facelift in the last year and the new(ish) menu is great.  The Chili and the wings are what I order most often.  Some of the best wings in St. Louis."}
{"input": "Came here to get away from the horrible food at the amusement park and was pleasantly surprised. Service was friendly and quick. food was tasty and homemade.\nWe got some steamed veggies to balance the plate of fried foods we ended up ordering.  If you are intending to go for taste over health than this is the place. Onion rings with horseradish sauce, hush puppies, fish and chips and kids fried shrimp were all great. Its a pub atmosphere but the service doesn't treat you like it.\nWe were there around 6 and it was quiet (until our 3 year old showed up). Very family friendly and a good break from the park."}
{"input": "Maybe this is the place to go for dinner, but apparently not for lunch!  My coworkers and I sat down to order right around 1 pm and did not get our food until 1:45!!!  Completely unacceptable, considering we only had an hour for lunch & we were the only 4 customers in the place!!!!  We immediately had to pay our bills and put our food directly into to-go boxes...which is not awesome when you order the home made fries, and they become soggy on the ride back to work.  My burger was delicious (once I got a break at the office to actually take a bite). The server was pretty unapologetic about the whole situation, and I really felt like we were a huge inconvenience for him.  If there hadn't been upbeat, Latin music playing throughout the restaurant, I would have mistaken this place for the waiting room at my gynecologist's office....no fun!"}
{"input": "No pizza ready so much for hot and now. Just told it would be a while when I asked. Don't bother if you didn't order."}
{"input": "Just had my first Panera delivery experience and it was great! The delivery was on time and the nicest delivery guy I've ever met delivered my lunch! He was friendly and polite and seemed like he was having his best day ever! Max delivered great food with a contagious smile! Good stuff Panera!"}
{"input": "Forget Cafe Du Monde, this place has faster service, and even accepts debit/credit cards. Also was a lot cleaner having less powdered sugar everywhere"}
{"input": "Stopped in here in search of a veggie-friendly brunch on New Year's Day. Disclaimer: don't try watching your weight here! This place has a laid-back coastal dive-bar vibe with greasy-spoon-diner-style dishes and a beachy twist. They're not trying to impress anyone, but serve up a satisfying meal."}
{"input": "Barro's is a great place for a couple of slices. The lunch specials are a great value for the money and there is a good variety to chose from."}
{"input": "Walked up with a group to serve 10 - parents and kids.  After trying to get someone to come to walk up window, we left because they were ignoring us 5-10 minutes and no one else was waiting for walk up service."}
{"input": "Unfortunately, I paid over $100.oo for a NYE night out at this club. It was, absolutely the worst. The bathrooms were awful and did not work. It is a 'smoking' club with zero ventilation. I literally had to walk out several times during the night to just breathe. The food was cold, soggy and unpalatable. Service was , basically, non-existent. What a waste of a New Years celebration but a fitting end to a miserable year. I will NEVER venture back here again !"}
{"input": "Came to Sierra Car Care to get an oil change. Was offered buy one get one free. Upon realizing it needed an engine flush, was quoted free oil change with their coupon for engine flush that was cheaper than the oil change. These guys were very thorough and gave me good advice on things I asked about that I know needs to be taken care of. They were very kind and helpful and not pushy or try to sell me what I don't need. I will definitely come back to them with my truck care needs."}
{"input": "Even one star is too much. Rude, slow and ignorant staff. We waited more than 45 minutes only for one scrambled egg. Finally one of the staff came and said that they could not make our order since they were so busy and apologized. However the restaurant was half-empty and quite. In the meantime, we saw customers that arrived after us but received their food and drinks earlier. Disgusting. I think this restaurant likes big orders. They put big orders in the priority. Unprofessional.\n\nI would never come back. Don't waste your time here. Try other places nearby"}
{"input": "Sweet and sour chicken and chicken chow mein were both excellent. I like the chicken cuts in the chow mein. Have also tried the sushi a few times and enjoyed it. A little pricey, but at least it's great food."}
{"input": "This place does make very good beignets and is tucked away in a nice courtyard and has live music on Bourbon St. However, it just seriously does not come even close to Cafe du Monde. It's also pricier at $4.50 for 3 beignets. The texture is just not quite the same - it's more doughy and sticky. Still delicious though"}
{"input": "I go there about every week during the summer months and they do about as good a job as any car wash in town (that is touchless). The star of the place is the vacuum cleaners....THEY REALLY DO SUCK (in a good way btw). Their crew is ok and never had a problem with them. Of course they go through a lot of different help just like most in that industry I guess. The help appears clean and usually all the vacuum cleaners work. Sometimes they are clogged but overall a good place to get a good car wash."}
{"input": "Service is slow and the food lacks any flavor whatsoever.  Plus, this is supposed to be Mexico City food and it's serving burritos and northern-style tacos.  I think not."}
{"input": "Frost is worth all 5 stars!  I had driven by Frost so many times as I play soccer frequently at Udall Park.  \nI finally made my way in and as impressed with the overal appeal of the store.  The case that they display all their selections is over the top but beautiful.  I couldn't take my eyes off of everything and wanted to try everything.  Well I stuck to my favs and had a Banana Chocolate combination and it was so good!  The kids really loved it as well. \nIts also affordable and the kids that work here are so friendly and helpful! \n\nMust go!"}
{"input": "We went around 6 and it was more packed than I expected. I knew it would be busy but I was surprised. The staff was amazing. We waited in line for about 8 minutes regardless of it being a huge line going out side. Found a table and had our food in less than five minutes. Even with the amount of people they had, it ran so smoothly. One sandwich was messed up but it was very loud in there so I don't think she heard me correctly but someone came to our table and had a new correct sandwich almost immediately. I love that they made time to go around asking if we needed refills and how the food was. So glad to have a chick fil a in Reno. They upheld the chick fil a standards even with all the chaos of opening day."}
{"input": "Probably the best food on the beaches...! Wonderful service, wonderful ambiance & GREAT foopd...!"}
{"input": "I hear good and bad about this venue, but the fact is that I love that we have a real concert house in town that affords us the ability to see a level of entertainment that normally wouldn't be stopping in Reno. I don't know as much about sound as some of the others around here, but when I go to a show I like to hear and feel it, and I always get both at the Knit. From the first show I saw there (The Roots), and the last one I made it to (Awolnation), I am always satisfied when I leave."}
{"input": "Delicious, local pizza joint that also serves excellent salads, sandwiches, and other goodies.  Fresh and yummy ingredients are most certainly used - I can tell! Small and intimate building - great beers on draft and good happy hour specials.  Parking can be tricky depending on what is going on downtown.\n\nYou need to try this place!"}
{"input": "Saddest thing about leaving New Orleans will be not going to Il Posto nearly every morning.  This place has everything I'd want from my neighborhood cafe fit with the best coffee, iced green tea with mint, bagels, caper berries and their homemade pumpkin chocolate chip delights.  The best place to go to relax after a hard week with some food and coffee.  Do yourself a favor and get one of their homemade oreo cookies."}
{"input": "Terry, I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you so much, not only for the expert craftsmanship but your patience with us through this process.  You were so incredibly receptive to any question or concern we had, ready to reel us in when needed.  I know, at times, things got a little rough with TS Colin, but you helped us keep our cool.  We could not be happier with the way our floors turned out.  We just cannot say enough and how much they exceeding our expectations.  Thank you to John and his crew.  You guys are THE BEST."}
{"input": "I had the soft shell crab BLT and it was absolutely amazing! O-M-G! I was there on a business lunch and everyone was really happy with their food. I also had the bread pudding-delish! The service was excellent too. I never wanted for anything. Contrary to someone else's review, John Besh is still involved with the restaurant because I inquired with the host. He said that the star chef would be in later that day."}
{"input": "Wow!!! This place is awesome!!! We ordered a bunch of breakfast stuff and it was all perfect! I would suggest the corned beef hash and ham. I would also suggest asking for Pam because she was super friendly and welcoming!\n\nThis place is exactly what I actually want when I go to Perkins or IHOP or Denny's, but can never get at those places. \n\nHighly recommended!!!!"}
{"input": "Wouldn't have known this place existed if it wasn't for Yelp. They make very good, authentic vietnamese banh mi sandwiches. I can get over how little they cost."}
{"input": "Be careful.  This place just wants your money, not your business.  They deal only in cash and are very reluctant to take returns.  And I'm sure that they don't only take cash only from the large contractors... probably just the little guys.  \nThey sell damaged items.  Check your stuff very well before you leave, because you will not be able to bring it back if you discover that they have slipped you the ole' damaged door!\n\nI do not recommend this place.  Don't support them.  Not at all."}
{"input": "Yum yum yum! Salads, pizza and sushi are all great! I don't even love pizza, but I love lulu's olive oil Athenian !!"}
{"input": "I was seeking out Phyllodelphia food truck and discovered this phenomenal place!! I am an average beer drinker but was with a friend with an exceptional beer IQ...and it passed her high standards! The staff was informative and knowledgeable without being stuffy or snobby. The fabulous Mindy helped us discover what we both liked best. We sampled some beers and know what we will have next time and there definitely will be many more times. Worth seeking out & finding."}
{"input": "Great food and the chips and salsa was sooo delicious I had to push it away! Ordered the skillet taco and let me tell you it was so full of flavor and meat I couldnt finish it. Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"input": "Was traveling through Tucson and came here for dinner with friends. Fun atmosphere, TV's showing Pac12 basketball - yay! Highlights of food we ordered - smoked french bread pizza (different and tasty) and cesaer salad (used whole romaine lettuce made good finger food way to eat salad). Beers on tap were good too."}
{"input": "Second time here while visiting the FIL. Wonderful food, great tasting, big portions, american flag and colors decor. Wonderful place to have breakfast, they only serve RC cola which is a nice change."}
{"input": "The service can be slow sometimes but the food is worth it. The potion sizes are great. Three rolls, app and miso soup are filling for 4 to 5 people. They have some fun mixed drinks."}
{"input": "To long of an unnecessary wait, especially when all your tables and areas are not filled."}
{"input": "I have been taking my children here for over 6 years now and have Never had a problem! When my daughters are sick it takes minutes to get a sick visit. The front desk staff are true professionals, I KNOW dealing with the public can be trying, add sick children and excited parents...well some days can be trying. But these guys are always polite! The care given by the doctors,(Dr. Carrier-Kinsley*), N.A.'s is Outstanding! As a single mom, I got a lot of irons in the fire most days, but these guys keep me on track with daily reminders about appointments, need shots etc. I also Love that I can now access my children's records, doctor's visits, etc. online. Even with the much noted growth of the office over the years, I still feel good from the individual and special care my children receive here!"}
{"input": "Stumbled across this Jem as I was riding motorcycle to Sturgis and had stopped in Reno\nAnd went for walk along the riverfront.\nHad a caprese panini and it was absolutely\nThe best sandwich I ever had.  Made it a point to stop by on my way back from Sturgis SD\nAnd was not disappointed. Caprese was excellent.  Wish this place was in the Bay Area.\nSo good will stop here anytime I'm in Reno!!!"}
{"input": "Went for Dinner at 6pm on a Friday and expect it to be packed, luckily for us, it wasn't. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is straight out of Magnolia Journal. The food was pretty dang good and drinks are too. The only reason I left off a star was the fact it took a little while to get our cocktails and our appetizer came at the same time as our food. But, they're new and I've been in hospitality before, so I get it!"}
{"input": "We went on a Sunday night and it was surprisingly un-busy and quiet.. but then the food came and nothing else mattered.  My main was fantastic, as well as everything else food.  Additionally, our server was memorably good.  He was always keeping an eye out to ensure we had everything we needed or may have wanted, without being overbearing and allowing the conversation at the table to go on uninterrupted.  Good job, chap.  The ambiance was nice; it was dark, cozy and pretty darn romantic.\n\nI almost forgot.. the drinks were fantastic too.  I can't remember the last time I ate at a nice restaurant where every aspect was spot-on.  I look forward to going again soon."}
{"input": "Amazing location, perfect weather and of course delicious beers and ciders all from Indiana! Doesn't get much better than this! I don't consider myself a brew snob and I am probably the furthest from it, however even if you don't like beer so much, there is something for you here! The early bird ticket is only $10 extra but definitely worth it as you not only get in an hour early, but a lot of the breweries that are set up have a special beer that they are only handing out at this time! I would definitely recommend ubering here rather than driving (unless you have a DD) as you definitely get your money's worth!"}
{"input": "This tour was great!  The tour guide provided us with a wealth of knowledge not only about the food, but about New Orleans history and its culture. I strongly recommend this to anyone."}
{"input": "I can't wait to go back. It's unbelievably full of everything & anything you could possibly want from an Italian market & you can eat there as well! Unfortunately it closes very early on Saturday but we didn't know & were lucky to get inside before they locked it. A lot of items were already in the process of being put away so we didn't buy very much. Couldn't even get bread or eat there. I was starving so I grabbed some cheese & ate some & of course saved the package to pay for it \n      Need a lot of time to meander around there's so much variety It's sensory overload. What we did buy was delicious"}
{"input": "The complimentary bread & muffin basket is ...TO DIE FOR!! \n-Especially for carbaholics such as myself.  \n\nThe establishment itself reminds me of a place you'd take the grandparents for lunch... meet with class/work mates for a quick bite... that's about it!  The food itself? Nothing memorable. Still I don't mind coming here for some decent eats while in the neighborhood."}
{"input": "A great way to spend a Sunday afternoon with family and friends.\nThank you Danny for taking good care of us.."}
{"input": "Truly a hidden gem. Fantastic, charming service, nice cozy atmosphere with unique and delicious home cooked food. Lots of vegetarian dishes, but we went in another direction. We started with an Ashak appetizer, an incredible lightly steamed dumpling covered with a meat, yogurt sauce.  Also tried The Bulani appetizer. It was a crunchy fried potato and onion pastry with a yogurt dip. It's a BYOB, so we brought a decent bottle of champagne and saved a lot on the bill. I ordered the Qablee Palaw which was tender marinated lamb with almonds, raisins, carrots, and rice. My wife had the lamb kabob, grilled, smoky and very tender. We finished the meal with afghan style ice cream, and baklava with two strong coffees. Perhaps the best and most affordable meal we've had in town in the last several years."}
{"input": "West Ave Grill is a  Must Go....been coming here for years and the food and service are amazing. Never a bad experience here at #WAG. The Mile High Waffle is great and always get a good omelette to share. Today I switch it up and got the Buffalo Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict over the homemade biscuits and it was amazing! Great atmosphere, home type vibe, friendly staff and management and great location to take walks after a full stomach. Looking forward to my next visit....#WAG"}
{"input": "My wife and I came here for dessert on a busy Friday night. Frost has a really big selection of Gelato flavors - maybe 20 or so - and an assortment of sorbets. My wife settled on pistachio and amaretto. Both were really good, but I think the pistachio was a bit better. \n\nWhile the flavors of gelato were quite good, I have to agree with Brenner T.'s review that says that Allegro is a better quality product than Frost. If you compare the gelato here to the same flavor at Allegro, it will lose. But Frost's strength is the variety - many more flavors than Allegro. And the gelato here is still quite good - a solid 4 stars. But I wouldn't take an Italian here looking for authentic stracciatella gelato. \n\nFrost also benefits from its location - next door to two very popular restaurants - Sauce Pizza and Wine, and Wildflower. It's a great spot for some light dessert after a meal."}
{"input": "I really like this station, and if you have to come to Philadelphia or are passing through and have the time, it is worth walking around the station and taking in the sites of the station.  It is art-decco, and apparently was refurbished in the last 10 or 15 years to its grand old form.  There is a beautiful old plaster / marble scene on the wall in a remote area of the waiting area that dates back about 100 years and was part of the original station I believe -- it is a must see and chronicles travel at the time.\n\nThe thing that really came in handy for me was that there, and was totally, but pleasantly unexpected, was the rental car companies which operate right there in the station.  You have your choice of a few different rental car companies and the cars are parked right beneath the station -- made my complicated spontaneous trip much easier once I got there.  Although getting in and out of the station with a car (rental or otherwise), is a bit of challenge especially during rush hour."}
{"input": "Yolk had the hustle and bustle that you would expect from a brunch place on a Sunday morning. The wait wasn't terribly long and we were seated relatively quickly. They have a wide variety of things on their menu that good. My favorite thing about the menu was that you could substitute a normal side for one of their sweet specialities for only $3! So I was able to get an omelet, a side of grits, and I upgraded to banana bread French toast. Overall, the food was good but it wasn't amazing. The French toast and grits were my favorite thing about the meal....for some reason the omelet just didn't do it for me. I would go back and try a few other things off the menu but I don't think it makes my list of top brunch places in Indy"}
{"input": "First time visiting this place and I liked the concept a lot. Yes, I know that healthy food can cost a lot more but it doesn't mean that the portions have to be smaller. Pros: good and tasty food, definitely not your average lunch stop. They seem to have good options for salads, bowls, soups and juices. Cons: very small portions for an average guy (might be ok for females). Ordered a bowl with protein and it comes with very little protein. I believe this is a common practice for them based on other reviews that I read. Prices are also on the high end. \n\nThe reason why I only gave this number of stars is because I believe the cons listed are quite important to me and make a big impact in my decision to go to a restaurant."}
{"input": "Big Woody's BBQ food is only matched by their service. A colleague and I (we are from Phoenix, AZ) were given Big Woody's BBQ as a recommendation and it did not disappoint. Fantastic ribs and pork steak complimented by two sides of our choice made it difficult to walk out--more like waddle out due to the large proportions. The meat flavor and tenderness has to be the reason St Louis BBQ got its reputation. Thanks so much for the terrific experience."}
{"input": "Come hungry. The food is just perfect. Fast, warm and well prepared. Service with a smile in a comfortable atmosphere.  Great music but not too loud. I had the pulled pork tacos and nachos while my family stuck with. More standard BBQ options in pulled pork sandwiches. In the end we left full and happy. They were busy but we had no trouble finding a large table. This is a must eat if your visiting the Nashville area."}
{"input": "Quick& friendly service, great portion size for the price and the pancakes I ordered were the perfect consistency."}
{"input": "Still love this place . The problem is that people think they are an solely a Chinese restaurant. They are not , the menu is huge and has Chinese,American, Italian , Mexican and more. I'm not a food Diva\nLike many who review here. My food is always tasty, warm and quickly delivery\nWhether it's kung pao chicken, a cheeseburger, or turkey."}
{"input": "I love this place! They offer a unique take on Mexican food and drinks. Try the fermented maize beer and chicharrones!"}
{"input": "P-a-R guys did a great job with our event!  All throughout the process, from planning to execution, they were attentive, helpful, flexible and focused on the guests.  Great job!"}
{"input": "By far New Orleans at it's finest. We went around lunchtime and surprisingly it was not too crowded. It was our second time to try Luke and I have to say we loved it. We love how the kitchen is open so we could see the them preparing our meal. When we sat down, our waiter greeted us instantly. My girlfriend was looking forward to the mussels, but unfortunately they didn't have any prepared for the lunchtime menu. THEY ARE A MUST TRY! Some of the best mussels in the city. Instead, my girlfriend ordered the beet salad and the fish entree and I ordered the chicken and red beans and rice. Not saying that was settling (poor us right). :) I can say as second time customers we definitely were equally as impressed as the first. It has become one of our favorite spots in the city."}
{"input": "Ordered full rack of baby backs, southern green beans, slaw, and potato salad. Ribs had a good flavor but were definitely not baby back. Southern bean, as a southern girl I have to say I've never had spicy green beans, they were awful! The potato salad was warm, we were afraid to eat it. Service was so so. One waitress was very friendly, but the other, Jess, I think her name was, omg!! She had a major attitude, like she was put out at the idea f doing her job, serving the customer!!! I would not recommend this place. I hate Sonny's, and would go there instead!"}
{"input": "Was recommended by a friend to try out this place when visitng santa barbara. The wait was worth it. Everything they had was live. Price is pretty decent for the uni. \n\nGot the clam chowder. Uni with svallop and bisq bowl. The uni was super fresh and not fishy.I would definitely come back and try other food they have when im back in santa barbara."}
{"input": "BBQ Chicken Sandwich only $5.75? Nice. Chicken was nicely grilled, your choice of topppings / sacues, pretty neat.\n\n\nGrilled sourdough, wheat bun or white bun -- quite a few options to choose from, at a great price."}
{"input": "Clean, friendly staff I never had to wait for services. I would say the pedicure I received was great, however the manicure not so much, a lot of my cuticles were still left there when all was said and done.  Eyebrow tinting was a little shaky too, very uneven!"}
{"input": "I visited Iris in the French Quarter. It's a beautiful little place. The host and the waitstaff were attentive and professional. I had pork loin wrapped in bacon, and it was very good. My dessert, which involved salted caramel ice cream, was out of this world. Overall, a sweet night out."}
{"input": "Great rich food,  but a lil bit pricey.  Everything tastes wonderful but nothing stays the same the menu is always changing.  The most unique donuts you will find."}
{"input": "I love the whole concept. We had such a great experience here. The food was delicious. Our waiter was the best. We ordered cheesecake which was even better. I can't wait to come on the day they make cinnamon rolls. We will defiantly be back."}
{"input": "As a place super close to the Piazza, it doesn't strike you as a busy place with amazing food. This place has great service, with the bartenders and servers always extremely helpful and personable. The place is even packed on week nights."}
{"input": "I was here a few times before and didn't review. I come here for the food, NOT the service. The establishment is lacking in its service. Their food is always great though! Very delicious for a dive bar."}
{"input": "A high class sushi bar, hot pot station, and if you'd like to cook your own thinly sliced ribs, the Japanese cuisine is here. I was craving buckwheat noodle and knew it was served here. A little expensive but worth every penny."}
{"input": "Yum. I love everything about these burgers...except the price. They aren't horribly expensive but they are expensive enough for me to only go if I absolutely cannot settle for anything else for lunch. I also hate how they charge $0.5 - $1.00 for every extra topping you want on it. An extra dollar for tomato and lettuce, seriously?\nBut they are really great burgers and the fries and milkshakes are amazing. The buns are delicious and they cook their juicy patties exactly how you want it.\nThe other thing I dislike is the noise level. It is really hard to hear when they call your order.\nBut I still come here for lunch simply because it is delicious."}
{"input": "The food is amazing especially the Hummus. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating was because the service was a little slow. I went on a Saturday night so it was pretty busy. They are very nice but maybe could use more help on busy nights."}
{"input": "Nice little place. Excellent service.  Pancakes were dry, omelet was good. Coffee very good.  It's average fare, but you do get a lot for your money."}
{"input": "Lucky Belly has a unique menu. They serve burgers and shakes with interesting variations, and you can add booze to your shake to make it a tasty adult beverage. They combine with this very American theme an Asian flare, serving sushi and a few appetizers such as soy garlic braised edamame, spicy tuna on top of deviled eggs, and Korean style chicken wings. I tried those three appetizers and enjoyed them. The wings were a bit overcooked, but I still liked the flavor of the sauce. The deviled eggs were my favorite, served over sliced avocado. \n\nI also tried the miso soup, which was better than the standard miso you'll find in most casual restaurants. I had the yellowtail nigiri, which tasted fresh. \n\nAll in all, I enjoyed my meal and will likely go back."}
{"input": "awesome place!!!! very dope setting large party can crash and chill....\nstaff here super nice.... i broke a glass of a beer and they hooked me one for free without even hesitation... awesome!! great place great beer \nthanks all the staff for great hospitality!!!"}
{"input": "Frank is so warm and lovely, and FUNNY! He was dead on when it came to what was currently happening in my life and helped make sense of it and some outcomes. He has such a gift and just made me feel validated in the feelings I was having. He is so in tune and has a true gift! Highly recommend!"}
{"input": "You will not find a more authentic place as this. From the decor to the food to the wait staff Mercedes parked out back. This is 100% Greek and authentic. Food is fantastic from the pita bread and hummus to the authentic Greek cuisine. While it may have touristy feel there are plenty of locals and Greek people eating here. I enjoyed every min of our experience here. There were so many choices on the menu that it was tough to choose. I had the combination along with a Greek salad. Delicious.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"input": "The most relaxing mani pedi experience I have had in Tampa Bay and what excellent service!  The pedicure massage was really expert and honestly my toes have never looked so clean.  During that time Shannon took the time to come over and welcome me to town and to the spa.  Very customer focused.  I love my shellac mani too great color choices! Slightly more than I am used to paying but totally worth it..great value..will be back."}
{"input": "I am totally infatuated with MOD!!!  Their MOD Pizza Salad is AMAZING & you pick and choose your own ingredients.  Walking distance from my place of employment, super speedy service and the BEST lemonade I have ever had!"}
{"input": "great taco's, nacho's, atmosphere and margarita's.  wednesday is triple special day."}
{"input": "Happened upon this place (visiting family from out of town) and were happy to get a quick and yummy bite before heading to meet up with family. It's a small little place with a lot of classic Italian dishes, some sandwiches and St. Louis-style pizza options. My husband and I split a sandwich and got Italian wedding soup to go with it! \n\nThe lady at the counter was super nice and friendly. Would definitely recommend stopping in! \n\nParking is in the lot and sandwiches are about $10. There are $10 lunch specials too."}
{"input": "I went to this brewery for the first time a week ago. I had the darkest beer they had and it was very good. The only complaint I had was that the inside was fairly small, but its supposed to be a brewery not a bar I guess."}
{"input": "Took the youth group out for a fun night..definitely won't return.  \n\nEverything was gross.  \nTables were unclean.  \nTold that food would be done in 30 minutes.  \nDefinitely took almost an hour.  \nBalls were nasty.\n\nSeriously.  Everything about this place is disgusting.  The chairs are all tore up. \n\nThe mini golf needs to be updated.\n\nI went up to ask about about bumpers (we were playing crazy bowl) they refused.  Said that we were too old.  I have 11-13 year olds.  The two lanes next to us had bumpers up and plenty of adults in their 30-40's but because they had 1-2 kids the were allowed to have the bumpers up. \n\nSeriously.  We will never be back.  None of the kids want to come here any more.  Swing around fun town it is.\n\nThe icing on the cake was the \"help\" at the front desk.  All 5 guys were just sitting around.  One guy checked us out but had to be a real jerk.  My husband went up to buy 7 mini golfs..one of the workers said \"you gonna pay for that?\"  Seriously?"}
{"input": "I really hate having to give Lucky Belly a 3 star, but when it comes down to a restaurant review, it's all about the FOOD.  I had my 30th birthday party here.  We had a living social deal for 2F upstairs.  I loved the privacy and karaoke! We had such a blast in our own private area. I loved the patio and string lights, where we had dinner.  Our host was amazing as well, but the food not so much.  I have never not finished a burger.  This was a first for me.  I ordered the jalapeno burger, and it was just smothered in sauce, overpowering everything.  We ordered all of the appetizers to share with our guests, and the tuna devlied eggs was the best thing I ate.  The korean wings were way too sweet and the hot chicken springs rolls was just not good, at all.  I can't say I will go back because I was so disappointed in the food. But I may go back to sing a song or two."}
{"input": "Sadly I am revoking my 5 star review of Gallagher's. I went here last night and asked for their world famous nachos. Guess what, new menu. SERIOUSLY you're going to get rid of the awesome nachos?\n\nNo more frosted beer mugs plastic cups. And they also changed the prices on pitchers. PBR now $12 instead of $9. This will not stand.\n\nI would also like to mention the place smelled like a \"radio rock festival\" or cat urine. It looks like Gallagher's is changing for their new lame clientele and they just lost a great customer."}
{"input": "Free beach parking if you can grab a spot. Bartenders are good and food as well. Great sunsets."}
{"input": "Yes it a great place and great coffee. But none of these coffee places know how to serve a decent cup of black tea.\nI should say start with the tea leaves but I'll leave that alone.\n1. The cup of tea is scalding hot\n2. The tea has a burnt taste \nSo you need to lower the temperature \nThen get to back to other things like tea leaves."}
{"input": "Can't say I would rush back as the ambiance wasn't exactly four star or higher. I'm not saying if I'm in the area and craving some sushi I wouldn't stop again. So prepare yourself for a slightly beaten up space but with pleasant help and ok food."}
{"input": "I love this place...stop whenever I can; either at this location or the Philadelphia one. I could eat the cumin style lamb every day of the week. But honestly, all of their food is good. I'm definitely a fan of their rabbit appetizer. People can argue about how authentically Sichuan it is...whatever. The only place I've actually had Sichuan food taste exactly like they serve in Sichuan Province was when I went to Chengdu. This place is well worth eating at."}
{"input": "If I could give The Eye Bar more then 5 stars I would! Stacy and Jared are so helpful. I've been wearing glasses for years and the ones they helped me pick are by far my favorite. Also to their credit my husband (who has never worn glasses) enjoyed the experience. We highly recommend the Eye Bar."}
{"input": "this place is solid.  the fleur de liis omelette makes my day.  I can also get a mocha, and kick back.  I recently took a friend here, and she thought it was slow, but hell..... she's not from the big easy... slow down is the key to enjoying life.\n\nhuge portions, and brightly lit, fast paced, slow moving, but good solid breakfast."}
{"input": "It's OK, but as someone from Texas that knows her barbecue this will not be a place that I return to. It's pricey for what it is and it's just not that great. The service was really good and the drinks are pretty awesome. But if you're looking for authentic barbecue at average/market price, this isn't it. This is more of a barbecue style of their own and it's pricey. It has a cool location, and the service is friendly and prompt."}
{"input": "Breakfast was vile, everything tasted like grease!"}
{"input": "Great place to go to for bike maintenance...took my bike in to get pedals fixed/replaced (new pedals and install fee-$20) and was in and out within 10min...the guy that worked on my bike suggested I put in some air but ended up doing it for me. Staff was friendly and courteous. The location is also super close to where I live so that's a big plus. I'll def be a returning customer."}
{"input": "As an avid knitter, I try to find a local yarn store pretty much wherever I travel. I was delighted to discover that The Quarter Stitch was walking distance from my hotel AND they had a special Mardi Gras yarn in stock. I ended up visiting the store twice while I was in NOLA, once to grab the Mardi Gras yarn and a second time because their selection was just delectable. Added bonus, the staff was amazing and super helpful. I would definitely visit this store again."}
{"input": "I reserved a full sized car. When I arrived at my scheduled time, they had none. The salesman sold me on accepting a Kia Soul, he told me it was the equivalent of full sized vehicle. When I got home, knowing nothing about this vehicle, I did some research. It is classified as a sub compact. So Enterprise took my full payment for a full sized vehicle and completely screwed me. I don't have time to go back to the rental office, so I am stuck paying full price for a sub compact, and I have to use this vehicle for a 1400 mile trip. Never again will I use this rental agency. Don't be like me, do better research and be prepared when they try to screw you over!"}
{"input": "Best Thai in STL, IMO.  I eat a lot of chicken pad Thai -- need the carbs and protein to fuel my running/weight lifting.  The portions are huge, service is friendly, prices are reasonable.  Never had a bad meal here.  I've tried several others on the Loop, none are better.  Also enjoy their spring & summer rolls, chicken satay, and dumplings.  Their peanut sauce is spot on too."}
{"input": "Haven't eaten the food here - just stopped by for the bar.\n\nI showed up here at around 1am on Saturday for a friend's birthday, and had a damn good time. The bartender was great - I ordered a long island and she warned me that they are huge and $13. When I told her I didn't want to spend that much, she wasn't offended and actually made me a modified drink with 151 that cost $8 but packed the punch of a long island. There was a $10 minimum for credit cards so the bartender gave me a beer in addition, which I gave to a friend. The tab came to $10 even - the beer was just $2 - and I was a very happy camper as I slurped down my drink.\n\nThe music was great, and I loved the tiny dance floor - it was packed and everybody was having a great time. I would come back here again for the very strong drinks and fun dancing (and I don't dance...)"}
{"input": "Was over charged when we received the bill.  The owner recommended we add an entree to one of the $25 combos to cover the three of us, Then was charged for 4 entrees instead of one combo plus an entree. She knew what she was doing.  Food was ok, not the best Ethiopian food. Some canned vegetable flavors, we all left with the bad taste of being overcharged."}
{"input": "Mark, the owner is almost always on site and is extremely helpful without falling in to  the pushy category. I'm a man that has a difficult time putting things together to make an outfit and Mark will pull a number of pants, jeans, shirts, belts, shoes, ties, sweaters, hats and even a cool scarf and tell you what works together to really \"make an outfit\". Prices are reasonable in that he often has a promotion going and I'm happy to pay for great service. 5 stars."}
{"input": "I loved berix! I went there because they had burek (also called pita - but it isn't pita bread) And they had potato burek that day! My favorite. Very nice people. All the staff was very friendly and accommodating. We were in town for a convention and accidentally over-ran the place without intending to by all showing up here without knowing everyone else also was coming. But we all wanted some Bosnian food and we knew where to go! They have other food too, but just a great place with good food. Good service - employees remained chill. Place was super clean. Bosnian (Turkish) coffee was good. Thanks berix!"}
{"input": "My parents and I took the Oak Alley and Laura Plantation tour on September 26th, 2015.  I forgot the name of our driver-he was very informative on our drive to the plantations.  The schedule is perfect!  We were dropped off where we had time before and after the tour for free time to walk around the properties.  They are very flexible with drop off locations on the return drive.  We got off near Jackson Square and got to enjoy the rest of the afternoon in the French Quarter."}
{"input": "Been here twice now.  Both times I ordered a caesar salad with chicken, and both times it was a bust.  Some of the produce was wilted, browning and bitter, and just doused in dressing beyond anything reasonable.\n\nCounter service was so-so.  First time I went in, there were two staff members taking their time.  I was third in line, and it took almost 20 minutes to walk out with my to-go order.  Second time I was in, there was literally no one behind the counter or anywhere in sight for almost 10 minutes.  \n\nNo bueno, Fresh Bar.  Thanks anyway."}
{"input": "Purchased a Groupon for the Fall Tasting menu and went here for a special occasion. Jeff was our server, and he exhibited extensive knowledge about all the ingredients, dishes, and wines. We decided a few months later to try the next season's tasting menu when they released a new Groupon...\n\nThe reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that on our second visit here for the Spring tasting, we had a different server who shorted us the petit four course. This was upsetting since we received it before and also saw the tables around us who participated in the tasting menu as well, be served them. Maybe they've removed this course for those using a Groupon?"}
{"input": "Great little upscale but not overpriced cafe. Lots of options, but needs a lox bagel sandwich. :) One of my preferred places to lunch with someone."}
{"input": "Right next to the police station in the grand old state bank building -- almost missed it. Has a hole-in-the-wall look, especially from the outside, but is actually quite deep and spacious. Quaint French cafe feel. The waiters were friendly and the beignets just right. Also had a pretty good crawfish omelette. Perfect breakfast spot. Once you get to Cafe du Monde and realize what a scam it is, be sure to come here instead!"}
{"input": "One of the best burgers I've ever had! Village Whiskey has high-quality meat, great preparation, and awesome sides -- it's my favorite burger place in downtown Philly. \n\nThe aioli and fries are delicious, too. Last time I tried truffled cauliflower; I'm not usually a huge fan of picked foods, but it was fantastic! The cauliflowers and carrots were crispy, and the juice had a light but very tasty flavor. I would definitely order it again. \n\nThe one catch: it is pretty expensive. Probably place you would go to for an especially fun or nice meal, but might not be able to afford each week. \n\nThe decor is cozy and up-scale, with small round tables surrounded by tall couches to sit on. You can hang up your coat when you enter the door, and the hostess stands behind a large wooden whiskey barrel. It's a small restaurant, so it's better for dinner with a few friends or a date than large groups. The waiters are very friendly and attentive, and service is quick. All in all, a very pleasant dining experience!"}
{"input": "I have been a fan of Charlie's for many years and I recently came back because I didn't have any jeans that fit.  I'm so happy I came back.\n\nThe girl who helped me was extremely attentive.  She pulled about 20 different pairs for me to try and explained all the nuances in the different fits and washes.  She was very patient despite my incredible indecision.  I ended up purchasing two pairs of Sebastian McCalls and I am really happy that I discovered this brand.  They are super cute and comfortable.  I love this place!"}
{"input": "I'll keep it short and sweet (oh my God, I'm hilarious).\n\nImaginative concoctions. Friendly staff. Unlimited samples. Can't rave enough about the place.\n\nI know you're trying to pick a good praline place while you're in town. This is it."}
{"input": "I appreciate Midas being open on the weekends. Also, they looked over my vehicle for a fair price and were quick about diagnosing the problem. I couldn't afford to fix it there, but eventually I was able to figure out an alternative."}
{"input": "Best Mexican we have found in Boise after looking for good Mexican food for a long time. Give it a try."}
{"input": "I LOVE this place!!  The two owners are amazing.  You can't find a better waxer in the city!  Jenne is incredible and the prices are on the money.  Brows for 12 in rittenhouse??!  I love Dana as well.  Amazing blow outs and styling, she also has a full arsenal for hair treatments.  She also does incredible Keratin treatments for an unbeatable rate.  The environment and decor of the salon is perfection.  Clean, sweet and comfortable.  They always have coffee and little treats when you walk in and sometimes even wine.  You must go.  It's philly's first blow dry and waxing bar and it's perfect cause you don't have to leave your tradition stylist to utilize them.  They don't do cuts or color.  I would recommend them to anyone."}
{"input": "Great sandwiches! They run about $5-$7 each and no they don't come with French fries but if you compare that to the average sandwich at a certain sandwich chain that claims to have 12-inch sandwiches, Javan's sandwiches at only 9 inches for the large size blow commercial chain sandwiches to smithereens. Super packed with meat, cheeses, vegetables, and whatever else you want, I've gotten the Chicken Club and the Philly Cheesesteak and both are to die for. French-fries here are great too. \n\nReally great for groups of college kids, there's a lot of space indoors and outdoors, a large TV and old school arcade games. Definitely bring cash though, like most places in IV there is a 50 cent charge on Credit/Debit cards."}
{"input": "I have only been to the brewery to pick up beer for releases. Today was my first time sitting down and grabbing a beer. The brewery makes some outstanding beers and are always looking to make an imprint on the craft beer scene in St. Louis. During the warmer, they have a great patio to sit drink and play games. \n\nIt's one of the great breweries in St. Louis so if you are around, check it out."}
{"input": "Good service at this store though I spent a little more than i wanted to going in.  I would recommend if you're looking for a higher end mattress"}
{"input": "I've dined here several times but the last two occasions we received poor service and the food was underwhelming. Very disappointing as we used to love to eat lunch here. Probably won't be back.  Not worth the money."}
{"input": "Met a friend for dinner there about 5pm, based on his recommendation.  We tried some of the craft beer - the porter was very good.  Ordered dinner, ribs and brisket combination.  The brisket was moist and held together well, but not too fatty.  The ribs were flavorful as well.  What was disappointing though, was the portion size.  My friend and I both, almost simultaneously, mentioned how small the serving size was for the price. Our server was prompt, attentive and friendly. Will I go back next time I'm in town?  Probably.  But next time I'll try lunch and a sandwich."}
{"input": "Romantic, revolutionary, eclectic, chic. I can go on. The sad part is I only came in here for dessert and drinks! You want a cocktail do ya?! Well, you've stumbled on the right place. They have more or less a book full of choices to pick from. On this night, I wanted something of the red wine variety. They have wines from all over the world. \n\nThe sommelier leaves no stones unturned in terms of finding abstract wine to bring to the table. I finished my night with a glass of port accompanied by the the pie in a jar. A splendid combo that I had to pat myself on the back for. While I'm at it, I'll pat Olio on the back too. Bravo!"}
{"input": "The Good.\n\n-There's a very decent hoagie shop.\n-I'm a sucker for high ceilings. \n-There's always places to sit. \n-It's better than Penn Station* in almost every way.\n-The bathrooms are surprisingly not that filthy. \n-Free wi/fi.\n\nThe Bad.\n\n-There are no late night food options except for McDonald's.\n-I broke my three year streak of not eating McDonald's.\n-It costs more to get a bacon, egg and cheese than it does to get a platter of eggs, bacon, homefries and toast. That's not right.\n-The place that serves fried chicken, meatloaf etc. puts all that food out on the hot plates at like 9:30 am. Which scares me. \n\nThe Ugly.\n\n-Eagles fans.\n-Phillies fans. \n-Me.\n__________\n\n*NY Penn. You couldn't pay me to get off in Newark to see what that station looks like."}
{"input": "Best mac n cheese I've had in a long time! It's called \"The Wedge\". The top was nice and crispy, the cheese to noodle ratio was on point and the flavor was just amazing. They didn't use the regular elbow macaroni though, but whatever they used was great. \n\nThe red beans and rice were good too, they came with chicken sausage. \n\nEveryone else got hamburgers and liked them. They also had a $5 drink special."}
{"input": "Great, home cooked meal. Had the lasagna. The truffle pasta chips are what will bring me back though! So delish!!!! Great service and a fun atmosphere."}
{"input": "It's really a run of the middle as far as Cuban food goes. Not bad but not great either. I work close by so I end up there for lunch quite a bit. It's definitely worth checking out for lunch as their specials change every day and prepared freshly."}
{"input": "I LOVE THIS PLACE. The instructors are great, the owner is such a sweetheart, the classes are challenging, the other students are positive and nice and I always feel comfortable there. The schedule works great for me and all the yin offered is really doing wonders for me. Did I mention I LOVE IT HERE?? Also, she does some great offers, like $30 for your first month unlimited! How can you say no to that?"}
{"input": "Update to previous review- I accidentally left the review on the wrong restaurant! So sorry! I LOVE East Coast Pizza. Best pizza I've found around town."}
{"input": "I can't believe anyone has anything bad to say about this place! Everything is amazing. Literally, like I think I've had dreams about those beer battered French fries.  I'm sad it took so long for me to discover this place. Great beer. Great food."}
{"input": "Stopped in here for dessert tonight after reading great reviews. I would have given it 4 stars except our experience dropped a star off. \nWe arrived just after 9pm and closing time is 11pm so plenty of time remaining open. The only thing was that the staff were already packing up and cleaning floors, equipment ect... \nI queried closing time as thought maybe times wrong online but he said no it's 11pm! \nI just found it uncomfortable sitting and eating whilst they clean and pack up although have 2 hours work remaining!?! \nSaying all that the ice cream was really good and a great range of flavours. The ice cream was tasty and generous servings were good although at nearly $5 for 2 scoops it's a little bit expensive."}
{"input": "Filthy's has definitely gone down hill over the past few years. It's banished it's quiet but sometimes rowdy punk rock kids and welcomed in the drunk woo girls and rowdy muscle guys. It's still okay some nights and the pint special is still awesome, but everytime I have been there lately there has either been glasses thrown or some kind of bar fight breaks out. Also their elongated bar is great but it would be MORE great if they could actually attend to people waiting at the end of the bar they decided to make longer ! But alas, it's going to be a good night at Filthy's if you see people on the dance floor here. It doesn't happen TOO often but when it does it's a great dance party!"}
{"input": "I came here because they said it was micro-brew and I'm always down to check out craft beers with friends. We got the sample order and after trying all of the beers, we each found our favorite. The beers was fantastic and our waitress was awesome. \n\nHowever I have not had the food so I can't say anything about it but after having the beer and enjoying the service then it has to be good."}
{"input": "Phenomenal food. Excellent service and outstanding center city location make this restaurant a must visit and a top choice in a city already known for outstanding restaurants. Certainly one of my favorites!"}
{"input": "Cappuccio's is by far one of the most amazing butcher shops in the city.  On my first visit, I was unsure of what to get.  I popped in shortly before the place was going to close for the day, but that didn't matter - the employees were beyond friendly and helpful.  After some discussion, I decided to go with some pork chops, which had to be cut.  No problem, the staff was willing to cut the chops to the thickness of my liking.  And man, were they some of the best pork chops we've ever had.\n\nI had such a great experience that I went back 2 days later, this time with my husband, a lover of all things meaty.  We were again greeted and helped by the exceptional staff.  The experience you will have at Cappuccio's is worth the trip alone, but their meats are also exceptional.  I think we've found our local butcher shop."}
{"input": "See's candies is California base bakery reach Florida. I know about this candies when my wife living in California. Their chocolate is very soft and tasty. \n\nIn Tampa, the International Plaza Mall has this temporary store from Thanksgiving to Easter. They located very close to H&M clothing store. You can have samples before you buy it. I got the lollipop candies. I also bought one assorted chocolate candies. They are very good. The store clerk was kind enough to let us try their assorted chocolate other their typical sample candies. \n\nYou can go with chocolate with nut, mint, toffee, milk, white or dark chocolate. All are good. Guilty pleasure with a touch at sweet side. Mail order through the web also available. If you close to the mall, just go to buy one without shipping."}
{"input": "Wawa is like a beacon in a cold, dark world.  I grew up around Sheetz locations, but I have to admit that I prefer Wawa.  The sandwiches are really good, and they have the typical snacks/drinks you would expect from a convenience store.  This particular location is not quite as friendly as the one I go to near the office, but whatever.  I can still walk out with all of my snacking requirements."}
{"input": "Wonderful gel manicure. I recently went to a salon that applied acrylics and gel way too thick, and eden nails completely fixed and cleaned them up for me. The staff is very friendly and talkative. My only complaint is a slight space of nail was left between the cuticle and the polish.\n\nOverall I will be making this place my go-to salon. Note that tips must be paid in cash."}
{"input": "Got the apple and bacon pizza. It was really delicious, but the toppings slid off the pizza really easy, so you had to hold it really well to avoid that. The outdoor seating was very nice and the heaters worked well. The waitress seemed a little annoyed, but it was not a big problem. There was no wait on a Sunday night, so we were seated very quickly. Overall a nice experience."}
{"input": "This a lovely restaurant! It sits in a whimsical setting and its home feel makes it very welcoming. I love this over any big chain restaurant. Service was great. Their grapefruit margarita was just right and the appetizers were right on. My favorite was the chicken bacon flatbread. The dough was fresh and the right consistency. The artichoke spinach dip was yummy too, but it was the chips that added the right touch. The hubby loved the calamari. To top it all off we received a loyalty card! Love that!"}
{"input": "Easy in and out, tellers are great. Generally, don't have a problem with them talking endlessly to customers while there is a line. But sometimes the customer is not prepared or they want attention and they try to stand there and chat even when there are people waiting to do business. Lori is great and I enjoy doing business with her. She has been excellent in helping me close my mothers estate account. She gets MORE than FIVE STARS.\nBut be aware that most things other than taking money our or putting money in the bank require an appointment. Many times I have walked in thinking it was something simple just to find out I need and appointment and appointments get double booked."}
{"input": "Went to get started and Drew provided all the info I needed and more.  Big selection, everything you need, easy 5 star"}
{"input": "Tried this place for the first time today food is outstanding. Service was great as well. I will definitely be back."}
{"input": "A friend of mine was guest bartending one evening, so I decided to give PH a shot. All drinks were half price (hell yes)! I think the appetizers were cheaper also, but I vaguely remember eating the hummus since I was pretty drunk. The atmosphere wasn't my usual, but it was cool mingling with Philly's 9-5er's."}
{"input": "Hidden gem! We had a day out without any children, and went here. \nThe bartender was super knowledgeable about their beers and offered samples for free. She took great care of us although she was really busy with a full bar. \n\nWe ordered the chicken wings and they were delicious.  I was very impressed with our experience."}
{"input": "I stopped by Veekoo on my way to the Outlets. Nice Asian fusion restaurant. The sushi was unexpectedly good and is made fresh to order. The sushi bar is separate from the regular dining area. The menu is a mix of Chinese and Thai, in addition to the Japanese. The soft shell crabs were delicious considering they're not really in season. Service was excellent! In this neck of the woods I wouldn't expect to find a better Asian fusion restaurant."}
{"input": "As others are writing, the atmosphere is great.  I'm surprised this has as high a rating as it does.   Probably because many are only drinking.  The service was extremely slow on a pretty empty early evening week night.  (5:30).   Food was mediocre at best.  Several people in our party feels it was all microwaved.  And to have $$ for the menu price is deceiving.  Most everyone in our party thought it was way too pricey.   We are quasi-local and will find another place next time.  Ps.  Waitress was very pleasant."}
{"input": "I feel like such a snot complaining about a Starbucks. The staff here is great. My issue here is the guests. There are a couple people that live here. So if you were planning on sitting in one of the cozy chairs think again. They've basically claimed them as their own. Take a close look and you can see their ass prints in each seat. Seriously. And on a nice afternoon there's usually 5-10 too many highschoolers hanging around. They tend to sit outside around the Cold Stone next door which is a little bit of a relief. Where do these kids get money for Starbucks everyday? I was counting change to share a $1 slice at the local pizzeria! But otherwise, drinks made right- every time- also friendly and quick drive-thru."}
{"input": "This Nail salon is awesome!!! I made an appointment for me and a friend. The entire time we were getting our nails done, we were the only customers, which was great. They do accept walk ins, but the gentlemen suggested to always make an appointment.  The gentlemen who did my nails was excellent, he took his time, he was very patient, and paid attention to detail.  The women who did my friends nails, did a good job as well. My friends nails looked great. The salon has free wifi, I was offered water, and the gentlemen offered to put a movie on. I will definitely be coming back, and I would recommend this salon. !"}
{"input": "Kick ass Indian food at a reasonable price. I haven't had anything from there that didn't taste awesome."}
{"input": "Property looks good from the outside, but seems run-down on the inside. Room seemed worn and although it was roomy, there were several things not working (ice maker, dishwasher). Not what I had expected having stayed at this brand property in other cities. Won't return."}
{"input": "This place does a great job with its spices.  The basil chicken is flavorful and I love the mix of veggies - peppers, onions and mushrooms.  The panang curry is also food, although they serve it on blanched cabbage and I'd rather they use a few other cooked vegetables.  The chicken satay is tasty.  The tom yum is mediocre.  The fried tofu is a bit rubbery.  There are limited thai restaurants in Nashville but this place is unassuming and service is attentive.  I really do like the flavor profiles here just wished some of the ingredients were a little more thoughtful.  In my opinion, the basil chicken is quite good - the elements fresh and at spice level 2 its just the perfect meal. The four stars is really for that dish and just enjoying it satisfies my craving for thai food."}
{"input": "As a double date with a good long lost friend for a relaxing evening dinner, we were surprised in early august to not get reservations until 8. \nSo we arrived an hour early and had drinks in the lobby while the piano man played beautifully. The bartender was a bit slow at first but kept us well tended. \nOur table in the corner against the glass was ready early and we enjoyed watching the rays chase fish around the bay as the sun set.  \nI started with the tasty crab and corn chowder but was a bit disappointed with al dente potatoes in the bowl. \nWife ordered the scallops which were superb as was my crab stuffed grouper. But my rice was also inadequately cooked. \nCreve brûlée was excellent as was Tim's attentive service. \nWorth going again, but they need to get all the parts of the dishes correct to get 5 stars."}
{"input": "I usually drop by here after a workout at Maryland Farms YMCA.  It's your typical Chipotle. Service is Alway great and food is Always fresh.  Also they are not stingy with the meat like some other chipotles.  Not to sound like a meathead but nothing is worse than getting a half ass scoop of meat at Chipotle."}
{"input": "I have had several business dealings with Advanced Appliance Services and they've all been wonderful. They have repaired my refrigerator, my microwave, and my cooktop. Every time it has been a wonderful experience and I can't recommend them highly enough!"}
{"input": "This is the best Mexican in St. Louis. The service is always so great and the food is authentic and fast!"}
{"input": "I love Mint! I've only ever had good meals here. Fairly priced, delicious food, good vegetarian options."}
{"input": "I cant say enough good things about brunch here. Feels like a home cooked meal in a super relaxed and great environment. Awesome drinks.the bartender siana is so good at her job and she's always smiling. I dont know what the managers name was but he was really tall and super friendly. He made sure my friends food was free of gluten and personally brought the food to us. We will be back!"}
{"input": "Excellent service!! Great happy hour deal!! I only tried the chips and guacamole this time, but I will be back to try more. Fresh and delicious food."}
{"input": "Fantastic service and the food also great, simple, tasty and well priced."}
{"input": "Yeah I'll go 5 stars. Great little shop. Nice employees who don't roll their eyes when you ask for many many samples. I only got 2, but I really just wanted to keep going. \n\nLots of great flavors and ideas going on here. The salted caramel is just out of this world. It's haunting me right now. It is a tad bit salty and should definitely not be eaten out of a pretzel cone but it's so freaking good. I got some peach bellini sorbet that was packed with flavor and so delightfully smooth. \n\nPrices are pretty reasonable. Go here."}
{"input": "Best veggie Muffaletta. Eggplant fries were amazing. Table service was fine. Hostess stand was fickle and it wasn't Mary. There were two four-tops, but they refused to seat us because we were three."}
{"input": "Great restaurant and well worth the price. I went to this restaurant for the lunch buffet, which was $11, and the food did not disappoint. The menu is quite extensive. The hibachi was great, sushi was good, and their nigiri was better than many other sushi restaurants I've been to. My favorite roll was the Saki roll."}
{"input": "I had a lemon corn cake for lunch and it was delicious. I didn't realize I was basically ordering dessert for lunch, but I don't regret it. The service was good too! I would be happy to return."}
{"input": "Perfect for breakfast.  I can't vouch for any other meals.  But I go out to breakfast a lot, and this place by far gives you the most food for your $$.  So many places, it's extra for meat, etc., not here -- one price -- more food than you can eat.  The eggs are cooked perfectly.  The French toast is delicious, and omelettes are enormous.  They also have fresh squeezed OJ - win.  \n\nQuick, friendly service.  Vibrant atmosphere, albeit a bit older....\n\nIt gets crowded on the wknds especially, but you can sit at any of the tables by the bar w/o having to wait..but place is huge and turnover rate is fast, so waiting isn't usually long."}
{"input": "Ordered takeout so this review is for that. Tried the P&K Cheeseburger and it was fantastic. Highly recommend it to anyone visiting or ordering from it. Someone else tried the Lancaster Chicken and loved it."}
{"input": "I regularly go to student salons for hair cuts and styling. \n\nI have long, fine, mostly straight Asian hair, and have had mixed results from the Aveda Institute -- to be expected considering I had a different stylist in every case.\n\nJust know that if you haven't had a student stylist before, don't expect perfection. Do expect the cut to take an inordinately long time compared to a seasoned professional -- most of my cuts/styles have taken around 2 hours. The basic cut price includes massaging wash, cut, and blowdry style, plus the stylists do take the time to check in with their teachers and make sure the cut is going the way you want it to. Another plus: all of the stylists I've had at the Aveda Institute have been professional and committed to their service, which isn't always the case at other schools. And the prices are right."}
{"input": "Enjoyable ballpark with excellent food and good view of the field from most anywhere. They have a history of baseball in Philly exhibit by the bullpen that is worth checking out. Only downside is you're amongst the annoying Philly fans, go Nats!"}
{"input": "We reserved a room with a king size bed.  When we arrived we were told they were all gone and had to get a room with 2 doubles (not even a room with a single queen). This was upsetting since in my book the whole purpose of a reservation is to get what you paid for. \n\nOnce we settled for the 2 doubles the guest services told us a lot about activities and local food. \n\nThe room was in great shape and clean. I am giving 3 stars for the reservation issue.  I was going to give lower but guest services had great services and even though there is an issue with the beds it is a nice room."}
{"input": "ZERO STARS!! This place is dirty and disorganized.  There were yellowed OLD newspapers piled on top of a dusty fake tree in the waiting area.  Jenna did my nails so poorly I had to return TWO times in one week for repairs while she scolded and argued with me the whole time. \n I see no FUTURE for this place or in MY FUTURE.  Don't waste your time or money. This is the Lehigh Acres location."}
{"input": "Good food  cashier Alessandra very polite and respectful . meal box was reasonable for the price \nAnd it  tasted good as well I will come back if in the area"}
{"input": "How have I never given a review to what's got to be my FAVORITE pizza joint in town?! I've been coming here for delicious pizza since I was a kiddo, and while the owners may have changed, the pizza hasn't. This pizza is a thinner crust than other pizzas, and their chicken wings are just what chicken wings should be: tossed in delicious sauce (mild, medium or hot) and not too crunchy. They have all the favorite pizza: pepperoni, combo, Hawaiian...this is not a fancy place, but it's a place where you'll get some good food. The guys that run it now are all Hispanic, and they have kept this place as good as the previous owners. We come here often enough that they recognize our order (medium 1/2 pepperoni 1/2 veggie with Canadian bacon, 1 pound of mild chicken wings and an order of garlic bread) every time. I plan on continuing to frequent this place for a long time."}
{"input": "This restaurant is absolutely delicious. Their  parfait is yummy,it's a pretty decent size and it's actually filling by it's self. Their french toast is amazing! To top it off, the mimosa was perfect."}
{"input": "Upon arriving we decided that we might be better off to order at the takeout window and sit at nearby picnic tables on the pier. This is a great option if the line happens to be long. The location is lovely and offers traditional seafood options. The crab cakes are AMAZING!!! Like maybe the best I have ever had and the staff was so friendly and helpful. Really great."}
{"input": "High Velocity lounge was great.  Went their for a beer tapping during GenCon and it was a blast.  Great place to grab a drink before or after an Indians game.  The facility was excellent and the staff are top notch."}
{"input": "some days i want tacos\nso when i visit this place i was happy\n'caus it was cheap and tasty"}
{"input": "I've used their copying services many times. Although a bit pricey, they can't be beat for convenience. I love being able to e-mail them jobs and then pick them up within a few hours or the next day.\n\nThe last time I was in the store to pick up my order 2 different staff members asked if I needed anything. This was a pleasant surprise from being ignored in so many stores."}
{"input": "My go-to spot on a Saturday night! I was real bummed that lucys closed, but was pleasantly surprised by this bar just across the street!\nTheir food is better than expected. I always get wings and fries. (be careful of the wtf sauce though) Sometimes it takes a real long time to get the bartenders attention, but the place is usually packed. And if you're lucky the always sunny crew will pop in!"}
{"input": "Ordered the shrimp skewers, they were garlicky and delicious. The chili was spicy and good. I saved the best for last, the turkey club was the absolute best that I've ever eaten. The wait staff was friendly and quick. Put this place on your to do list."}
{"input": "oh.  my.  god.  i went here for south street's \"restaurant week\" (3 courses, 30$) last weekend and it was amazing.  And that should say a lot considering that a lot of restaurants use restaurant weeks to half-assedly  crank out dishes for the masses in an assembly-line manner.  \n\nBut not here.\n\nevery dish was excellent, and even artistic!  I had the avocado ceviche, barbacoa (perfectly cooked), and chocolate souffle cake with cajeta ice cream.  We also ordered the custom-made guacomole for the table; a server came out and made it for us right at the table. And just as swiftly as he had made it, the four of us devoured it.  SO good.  And the waitress was super-attentive and more than willing to offer recommendations.\n\nOn top of everything, the place has a very cool atmosphere and is on a stretch of south street which is very pretty, especially on a temperate spring/summer night--perfect for a little post-dinner stroll or if you're en route to some bar hopping later.\n\nTry this place--you won't regret it."}
{"input": "Did a Garden District Walking Tour with Val. He was very knowledgeable & patient. Because he lived in the neighborhood, we got into places we probably wouldn't have with another guide. Highly recommend."}
{"input": "WORST location  out there. I eat Chipotle 4+ times a week, and every time I go to this location I have a terrible experience.  Today, my burrito (with almost no meat put in) tortilla fell apart while trying to wrap it. He then tried to rewrap it and failed.  It came apart again on the third try... as well as the fourth.  When the fifth tortilla broke in three different spots, he still wrapped and gave it to me.  Also, have the ingredients were stuck to the previous tortilla tries.  Like I said, I eat Chipotle 4-5 times a week, but I'll be going to Qdoba after this."}
{"input": "Me and my husband love this place!! They are always so nice and the food is amazing!\nMy favorite thing on the menu is chicken tikka masala with garlic naan.\nSo good and reasonably priced. \nThey will also make it really spicy like we like.\nWe have brought many friends and family here and they also enjoy it."}
{"input": "I just got C & B's via Order Up Delivery Svc and what a perfect wintry in home dinner. I ordered the Swanky Frank w/ fries and completely enjoyed my loaded up frank. The fries had a little seasoning on them which added a nice touch. I also ordered a lg bowl of beef chili just because I had to have some chili from a chili house. It was nicely pkg'd and I plan on having a late night snack w/some chili later. I requested the sour cream and crackers on the side for warming. I would 100% suggest using Order Up for some cozy chili at home this winter!"}
{"input": "Tried the pulled pork, green beans, Mac n cheese and cornbread. It was all pretty mediocre barbecue. Not bad, not great. The pork was a little overdone/dry, but had a nice smoky flavor. The original bbq sauce is pretty sweet/syrupy. Ill probably go back, but I wouldn't if there was a better option as close to my house."}
{"input": "I wish there were one closer to the L.A area!! There is all kinds of different jewelry. Sure its not the most well made but i was extremely happy with the cute earnings i purchased. I should have bought some more!"}
{"input": "Solid burger.  Especially from a chain.  Smash fries are great.   Hagen Daz milk shakes.  Yes please"}
{"input": "Ordered the pad Thai and was pleasantly surprised by how good it was.  The sushi seemed a little pricey for the quality I got but overall good experience"}
{"input": "I'm very displeased with my experience here the girl up front was very rude when I went up to the bar to get some drinks I was not carded when my friends who are african American went up right after me they were carded which they were already carded up front so I don't understand why they were carded twice and I was only once I think that was very racist of them the workers there just make you feel uncomfortable for being there i had such high hopes for this place I am so let down I will not be returning"}
{"input": "Good beer selection, knowledgeable staff. Had I not ordered food here it would have an enjoyable experience. Some how received undercooked inedible Fries, one well done burger and one burger medium rare.... both burgers were served on buns that felt straight out of the refrigerator, slightly hard and cold. If you're drunk the foods good, don't eat it sober, plus add in service that was lackluster at best. We couldn't even eat the food and left it untouched. We told the the bartender no we didn't want it and what was wrong with it. Charged us full price."}
{"input": "They've got by far my favorite tacos in East Nashville. Definitely go for the chorizo tacos and ask for green sauce. \nI call ahead and takeout is always quick and the staff is really friendly. They've become a staple of my weekly diet since they opened up. I'm also a fan of the fajita quesadillas."}
{"input": "I went here for the first time the other day after a yelp search and wad pleasantly surprised. As others have said the fact that it's on a strip mall near the dollar store is deceiving. This place was great! I think, Joe, was the one that did my nails and I was very happy with my nails. This establishment is quite large and I sat right down as a walk in. Everyone was very friendly. I don't have anything bad to say about this place. For a mid price nail salon it was fantastic."}
{"input": "1000% my favorite hidden Italian restaurant in de. The portions are humungo and the prices won't leave you running to the ATM for some extra $. Food is delicious, seating is always available immediately and it's a great spot for a group dinner."}
{"input": "They have a drive through! Super convenient for my quick stop to bring some beignets back to Houston. Order came out hot & fresh pretty quickly. I got the powdered sugar in a separate bag so it wouldn't melt and wow they're not stingy! I had so much powdered sugar my little brother double dipped/tripled dip drowning out each bite. My family loved it, thumbs up! \n\nFrozen coffee gave me enough energy for my long drive back to Houston and kept cold for hours!"}
{"input": "If you're a fan of sweets, this spot is worth visiting.  They're well-known for their pralines, but there are plenty of other desserts to choose from here.  They even have guys in the front (or back?) of the store making pralines that you can watch."}
{"input": "I enjoyed their Chorizo Omelette its nice to find a place around here that server Mexican Chorizo so that excited me.  The restaurant  was fairly priced and the food was average. I would have given them 3 stars based off of that but where they make up for ok food they give you HUGE portions.  My daughter had a kids Hamburger that was the same size as the burgers off the regular menu, my omerette was half the size of the plate. My wifes French Dip was missing a horseradish sauce and ended up being just a typical roast beef , the au jus was pre-made so that was disappointing. Im really interested to try some of their other dishes to try and see where they excel. We will definitely be going back"}
{"input": "Place has really slipped as far as food quality. Pork steak was dry and tough and I wish they'd have let me pick which sauce from the squeeze bottles on the table. The BBQ nachos we'd shared here before many times was soggy and tasteless. We were there early evening Saturday and they weren't busy at all.  I guess words gotten around. \n\nStill good service like before.\n\nProbably not returning."}
{"input": "Hotel was clean and comfortable. We had a very spacious room. The hotel staff was wonderful and friendly. Stanley and Danielle you two rock!"}
{"input": "I scheduled an appointment and was told someone would be out bw 9 and 12. No one showed up. When i called to inquire when some would arrive (2:30pm), i was told my order slip never printed and no one would come out today. Would i like to reschedule for Monday. Very disappointing when you take off from work and waste your entire day."}
{"input": "I got the chicken waffles it was very delious and flavorful. They should expand their breakfast menu because some items you had to get separately causing the price to increase a lot."}
{"input": "Can't go wrong with some Todd Cobell!"}
{"input": "Saw \"A Christmas Carol\" a few days ago and loved it.  It was the first time I'd visited the IRT since living in Indy in the 70s and part of the 80s.  I'm not much for holiday spectacle-type shows, but the superb cast and great use of the stage was a pleasure. The performance was surprisingly first-rate both in acting and production quality.  I've been told IRT is one of Indy's premiere performing venues and is an equity theater, so you should expect a certain \"polish.\"  I was a little disappointed with the theater interiors themselves: architects did a hack job of \"adaptive reuse\" during the 1980 remodeling to what used to be an old vaudeville and cinema palace."}
{"input": "Went here twice over last weekend.  The first time I was not too impressed by the food quality but the beer was very good according to everyone that drank it.  \n\nHowever the second time they let us host a wedding toast after a friend's wedding at the river walk.  These guys are really nice and were unbelievably generous with their space.  They let us bring in our own champagne and cupcakes to setup for the after party of our friends nuptials.  We agreed that people would still order off the menu but what a great group of guys for helping us out after we needed a space and the bar manager at the Silver Legacy cancelled on us at the last minute."}
{"input": "Zimmer's Seafood, located at an underdeveloped pedestrian friendly intersection in the heart of Voscoville, prepares arguably the best dressed shrimp po-boy in town (Castnet's are very good as well). You pay for quality here as Zimmer's is not the cheapest but we want real shrimp not the dried bite sized variety right? Of course. My only gripe is that they are closed on Sundays in opposition to my stomach's occasional Sunday po-boy craving. Check it out!"}
{"input": "Delicious ice cream with topping. Fudge and raspberry toppings are great. We'll definitely come back here in the future. There are still a lot of things to try. They only don't have espresso coffee."}
{"input": "I know they're all the same chain but I wasn't particularly crazy about this one. The quality wasn't as good as the one we visited in Orlando. The pina colada twirl didnt look and taste the same and wasn't as creamy as the one we tried in Orlando. Instead of the flavor bursts they mixed the flavor in."}
{"input": "I have been going to this nail salon for years off and on. I came here back when it was called Tropical Nails and Tom was the owner. Now its Grant Nails and has a different owner. When I started getting my nails done again I lucked out and found an experienced technician named Amy. I stuck with her because she did good nails. Then about 2 months ago Amy left. So I let the owner Angela do my nails. The first time was ok. Then the second time she did them the gel polish (which she talked me into getting instead of regular polish) started to chip within a day. I called and complained, she redid the polish and again within one or two days it was chipping. Now my nails look at mess. I don't trust her to correct the problem. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to find a new nail place. Very upsetting and disappointing."}
{"input": "My first time visiting this place. I was told it's been here for about 2 yrs. I walked in and was greeted promptly. Truck took care of me. She gave me a very nice mani/pedi. I asked for French Pedi with thin white line. She was excellent! Usually salons apply too thick of a line and have to remove half of it. Truc's smile & pleasant attitude was a welcomed sight. Very lovely person. The facility is easy to find. Just off Veterans on Transcontinental. The massage/spa chairs were comfy, there was not that strong chemical smell which I hate! Gives me an instant headache. There were plenty of polish colors to choose from, well staffed and moderately priced. I would definitely return the next time I'm in town!"}
{"input": "I've been coming here since I was a kid. Always great. Stopped by for lunch and was totally ignored. While I was not in her station Sue took it upon herself to assist me and got my drink order. The waitress I was supposed to have finally came over and asked me what I wanted. I told her I was already being helped and Sue finished the service. I was just about to leave when Sue approached me. Thank you Sue. Now I still have great feelings about this wonderful Florida institution that is Ted Peters."}
{"input": "240 Studio, the owner Michelle Lee, and all the staff are super supportive and truly provide a professional as well as inspiring and creative place to work. The light is fantastic, and the vibe energizing. It's the perfect place for me to work and create!"}
{"input": "My parents and I ate here Saturday night. The fish was very fresh. I got salmon, yellowtail, okra, and eel. And mom got the Korean BBQ ribs which she loved. The service was speedy and attentive. Great spot for sushi! I'll definitely be back."}
{"input": "Such great food! The chef was creative and innovative, while still staying true to traditional Hispanic/Latino cuisines. The yuca fries were crispy and delicious, the empanadas were great, and the skirt steak w/ polenta was seriously the best thing I've eaten in a while. My sister is a vegetarian and often has a hard time finding good options when we go out, so she was delighted to see a variety of great choices (the mushroom empanadas were her favorite!). \n\nThe service was really great--the waiter was really helpful in helping us pick out beers/cocktails (try the sangria!). Great restaurant!"}
{"input": "One of the Best Coffee shops in town! They have a variety of non-dairy milk options and the cashier seemed very knowledgeable about the different types of coffee they offered and suggested a few of their house made syrups to add to my latte. I went with the almond maple syrup and oat milk, it tasted Amazing! I topped off my order with a vegan muffin that tasted just as good as the coffee. Thank you for offering vegan options! I will be back!"}
{"input": "We had the best time at this little find. We walked right up and felt at home. Everyone was so nice & friendly. \nThe food is typical bar food & nothing to rave about. It's the atmosphere that is what makes this place. \nIt was hopping due to the seafood festival on the same weekend but the staff acted like it was a normal crowd."}
{"input": "Renovation of the historic building was thoughtful and well executed. Food was great...service was excellent. Everyone in the party was impressed and will return."}
{"input": "First time here tonight. We got a salted caramel cupcake, a mocha chocolate chip cupcake, and a peanut butter pudding. The cupcakes were moist,  the frosting was so silky and creamy, so good. But the star of the show was the peanut butter pudding. Holy crow.  Never had anything like it before.  It was more of a creamy,whipped, mousse like pudding. The peanut butter flavor was not too sitting strong or overwhelming like peanut butter can be.  Throughout was some of her peanut butter cookies.  So soft,  it mixed wth the pudding like perfection. We live in nj but we will absolutely be back!"}
{"input": "The food here is just okay.  The crawfish etouffee was on the small side and not very flavorful.  The puff pastry wasn't as flaky and light as I have had at Border's in MA.  Lobster ravioli was decent but the filling wasn't seasoned that well; the blush sauce was pretty good, though.  The grilled eggplant with goat cheese and pesto was very different but delicious.  Give it a try if you are looking for something different!  Service was good, but a little on the slow side.  Prices are on the steep side.  I did like the fact that they have espresso drinks (latte anyone?) and offer wifi (can't live without the ipad)."}
{"input": "The bar and staff are AMAZING. we got a room upgrade for have been being on our honeymoon and the view was gorgeous. But, the room was not any better than a hilton. It had rust in the tub floor, and some weird stains on the tile. But this was only in the bathroom, so i give it 4 stars! Great staff, but too much for valet so we parked a couple streets down. That was the only other con I would say. \n\nWould recommend if you want to be literally in the working downtown area of st. louis. Lots of cool bars and restaurants on a friday night."}
{"input": "Great food and ambience! The wait staff were so friendly and helpful. The food.... Where do I start? One word.... Amazing! We had the traditional pancakes with cinnamon cream syrup, ham, eggs and has browns.... So good!"}
{"input": "These girls have mac on lock. it was fast, clean and i was stuck in traffic eating allll my food. (and you know i was hot when i saw on Facebook the next day they had a sale) but that is what i love about them... they give and give! \nif you can try the mac with the cheese steak on top.....seriously a top notch!!!!"}
{"input": "The sushi is always fresh; service is great and the prices are the best in town. Although I have to say the RuSans in Charlotte, NC is step up and prices are better...."}
{"input": "I think Dawn Patrol could become 4 stars but not just yet for me. I like the idea of make your own hash but the components need work. The corned beef was soggy when it should have been crispy. The over easy eggs were closer to medium. The potatoes, spinach and mushrooms were fine as was the cheddar. The accompanying salad was not as fresh as it could have been. Lastly for $13 in a casual order at the counter place, the portions were small.\n\nThe space itself is wonderful with a number of seating options indoors and out. Everything is neat and attractive and well laid out. \n\nService is pleasant and competent.\n\nParking across the street in city lot."}
{"input": "As good as it gets in a mall food court concept (even an upscale one). The salads and bowls were delicious. The frescas were delicious (the lime, ginger, cucumber one in particular). The service was fast and helpful. I liked how they let you customize the bowls on the menu. We were able to make a bowl that had chicken, vegetarian by adding tofu. Will definitely be back."}
{"input": "Best wings in Indy. Get the signature sauce. Both locations have great atmosphere with awesome wait staff."}
{"input": "I could not have been more pleased with this restaurant! Excellent pricing, friendly service, and down right delicious food! (Even for Indian standards!) I asked for \"authentic level\" hot/spicy and they made the meal perfectly. They also sport an impressive wine selection. Ill definitely\nBe going back!"}
{"input": "The fries were delicious. The Louisiana Spicy Beef Hot Link is a zesty, spicy hot link that they place on a plain cold bun. I actually liked the taste but it was too spicy to finish. The condiments were typical of any hot dog restaurant that you might find elsewhere for a cheaper price but you're in Santa Barbara so that's not happening."}
{"input": "Good service but TERRIBLE FOOD. Overcooked everything, one of the worst dining experiences ever."}
{"input": "I've been here twice within the past two weeks... AND I LOVE IT! Each time trying something different. So far I love the chili burger. That was first time trying chili on a burger and I must say it won't be my last.  During the week they have a nice happy hour with local brews on the menu.. So that's a plus."}
{"input": "I recently came here again after I found out about the specials.  And yes they are still doing the $9.95/19.95 L/D specials for this month.  \n\nI went for the lunch buffet and immediately noticed a few things.  The sushi selection was cut in half, the hibachi and crepe stations were closed but most of the \"other\" foods were still there.  Although they did not taste good.\n\nThe sushi rolls did not taste good either but they didn't taste bad.  It was just enough to satisfy my sushi cravings as it had been a few quarters since I had it last.\nHad the soft tofu soup but it did not taste like the kind my mom makes.  \n\nOur server had a few questionable calls, mainly when I asked for water and he came back with a refill for my brother.  The rest of us needed a refill but never got one.\n\nIt's located about 50 mins from my house so chances are I will not return because of the distance and the fact I was not blown away by the selection/quality.  Also I wouldn't pay more than $10/20 for a buffet meal here.  But its OK."}
{"input": "Just got back today.  I would recommend this to anyone with kids.  Not bad for adults either.  We saw the highlights in the city and then dumped into the Delaware and back.  Had fun.  Tour guide plays music and gives the highlights and makes some bad jokes - keeps it fresh.  He made a couple of small historical mistakes so don't take everything as gospel.  Value was about right.  I think I paid $60 for 2 kids and me for about 1:40.  Tipped $6 on the way out.  The windowless vehicle makes it great for a nice day.  Check the weather report before you go.  Extra bonus is that some locals play up to the duck boats in the city, so that was nice (now that they give the duck whistles out at the end of the tour so the kids don't quack them throughout the city).  Well worth it."}
{"input": "You should eat here! We made a great decision stopping by for lunch provided my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our burger and BLT. In fact, there was nothing left on our plates. The burger's bun, caramelized onions, and meat were nearly perfect. The BLT's maple bacon was chewy, crunchy, and just sweet enough. I look forward to ordering french toast when we return to PA next year."}
{"input": "Holy mackerel!! This place is amazing!! Great service, amazing food and a fun atmosphere. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"input": "This is absolutely the dirtiest, most poorly equipped restaurant I have ever been to.  The floor is uniformly sticky.  The tables are filthy.  Do.not.look.down.  You won't like what you see.\n\nWe ordered two burgers, two drinks, and a 50/50 basket of fries and onion rings.  The burger: easily the tastiest burger I have found in Nashville.  Too bad they didn't have half the toppings that I requested from the menu board.  The 50/50 fry basket took 20-30 minutes to arrive.  When it did, the fries were amazing, the onion rings were colder than the soda we were drinking.  \n\nThe staff was friendly, and did their best to provide good customer service, which is why they got a second star.   \n\nThis place has the potential of being a great burger joint... just as soon as they invest heavily in bleach and Brillo pads."}
{"input": "The sandwich was fantastic!  The last time I was here was around 10 years ago and I remembered it being good. It still is! The shop on the inside could use a little refresher with decorating a little less clutter but as far as the food... best sandwiches I've had in town!"}
{"input": "Amazing service.  Friendly, sincere, and attentive.\n\nFood - Could be (much) better.  Soondobu jjigae is a very popular menu item and therefore hard to go wrong with but somehow they made my mom ask for salt.  Bland.  My spicy kalbitang on the other hand was so over the top spicy that I kept turning to my rice.  I loved how they bring out rice in the little stone bowls.  The waiter was really cute when he brought me white rice and my mother brown/bean rice without having to ask.\n\nThe interior is also spacious and clean.  Would definitely return for a meal before hanareum shopping."}
{"input": "Food was just okay. Waiter got my order wrong but I just settled for what I got.\n\nSitting next to kitchen made me uncomfortable, the workers there didn't seem to care that we could overhear their vulgar conversations. I wouldn't recommend bringing children to this restaurant unless you want them to learn a few new words.\n\nNext time I'll probably just go to a neighboring restaurant."}
{"input": "I love this place the owner dirty is great... So is his amazing staff Tone is my favorite!!!!"}
{"input": "Alaska Airlines rocks, mostly tight to schedule and always nice and friendly. Can't wait for affiliate Sky West to replace CRJ's with Embraer 175's but flight is short so not a huge deal. I'll fly AS every time!"}
{"input": "A great place! Friendly staff, great serive and solid food at reasonable prices. A great trifecta!"}
{"input": "Overall good experience from the from the front desk, to the tech who evaluated our dog and finally to the veterinarian who gave our dog the nose to tail exam. I highly recommend this place to anyone who needs veterinarian care."}
{"input": "As a frequent customer who has come since the place opened, I had previously rated this place higher, based on a recent experience decided to downgrade.\n\nMyself and both in-laws had visited, one of which was senior. Had a mail coupon for $5 off, which had no disclaimer.  I wanted to apply this to our party of three (2 adults, 1 senior). Cashier gave us a hard time stating that her management dictated that she wasn't allowed to apply the coupon if we were combining it with a senior discount. What logic is that? How would it be any different if I had paid for myself and my mother in law, applied the coupon. Then told my father in law, the senior, to pay on his own. Seriously, Retarded. \n\nThis is on YOU management not that poor girl. Either for not creating a better customer experience or poorly training your staff."}
{"input": "this is a great place to hold mixers, and business meetings, like Your Business Network (YBN), it is local and so far what I have tried there is good, capuchinos, croissants, chai tea, and others are good, the staff is friendly and clean. \n\nI like it very much to meet with clients and supporting local business is the way to improve Reno's economy.\n\nHouse wine is good and inexpensive, great venue to host reunions.\n\ngood job!"}
{"input": "Great seafood - Love the fried shrimp. My husband got the stuff I tried it but didn't like it so much. He's had the stuffed Mirliton"}
{"input": "We are from Hawai'i and know good sushi! First off, for the price you pay for all you can eat, you cannot beat it! The service is awesome, sushi chef if spot on and the food is 'Ono-licious (Hawaiian for DELICIOUS). I cannot say enough about the presentation, so you're just gonna have to stop by and see for yourself! I give this sushi joint a ten star!!! Will be back again when we return next year! Enjoy!"}
{"input": "each & every time i go home to visit my family in STL, i make it a point to get my happy ass to a ted drewes. do the same, and you won't be disappointed. custard is so much better than ice cream, and i swear that ted drewes' custard must have opiates in it. so insanely delicious. go. now."}
{"input": "Checked this spot out with work colleagues due to its convenient location to our work (we could walk & leave cars in parking garage!).\n\nPleasantly blown away!\n\nSicilian slice with pancetta & vidalia onions was unbelievably airy & done perfectly.\n\nShared an Italian Caesar salad -- little heavy on dressing but loved the anchovies!\n\nSplurged & got the sweet cream & cappuccino soft serve twist -- we all devoured this in minutes! Dining partners loved the assortment of Italian cookies (I was in gluten coma & could not do any more dough!  Fell off my GF wagon for the night). \n\nWould so come back again!\n\nGet here early ... We did thankfully; was packed by 6p."}
{"input": "This delicious ramen really warmed me up! I had the miso ramen and I loved the flavor profile of the broth. The noodles were tasty and the picked vegetables added a great contrast to the heartiness of the broth that kept the flavor balanced and not too savory. I also added on the black garlic wings because they were having a lunch special (add an app for $4). I was not a huge fan; even with lime juice sprinkled on the top, the fry on the wings was too heavy for me; I wonder if they were twice-fried? While I appreciated the crispiness, I would pass on these the next time around. I would add a caution that the restaurant is small and filled up for weekday lunch by about 12:15; they only have 4 2-person tables, 1 4-person table, and then the seats at the bar. However, this is a great place to come for a solid bowl of ramen, especially if it's cold outside."}
{"input": "Went there for their anniversary event. They have a pool table and some arcade games. All their beers are on tap and for sale. Great place to hang out. Tours of the brewing area are also available"}
{"input": "Had a great experience today with my tech and carpet cleaning service.  Donte arrived early and took his time: setting up, pre-treating heavily soiled areas and worked his way from upstairs to downstairs. I couldn't believe the results! Didn't have great expectations with the high traffic soiled areas and stairs but I was unexpectedly blown away. My carpet looks gorgeous, the nap is nice, soft and fluffy. I'm amazed and impressed! Totally satisfied! Thanks COIT and Donte!"}
{"input": "Hidden in the northeast side of The City Market,  Café Olivia is a must try.  Solid sandwiches, fairly priced and quick service.  The Godfather sandwich is a must try. So much talian meat and veggies you can hear the bread ( and amazing bread it is) crying for help. Check this place out!"}
{"input": "*note* I wrote a similar review on tripadvisor.\nI really wanted to like this hotel- it was charming and in a great location, with cute, unique rooms. It was just my style. Unfortunately, some blood-sucking insects ruined that.\nYup- bed bugs. We found them the morning we were leaving, because they normally come out very early in the morning (we were up at 530). Bleck! The management let us stay as long as necessary to take care of the issue (ie throwing away a bunch of our stuff and bagging the rest in ziplocks to be boiled) but it didn't change the fact that it was gross and a huge inconvenience. I threw away about $300 worth of clothing, shoes and luggage and I'm still worried that we brought the creatures back to our house with us. \nI would never stay here again, and I would urge you to think twice about it. Without seeing every carpet and mattress in the place replaced, there's no way I'd trust that the bugs were gone."}
{"input": "Allegro's is great. The pizza is really cheap, and lightning fast. My favorite was the sicilian, followed by the, uh, meaty kind, followed in a close third by anything stuffed (sometimes the centers were cold). They also sell beer, but I can't comment much on that because when I lived in Philadelphia I was under 21.\nThe only downside is the service (occasionally rude) and the constant crazies that hang out there talking to themselves."}
{"input": "I found this place through Yelp reviews, as I've been looking for a great Indian place in the Northeast. The food is delicious (I've tried a handful of dishes), and the portions are large. Definitely a go-to for take-out, and if you don't mind the semi-awkward decor (it feels more like an office than a restaurant to me, for some reason), it's a nice non-chain, non-pizza/burger place option for a casual dinner."}
{"input": "Best food in Northeast...amazing daily specials...love the Cuban pork egg rolls...try something different every time!"}
{"input": "Stayed one night.  Room was clean and comfortable.  Employees were consistently the best!  Valet, front desk, servers, room service, all were courteous and eager to please.  Good place to stay, would return."}
{"input": "New to the area and was looking for a good brunch/breakfast place that has a lot of gluten free options.  GF bread is available for all the sandwiches and they made sure to note that they put GF bread on my Lil Goat egg sandwich (which was amazing!) when they delivered the food. Portion was very large too."}
{"input": "I absolutely love the wings here! The sauces are delicious and I recommend the honey mustard and their buffalo fries both are winners. I've never once been disappointed from the food here!"}
{"input": "mmmmmm, scotch eggs and a super hopped IPA or a dark, toasty porter.  This is a must stop kind of place if you like good beer.  If you're looking for $2 domestic bottles, go somewhere else.  They have the typical brewpub grub and outside seating.  I don't go as often as I'd like, but always look forward to it.  They usually have a couple of seasonals on tap that always seem to be good.  I've never had a bad beer here."}
{"input": "Went there the other night and the service was horrible. Girl behind counter yawned in my face than said \"what you want?\" Seriously? That's how you ask to take my order? Wow.. Trying not to judge the entire experience on terrible service, we tried our sundaes and were even less impressed. Our turtle sundae didn't have any caramel in it - you know -one of the main ingredients, my Christy had the worst iced brownie in it if ever tasted - total bargain basement, still frozen, so bad even a little Debbie brownie would have been a massive upgrade & the Smore was a pretty light on toppings, pretty sad excuse... Not going to waste my money here again, that's for sure! Will spend my money @ How Sweet Is This & Fritz's for now on, where I actually get what I pay for and more..."}
{"input": "Food was pretty good. Service not so great. Not as fun as the locals make it sound. It is a pretty cool place being on the water."}
{"input": "We went to this place after looking on Yelp--duh. We were a group of about 10 and needed somewhere to go that would be able to serve all of us. As soon as we got there we notices the place was packed and everyone was happily eating. The food is served family style and we had a mix of different people including my boyfriend who loves food the spicier the better, my grandmother and picky little me. We ordered a couple of apps and entrees for all of us to share. The food was excellent, with some of it being a bit too spicy for my taste. We ordered more than enough and the bill only came out to $13 per person! Which--when it comes to my family, that small of a bill is amazing!"}
{"input": "Pretty cool place to come as a one time thing If you're a Nashville tourist. Filling meal but busy and small building but otherwise super yummy and good spot."}
{"input": "We enjoyed our visit to this Cheddar's.  The restaurant was busy but we were seated immediately and not long after we were seated our waiter came for drink orders. Nick, our waiter, was very attentive, polite and friendly yet professional.  I did not see anyone working there that looked 14 so perhaps that is why I missed out on the love fest, (I would have filmed that for you all). All but one of the employees I saw were kept busy and acted professional.  There was one, ( a hostess I believe), who was possibly bored (?), and decided to amuse herself by plastering her face to the glass partition while making a few fishy type faces at the diners. While this may have counted as entertainment to some, I would have preferred the love fest that I could have filmed. Admit it. If I had been able to film that you would have watched. I took off a star for the bad entertainment.  Other than that, the place was clean, the food was good and reasonably priced,  Nick was awesome....I would recommend it to others."}
{"input": "We wandered into Slate because the wait for brunch at Day by Day was longer than we were willing to wait. Unfortunately, getting seated immediately at Slate does not imply that you will get your food any faster. There were two other people in the restaurant when our party of six was seated but, despite the emptiness, our food somehow took 45 minutes to make. When we asked about the status of our meal we were told that they were doing their best but to keep in mind that \"we were a six-top without a reservation...\" Personally I think that having or not having a reservation seems rather irrelevant when your restaurant has plenty of open tables...\n\nIn conclusion, I've experienced better and faster service. \n\nIf you have the time, the brunch is good (I enjoyed the frittatas and home fries/chips - although that may have been my hunger talking)."}
{"input": "Just an update regarding the only complaint in my first review of Kajuns: the smoke. They've since installed a couple of smoke eaters that have made the air extremely breathable for people who, like me, have sensitivities to cigarette smoke. I previously would get headaches because of the smoke if I stayed at Kajuns too long, as I am wont to do, but now I can hardly notice that people are smoking while I'm sitting inside the bar! (When I leave, it's a different story as my clothes still smell like smoke, but that's a compromise I am willing to make.) Just goes to show you how dedicated the Kajuns staff is to improving the experiences of their customers. Thank you Kajuns!"}
{"input": "LOVE this place! Fresh, hot, delicious pizza and breadsticks. The decor and atmosphere is great, it's a nice clean establishment with great service. I accidentally left one of my favorite jackets hanging on my chair tonight and walked all the way back to my car when I turned around to see our server, Joseph, running after me with my jacket in hand. He was able to track me down almost all the way to Bankers Life Fieldhouse! What a guy :) Thank you Joseph, we will definitely be back."}
{"input": "Heidi did an amazing job! In addition was treated like royalty when walked in the door  (by her husband. .found out later)\nWine and or soft drinks and snacks offered! \nVery happy! I'm a traveling RN so have been to many different Salons across country. ..very impressed!"}
{"input": "The only things you need to know about this great event:\n\n1) You must check this event out once in your life\n2) Try to go during the weekdays when it's not as busy\n3) Go to Bone Daddys BBQ (based out of Michigan) and live your best life\n4) You can BYOB\n5) Lines at certain tents can be annoying and speeds vary so choose wisely\n6) Carpool or uber there because the surrounding streets can be gridlocked"}
{"input": "Calling all curly haired girls!\n\nI moved to Philly the summer of 2011 with what can only be described as burnt out hair. I called the salon and asked for a recommendation of someone who was familiar with thick unruly dry curly hair and they gave me Elena - and boy am I thankful!\nI've been seeing Elena for three years now and my hair has totally changed. She's helpful with finding products (never pushy about the salon's products, but helpful in finding ones that fit your needs and hair goals), gives a great cut and you feel like a million bucks when you leave! No matter how you wear your curly hair - curly or straight -  she's familiar as she has curly hair herself. She's nursed my poor hair back to health and its literally the best its ever looked! Cannot recommend her enough!"}
{"input": "I have been using Jack Flash for 10 years. They provide exceptional service and work that is always priced-right. As a family-owned business, there's a personal touch to all the interactions I have with the employees. They are friendly and care about doing an exceptional job. \n\nThey have:\nRewired /rerouted electrical boxes in our home\nAdded lights & fixtures\nFixed outlets\n\nIn one instance, they smelled gas leaking! It was a small leak that could have been something big. PECO fixed it!\n\nJack flash is the best!\n10 stars!"}
{"input": "We loved it there. Went Saturday night with 3 people and even though WE messed up the reservation (we only said it was 2 not 3 of us) they accommodated us right away. The food was delicious and even though we were the last guests after a while they didn't try to get us out but chatted with us. Great service, great food, perfect I say! If George is around you are in great hands"}
{"input": "Wait staff was pleasant but food took forever even though it wasn't remotely busy. Burger bun too soggy .....fries have a funky dust on them. Everything was super salty or greasy.   What is all the hype about?   Not cheap either.  Terrible.  Stay away.  Seriously.   BTW.  Two hours later and my husband and I are both feeling queasy. Thank goodness for Alka Seltzer"}
{"input": "I'm really torn about the G'liff, but need to give it two stars for tonight's experience. There is no excuse for a bar/restaurant in this area to turn into what was ostensibly a Giants bar, with only 4 douchebag NYG fans outnumbering Iggles fans in this place. That's really f*ing sad. \n\nI was here for great Phillies playoffs wins this past season, including Halladay's historic no-hitter debut, and it was packed. That was mere weeks ago. What happened in the interim is a mystery, but while I will probably return, you can bet I won't be parking my ass here for future Iggles games. \n\nThankfully, the game turned around and the Gnats fans left with a loss. Still doesn't give this place a pass, though. Two stars. Embrace and support your local roots, G'liff."}
{"input": "Great service!  Mike Bass is the best!  Bernie also always takes great care of me.  Cars could be a bit cleaner, though."}
{"input": "My fiancée remembered Paul the bartender from a previous establishment, and found out he had moved to the Empire Bar at Broussard's.  Amazing classic cocktails - we had a Sazerac, a Ramos gin fizz, milk punch, and he had some Absinthe (not my taste).  The other bar staff all agree that Paul is very exacting about his cocktails - the right preparation, glass, garnish, presentation.  We had the Oysters Rockefeller for a snack, really delicious - four perfectly fried oysters on a dish of spinach with cheese, served with fresh bread.  In a city with dozens of great bars and restaurants, this one is a can't-miss."}
{"input": "Incredible red chile (or green) burritos and impossibly fresh tortillas. 'Minimalistic Decor'."}
{"input": "Foreword: My experience with the Bottleworks is as an event venue.\n\nEvery year, when the WUSTL department I'm in is trying to recruit new graduate students, we hold a social event here for the prospective and current students to mingle and get to know each other better.  The two years I've taken part in this event have just been a blast.\n\nThe Schlafly event room in the back-- I forget the name of it, but I think it has one-- is just a fun and unique place to have a private event.  The view of the Bottleworks is impressive, and the huge private bar set up on the side is just great.  I think the cost is pretty reasonable for us, too, which includes unlimited beer/wine per head along with a bunch of delicious hors d'oeuvre.\n\nI'm a member of the group that helps put the event on this year, and I definitely think we're sticking with the Bottleworks again.  Look forward to an updated review around February or March next year!"}
{"input": "Very impressed with this place! The food was amazing. Quick service chipotle style line ordering but with high-quality Indian food. Also the staff was super helpful in helping me decide what to get since I'm an Indian food newbie. Can't wait to eat there again!"}
{"input": "I am so very excited to see this store open up on the East Side! I've been itching to get a more varied local pet store in my neighborhood for a long time. Although Wags and Whiskers is nice, they are very specialized. I came in on Black Friday to get a collar for my pooch, and ended up leaving with a very comfortable harness that he absolutely loves, and a great first impression.\n\nThe store has the variety I desired while not overwhelming the customer like the big box pet retailers. I saw some things that I'm seriously considering purchasing for my two pets, the dog wash looks spectacular, and I loved seeing the most trusted and wholesome brands on the shelves. One of the owners sold me the harness and was incredibly gracious about returns in case the harness didn't fit my dog, who is awkwardly sized for his weight. I didn't end up having to exchange it, but the help was welcomed.\n\nTL;DR - Small town manners with variety and modern amenities."}
{"input": "So it is a good friends birthday today and we all met up here. This place has a great, homey feel. It wasn't crowded at all. \n\nThe service was prompt and friendly, my burger was good, not great. Menu said it's charbroiled...seemed more like pan fried, and the meat was well done / dry. Oh well. My buds and I were all having a good time.\n\nWent down to the river and actually found some water!\n\nGood times on Paradise road."}
{"input": "Better than Hooters for both food and scenery.  The servers here are certainly friendlier.\n\nThe food is okay, basically pub food.  The menu is small, but who comes to a restaurant like this looking for an expansive menu?\n\nWe've been in a couple of times for lunch.  They usually are seating immediately.\n\nThe biggest downside is the parking lot.  Some of those potholes could swallow a car."}
{"input": "I went here last night with some of my friends. Good place, but nothing to RAVE over. I got the beet and goat cheese salad which was sub par. The vegetable platter was amazing though! Huge! Good place to go with friends, but nothing AMAZING. Good location and we sat outside!"}
{"input": "Great talent but that is not important when time\nIs more valuable. Sitting here on 3/23/18 at 11:28am. Supposedly opened at 11am. There are 5 of us waiting but no employee to provide service. Tsk, tsk Perfect Arch!"}
{"input": "I came in to the store to get a prescription for contacts.  The exam was quick and painless, and I didn't have to wait at all (I had an appointment).  The staff are friendly, knowledgeable, and they don't try to 'sell you' like some other places.  They provided me with multiple contact lens brands to try, and they were helpful in finding the right contacts for my eyes."}
{"input": "It's a nice place. Really nice! Great service and awesome restaurants in the hotel. Clean rooms"}
{"input": "Once Upon A Child is an AWESOME store!  With quality items at a reasonable price. The staff knows what they are doing, they aren't pushy or in ur face but are helpful. Anyone who needs baby items should go here 1ST!"}
{"input": "Not sure why this place continues getting great ratings. We went on Sunday to grab some breakfast while it was raining out. Because of the rain and humidity we decided to sit inside. Well if the smell of dirty dish water didn't turn me off the noise of the kitchen sure did. We were given a table right in front of it. Beyond that I ordered eggs Benedict which was less than spectacular for $10 and my wife got the small something and it had some potatoes, 2 eggs scrambled and a muffin that also cost $10. When you add this all on top of the fact that we had to scream at each other to have a conversation and that the a/c was dripping on our table it didn't make for a great experience."}
{"input": "The service is always on point and the coffee is the best.  Not to mention the great snacks and sandwhiches.  They put alot of hard work and time into making this place a great neighborhood spot."}
{"input": "Amazing Sunday brunch! Yes, they do have unlimited champagne or mimosas for their Sunday brunch. Not only is the food delicious, service exceeds expectations and you'll never worry about your glass being empty. 18.99 plus tax gives you all the food you can possibly handle, along with frequent refills. Even if you have only coffee or just water, they keep the refills coming! Excellent service, awesome price and delicious food. Our server, Maria, went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. Thank you, El Dorado Casino, for the best brunch we've had in Reno. We will definitely be back on our next visit!"}
{"input": "A very neat little hole in the wall. Very clean with extremely good food in more than reasonable portions. Will definitely be back!"}
{"input": "Garbage. I ordered a TV from pilot on December 4th with an arrival estimate between Dec 8th-15th. The day of the 15th before 8:00pm. I took off work to wait for my TV and at 6:15 on the 15th they called me to schedule a delivery but the package arrived the day before on the 14th. They told me the quickest they could have it delivered & to me was by was in another 5 days. Come to find out I could have picked it up, only about 10 minutes from my house. AVOID PILOT at all costs."}
{"input": "I've stopped here twice on a Sunday for the lunch buffet. I like the complimentary tea and mango lassi and the food is average. However, each time I've been there a woman (possibly the owner/manager) has been on her cell phone talking nonstop while seating people, while filling water glasses and even while checking people out when leaving. She can't put the phone down to greet or say thank you?  And the entire time we were eating she was on the phone in the back of the restaurant and wasn't very quiet in her conversation. I think next time I try one of the other Indian restaurants in the area."}
{"input": "I've been to lots of Asian restaurants. This is definitely my favorite! Everything is very authentic and obviously home-made. I just always want to go there for lunch or dinner!"}
{"input": "The environment of the restaurant is very nice. Service was very good and they were able to take care of us really well and fast although we were a huge group. The food was well prepared but we did not find it unique or special."}
{"input": "My hubbie and I have been taking our trucks here for a few years and can't complain. Every Wednesday is ladies day, so you get a discount on any of their wash options. (Firemen also get a discount on Mondays) . This isn't a hand-wash, so it's not perfect  but a good $5 carwash if your \"baby\" needs a quick bath.\n\nThey do run a special every now and then on auto detail packages 2 for 1. My husband and I always buy when they're running this special, since they have always done a nice job."}
{"input": "Four stars for a great little gem. I stopped in last minute before a show and was able to grab 2 seats at the bar. \n\nThe drinks were glorious, the bartenders were glorious, and I had a salad the size of a small infant.\n\nIt did seem to fill up fairly quickly, so I recommend a reservation and empty bellies."}
{"input": "Kelley's is a good solid place to eat. The breakfast/brunch menu is outstanding. I like the dinner menu as well. I also like coming to the bar in the evenings. They have a great location and have been doing a great job for many years."}
{"input": "Fried rice looks like brown rice about 2 1/4 in chunks of egg. No vegtibles to be recognized . Like they had a water gun of soy sauce and was randomly shooting the rice,  while they were drying it out.. I gave it 2 stars, because I am generous like that."}
{"input": "I am a huge fan of Iron Hill but since the closest one was in a half hour from me I didn't go often. I'm glad they put one in Voorhees it is much closer and much larger than the Moorestown location. \n\nI went last night and it was packed but still had awesome service. We had Chris as our server and he took the time to explain in detail any of the beers we were looking at as well as suggest some he thought we might enjoy.\n\nI had the Saison and Raspberry Wheat both of which were awesome if you like a little fruit to your beer. We also had the wings and chicken tacos. No complaints on those either very good. The price is decent too we got out for $50 with five beers and the food."}
{"input": "Pretty good Beef Quesadilla, my girlfriends frozen margarita was pretty good, a little pricey for what you get. Our waiter reminded us of Brian from Half Baked, service was prompt and friendly. Most likely to return."}
{"input": "This is the best Thai restaurant that we have found in the Newport Richie Pasco County area. The quality and the amount of the food is excellent. The food is quite tasty and they make it to your liking as far as spiciness is concerned. The service is excellent and there is a discount for cash payment. A great place to eat for any occasion."}
{"input": "This is a popular place to go for us students after exams on Friday. They have an excellent burger selection and the out door patio is now open for business. They have done a great job fixing it up. Live music outside and a decent selection of tap and bottle beers.  Enjoy"}
{"input": "The Cubby Hole is very intimate and has great food. I've been there several times for lunch and breakfast, they don't disappoint. The coffee and baked goods are excellent."}
{"input": "I started coming to Moreno when I moved back to Brandon and had an itch for Alessi Bakery but didn't  want to drive too far. Someone told us about Moreno so we gave them a shot! A great, small, FAMILY-OWNED (love it!) bakery right in the heart of Brandon. They make a HUGE variety of baked goods from fresh bread to huge cupcakes to flan and cookies! They also have the best freshly made cuban sandwich with their own special sauce spread! My favorite thing to get here are the almond sticks. I am a huge fan of anything almond, but these are so fresh with loads of almonds and almond flavoring! If you have a sweet tooth, this is DEFINITELY the place to go!"}
{"input": "Run to this place and get your free shot check in offer!!  Even though it was jam packed with few seats open, it was still easy to find street parking.  There are many tables outside for enjoying the weather and plenty inside for those inclement days.  We tried a hot cinnamon roll and it was gooey and delicious.  The frosting was a bit lemony which really brightened the flavor up.  I was in love with my triple shot latte.  Everything about Coffeebar was charming and delicious."}
{"input": "Dudes.  Seriously... so good. So so soooo good.  The rutabaga fries are the most amazing thing ever.  The rutabaga cheese is better than any real cheese wiz I've ever had in my life.  The Reuben cheesesteak may or may not have also brought a tear to my eyes.  I mean,  this place is amazing.  The\"pot holes\" brownies. Holy crap. We ate one before we got our food.. ate,  left and turned around and went in and bought 2more. That didn't make it back to Jersey with us.   Don't judge me.  Try one, you'll see. I wish there was more seating,  but other than that, there's not one bad thing to say.  Some of the best vegan food we've had yet.  Thanks wiz kid!!"}
{"input": "Went to this Taco Bell last night.  It was 1 30 and it said 30 minutes to close.  All the lights were on.  We backed up and forward twice and no one would wait on us.  We gave up and pulled up young man was at window closing  register.  Taco Bell was happy to serve us."}
{"input": "In Montecito everything is so Montecito. This establishment is nice, and the food is fine. It is of course expensive but the menu is probably more flavorful than the actual food.\n \nWe had the burger which was good if a little on the greasy side and a chicken sandwich affair which was drenched in pesto and just fine. We were not so thrilled about our food that we will be rushing back there.\n\nThere were plenty of other options on the menu for dinner and I don't know whether these are better, but the bistro fare was not much better than reasonable.\n\nThe server was good, friendly and open to questions about this or that. We sat on the small outdoor patio made special by a grand sunset. \n\nThe dining room inside is stony and on the cold side. There is however some great art hung throughout. \n\nI'm not disappointed, nor do I have a complaint about portion size or menu variety. It was just ok. I probably expected a little more walking in than what is really there."}
{"input": "I brought in a truck that had been sitting under an oak tree for a year, and it was a mess.  The city gave me a warning that it was considered a \"junk\" car and would be towed if I didn't move it.  I put a new battery in it and took it to Mike's because it was closest and I was afraid of getting a ticket if I went drove any farther.  It took the better part of a day, but when I went to pick up my truck I couldn't believe it.  It looked like a brand new car.  Mike and his crew, as well as the two guys that own the car lot, are very nice, honest, and accommodating.  It was a very pleasant experience."}
{"input": "My boyfriend and I went here for the first time and had a great experience. The service was very friendly and fast. She was able to keep up on drinks which is a big factor for us. Nothing worse then half way through the meal and having nothing to wash it down with. Anyways, for the food I ordered a club sandwich and fries and he got the fish and chips. The sandwich was huge and delicious. On the other hand, the fries had very little taste and were not impressive at tall. Maybe they need some spice? I'm thinking next time I will try the kettle chips which aren't even home made so I am not sure they would be worth it. My boyfriend enjoyed his fish and chips but had the same opinion the fries. In conclusion, the main course is delicious but the fries are bland. We will definitely go again to try something different!"}
{"input": "The staff spent over 10 minutes on the phone with me answering all of my ridiculous questions about my serious dietary needs & what they have to offer. Two thumbs up for the patience and kindness they offered me!!!"}
{"input": "If I'm basing my rating on the taste and quality of the food, then I must give it a five star rating! I did not mind the atmosphere, which admittedly leaves a bit to be desired. I was too busy eating our delicious dinners. My companion had Chicken Tikka and I had Malai Kofta. Definitely loved both of them and their prices were exactly what I would expect to pay. We are already planning our return trip."}
{"input": "Called in a Mediterranean chicken shawarma. Good flavor and they were generous with the amount of chicken in the pita. The food was ready to go when I arrived. Good service. I would revisit the next time I am in the area."}
{"input": "I've gotten my bridesmaid dress altered here for a RIDICULOUS price. I think they charged me like $45 or something along the line for a simple hem. They did an OK job. Definitely not worth $45. When I got my jeans hemmed here, it was a reasonable price of about $10, but it was so obvious that the hem was done crooked. I don't think I'll ever come back here."}
{"input": "We tried it and the place looks pretty fancy we thought maybe out of our the budget but at the end it ended up nicely priced for seafood. Very tasty jumbo shrimps with grits. I would say that we were not lucky due to some noisy group around bit the service was good woth great food, definitely a nice place to gove a try for seafood from NOLA"}
{"input": "A short walk from my apartment I was told about a small, welcoming cafe very popular for breakfast and brunch. It did not disappoint! I had a salmon scramble with egg whites the first time i went. The second time i went i got the tofu with brown rice breakfast plate. Both meals were great!! And i was seated quickly"}
{"input": "Simply the best Prime Rib in Philadelphia. They offer 2 sizes, an aprox. 16oz cut and a huge 36oz+ bone-in cut. Go for the bone-in, it is excellent! Tasty and tender.\nWe also had oysters and cherrystone clams on the half shell to start. They were fresh and perfectly shucked. \nWine list is \"OK\". Typical steakhouse mark up but nice to see they also offer an \"under $50\" list of wines (of course very mediocre wines under $50)\nService is a \"B\" only because it took a long time for the waiter to give us the menu and later on took a while to bring us fresh horseradish. But very nice and friendly.\nAgain, if you are in Philly and would like a proper Prime Rib, go here!"}
{"input": "Appreciated the quick turnaround time on my bridesmaids dress, but I had to trim the threads at the end of every stitch... not to mention my grey dress was hemmed with various shades of obviously green thread (lighting in the pictures is definitely more forgiving than the sunlight). Definitely feeling swindled by the bridal industry markup on this sloppy alteration."}
{"input": "I I had an amazing meal at smoke, the staff was so friendly, and the ribs were amazing, I highly recommend smoke BBQ!"}
{"input": "We had a large party and were seated without delay.  The service and food were perfect.  It was mind blowing to find this quality, atmosphere and presentation inside a mall."}
{"input": "The sushi here is so much fun! I love seeing stuff like sunflower seeds and kiwi on top of the rolls. Very clever stuff. I had a great meal here. Twice! Lots of fun. I didn't try the fried stuff, so I can't speak to that."}
{"input": "I can usually count on prompt service and good food when I go to cpk. today, the host greeted us warmly, but my good experience ended there. it took over 30 min to get our pizza. the server brought 3small pieces of toast to hold us over. then, the pizza was over done. the basil was burnt. then, it took so long to get the check I had to leave while my husband stayed behind to pay. very disappointed in my latest experience"}
{"input": "every time I am in here, I'm amazed at how rude the cashier is and how indifferent the servers are. food is overpriced. menu is not exciting or original."}
{"input": "My husband and I went this morning for breakfast. He ordered a bacon egg and cheese on a long roll and there was one egg, one piece of cheese, and one slice of bacon on each half of the roll. for $7.50. my french toast was hard. the fries were cold. it's a shame because I came before and the food was average diner type of food. this was just overpriced and disappointing.  needless to say, we won't be back."}
{"input": "I used Sultans last year and this year for moving and both times they were wonderful to work with! The first time I used them, they realized that my couch didn't fit through my door (after trying extensively) and they would not be able to hoist my couch up to my second floor unit due to an awning. They stored my couch for free and then came back a week later with a creative and innovative way to successfully get my couch through the window! They came back to move me out of the same unit this year, Tom remembered me and was super helpful in facilitating the move out. They were so friendly the whole time and truly made both of my moves easy! All of the movers both times were super friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend them for anything."}
{"input": "Well.... The food is good love the spicy mayo the employee are nice but the owner Wes is horrible I came in Last week to order tempura chicken they changed there Menu so she said get a child one for 7 I was fine with that it came with a lot of stuff which I don't eat I just eat the tempura so they gave me Just Chicken on a plate it used to be 3.99 for tempura and you got 4 pieces now it's different so I received my food this jacka$$ Wes comes in and saw my meal which like I said was only chicken and tells the waitress charge her 12 dollars for it Huh?? So I feel this is so unprofessional and rude last time I step foot in there they told me one price and I'm charged a different I'm very upset he needs to practice better owner relations cause it sucks last time for me and the chicken was over cooked SMH!!!!"}
{"input": "I was here on a recent weekend in St. Louis.  Its good yes, but so is Culvers,  I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, sorry."}
{"input": "This is one of the busiest Chick fil A's I've seen but they always manage to be quick and have exceptional service! I seriously don't know how they can be so quick and great all the time! One of my favorite places!"}
{"input": "Suuuuuperrrr knowledgeable staff - enjoyed Brigid and Alex tour of the refrigerated section and sours knowledge. Food is ridiculous! in the co-op attached independently owned kitchen called The Nook OMGGGGG DUCK patty on a bed of greens since I did t want bun... to die for!!! Thanks Bridgette for the Spurs tasters to decide what was right for me. Memorable experience - I WILL BE BACK WITH FRIENDS  - oh and they have wine too."}
{"input": "Dr Kaplan is smart, knowledgable, and very personable. My wife and I have been coming here for two years. The staff is very accommodating as well. We have seen Dr Charles Kaplan and NP Lana Kessler and are very happy with both of them. Great practice! Highly Recommend!"}
{"input": "Awesome tacos. Great salsas. Delicious Margaritas! Happy hour 3-7pm. Friendly and attentive staff. Ask for a swirl of Mexican vanilla in you're iced tea. It's like my Abuela is in the back cooking this stuff!"}
{"input": "Another wonderful dinner at The Boiling House!! I'm so in love with their food.. Thank you Ms. Courtney for your service.. So kind, polite & sweet.. For checking in on Yelp I received a coupon for one free lemonade.. We had already ordered and drinks came with our meal, but Courtney had no problem with my request to take my free lemonade to go.. I just wish their establishment was larger because on busy nights it's hard to get in and I don't always like having dinner at 5 p.m. on Thursday but that's the best time to get a seat!!"}
{"input": "This is the best pizza in Roxborough!  The ingredients they use are top notch and they have such a variety of specialty pizzas.  I suspect the negative reviews are from competitors worried about their business!  The thin crust reminds me of the pizza I had in Italy.  The have a great deal for lunch or dinner...two huge slices and a soda for under $5.  I try to get there 3-4 times a week.   I can use my laptop in the dining area and also catch up on the news on the 2 HD tv's.    It's a great pizza!"}
{"input": "Went today for the first time, it was very nice. Wish I had a little more attention, it was very busy had a longer wait than expected. Would go back on a slower day."}
{"input": "We were in the neighbourhood for an earlier evening event. I remembered how much I enjoyed this place in the past. So I suggested we walk over for supper. \n\nI still like this restaurant. Friendly service, large portions and speed of food service is consistent from when I was here a few years ago. We all enjoyed our meals and didn't feel rushed to leave our table.\n\nHowever the years seem to have caught up to the place. Floor is noticeably worn down where the chairs are sliding back and forth at the tables. Bathroom was tidy but nothing exceptional by any means. Definitely want to watch that slightly raised floor going out of the bathrooms or that could be a tripping hazard. Everything is decently clean within the restaurant but this would only be a casual lunch place for me in the future."}
{"input": "I have to say is a normal hotel ... not nice and not ugly but the breakfast is super great. Cost me about $80 so I say is decent price. I would have like that they extended the breakfast time to 10am. I only had 20min, I got there at 8:35 for breakfast and when it hit 8:50 the lady started to put everything away ."}
{"input": "We hired Terra as the florist for our wedding and were very pleased with her work. We liked that she took the time to run through the venue with my husband and really tried to understand our needs and accommodate our budget. The florals for the wedding came out beautiful and we loved the draping for the ceremony and the reception. The only concern we had was that some of flowers in the bride's and the bridesmaids' bouquets started wilting during the day, but we understand that it is because the flowers were in full bloom and it could also have been due to the heat. Overall, we were happy we found Terra for our wedding!"}
{"input": "I recommend Yoichi's! I know the real taste in Japanese food, because I'm from Japan. They serve high quality Kaiseki style meal. Sashimi and sushi were very fresh and dashi in every dish was flavorful. They directly import fish and ingredients even real wasabi from Japan."}
{"input": "Pretty good house salad with Brussels sprouts and artichoke. More than usual sides of vegetables to choose from which is good for me Since I'm a plant eater. Have been here many times and the servers are always nice."}
{"input": "Great surprise below we drove home to San Diego. We bought another pizza to eat the next day at home. Great fresh toppings! Our favorite pizza place as of right now."}
{"input": "I have friends in Reno and visited this Bully's location this past weekend.  It was a special occasion as my niece was in the Reno area from Missouri and I surprised her for dinner.  She had no idea.  I informed the waitress of what we were planning and she helped me surprise my niece at the table.  I wish I would have gotten her name.  Very nice waitress!  Also a regular stop when I'm in the area."}
{"input": "This is a cute little place, but it needs to define itself a little better.\n\nPerhaps I was expecting too much after hearing it described as a gourmet grocery store.  I was dreaming of a tiny Whole Foods in downtown Tampa.  I didn't expect the (mostly non-organic) produce section to be found in a single refrigerator or to find bagged shredded cheese in the dairy section.\n\nI appreciate the low prices for the sandwiches.  They are pre-assembled, but they get heated/pressed to order.  I tried the turkey reuben.  Something in the sandwich (either the turkey or the sauerkraut) was very herby, and it dominated the dish, so I didn't get that wonderful reuben harmony I expected.  It was disappointing.\n\nI probably won't return for a sandwich, but this is a nice place to grab a bottle of wine or beer and maybe some gourmet snacks.  This is certainly not a replacement for a real grocery store."}
{"input": "I went to Andre Richard Salon for a cut and single process color and had the pleasure of having Christina as my stylist.  Christina is very knowledgeable about choosing the right color and the product lines that they carry and is very skilled with giving you the exact cut that you want.  The salon itself is in a great location and has a fabulous makeup station in the back and the entire staff was very friendly.  I had my hair dyed a very dark color and received a cut & bang-trim and was extremely happy with the final look.  Christina has been my trusted stylist for years and I know she is extremely talented across the board.  Wonderful experience and I will most definitely be returning and recommending to friends."}
{"input": "Fantastic service from Jo Jo! Recommended through my insurance company there is a reason why they prefer this excellent vendor. Jo called to ask if he could show up EARLY which was great as it freed up my day. Work was performed perfectly and in record time. I hope if I need another windshield that Jo Jo shows up! Thanks Safellite!"}
{"input": "My boyfriend and I have visited here a bunch of times and we will still be coming here! Everything has always been great! Mussels are amazing in the white and the red! Chicken Marsala is amazing! The drinks are a little to expensive, some of them being as much as your meal itself, but I guess that's because the location. Grab a drink across the street at Las Vegas lounge first to pay average price for a drink than head to an amazing dinner here!"}
{"input": "I went here for the first time yesterday, and I was so happy! I have been in Ardmore for over two years, but never went to this salon for a pedicure. I was always driving out of my way to somewhere in KOP. However, never again! I got the best pedicure I have ever had yesterday. They do the best job and Estela was amazing. Thank you olive nails  for the best experience, you'll be the only place I ever go back to."}
{"input": "Delicious food, relaxed atmosphere, cocktails refreshing and Katie our waitress very friendly and knowledgeable on the menu and helped us make the right choice .5 stars"}
{"input": "The best total body workout I've ever done. My husband and I have been members for 12 years and have never had the same workout twice. Trainers are excellent, motivating, careful and knowledgable, plus they are really fun and make the workouts really fun and challenging."}
{"input": "I've tried many sweet treats here, and it's ALL very good. This bakery has the taste to be world renown.  I hope to see more locations, but whatever magic they work in this shop, im just happy i can get to it. It's that good."}
{"input": "Checker was very rude, asking us (two of us bagging) to pack our $250 bags more quickly.  I spoke with management about this as it was not our fault that we have to bag our own groceries to save a few bucks.  As I've recommended several people there as being a bright and happy service agents just as much as I'll complain about bad service."}
{"input": "Everything about this place is awesome.\n\nWe decided to go for Sunday brunch, and could not have been more pleased. We were initially concerned with the 25 minute wait outside, but were pleased when they called us after just 10 minutes. \n\nI had the French toast which was outstanding, and my sister ordered the grilled cheese, which was \"one of the best she's ever had.\" \n\nThe place was hopping, the staff was friendly, and they're very fast and efficient. Overall, AMAZING place to have breakfast in Tucson."}
{"input": "After going there several times going to Fresh I am sad to report my last visit was not up to par.  I went with a group of people and the service / product was not how it used to be and the price was outrageous to say the least.  I entered and was not greet by the staff  and I do understand that the group I was meeting with was taking up most the inside of Fresh, but a little acknowledgement would have went a long way.  Also, I ordered the Vienna Latte with an extra shot.  It not only was one of the worst espresso based drinks I have ever had, but it was EXPENSIVE $7+ for a coffee?!?!  After realizing the price for the drink I was put off by ordering any products.\n\nI really love Fresh and obviously from prior posts I do praise their products, but this time it was one of the worst experiences I have had."}
{"input": "All around class-act place. Really sharp looking bar and restaurant. We were just in for drinks but the food looked good. Casual modern and upscale place in a historic setting. \n\nFrom the hostess to the concierge everybody was very friendly. The bearded bartender was the star of the show. Nice to find a place with bartenders with personality."}
{"input": "We've been meaning to stop in, and tonight, we finally did. And glad we were!\n\nThere isnt much different to say that everyone hasnt already said, so I will just reiterate some of the reasons why Taste of Havana will become a regular spot for us. \n\nI had the Pan con Bistec, and my wife had the Cuban. We loved the bread (and everything between it). Usually we take home half our sandwiches to eat for a second meal, but I just wasnt ready to stop eating for the night, so alas, I dont have another meal. Guess I'll just have to go back! \n\nAnd the company was just as inviting. We chatted with Diana (Dayana?), for quite a while after we ate, and she told us how she and her dad opened the restuarant, and how it really is a labor of love. \n\nTry it out. Order a sandwich, have a seat, chat them up, and enjoy! I'm already looking forward to our next visit, and thinking about who else I want to bring with us.\n\nThank you for a wonderful evening!"}
{"input": "Both my husband and I have been working with EF for over a year to handle our book keeping. It is truly a pleasure working with everyone over at EF. In the short time, I've been woking with EF, I've learned so much. They are incredibly detail orientated, patient, attentive and  great partners for our growing business."}
{"input": "If you work at AB, this place is pretty much your go-to lunch spot. Friendly staff and always a solid sandwich. Quick service, but they make both the hot and cold sandwiches with a little extra love and care. The mesquite turkey and the \"St. Louisan\" are my two personal favorites. Some outdoor seating or you can always head across the street to the park for an impromptu picnic."}
{"input": "If you like a quiet  shopping experience without the crowds, this mall is the place for you."}
{"input": "Pulled pork and fried fish are great.    Don't miss the sweet tea.  My wife had the white beans and cold slaw really good much better than my Mac and cheese and potatoe salad.    But a must eat if you love bbq."}
{"input": "I didn't actually buy anything from here but I had never check it out so I decided to take a look. \n\nWestern Cycle is a huge bike store and probably the best place to get a bike. When I was younger and was into bike riding I would always think of Canadian Tire when I needed a new bike but I wish I knew about this place back then. It's a bikers haven. They have all kinds of bikes for everyone and they range from about $100 to $5000. It seems like the perfect place for people who are passionate about biking.\n\nThe staff seemed to know everything about the bikes and other bikes in general. Aside from bicycles they also have biking accessories like clothes, helmets, etc. They also have a service department to take care of your bike maintenance for you or even fix it up.\n\nI don't bike anymore so I would probably never go here but I highly recommend it to all people that love riding bikes."}
{"input": "Best Cuban sandwich in town, and quite possibly the best black bean soup I've ever had. Super friendly service. This is definitely a spot to check out."}
{"input": "Love this place.  I always come here for quick delicious donuts.  Chocolate cake with chocolate frosting is delicious.  The place itself is TINY though.\n\nHowever I am not giving this place 5 stars because last saturday night I came here around 10pm to grab late night donuts... the lady who waited on us was not friendly at all.  Didn't even say HI or welcome or anything.  Not a fan of that type of customer service."}
{"input": "I think it is important to reuse when possible instead of buying new. And when I shop here, I get to save money in the process! This is the absolute best place to find great deals, attentive and kind service, and cute, gently used clothes for your kids. When it is time for school clothes shopping, go there first!"}
{"input": "I don't recommend this hotel. The rooms are VERY small and outdated...peeling wallpaper and wall AC. Although most advertisements indicate that breakfast, restaurant and bar are available, they are not connected to the hotel. On arrival, we were given a key to a room that was occupied...we walked in on them!"}
{"input": "This is a great fresh fish market/lobster shack! If you want fancy this isn't the place for you! Styrofoam plates and lots of lobster! Jessica rocked at customer service! I shot a claw across the restaurant (NEWB) and she brought a new claw! Try the crab cakes and bread pudding."}
{"input": "The only thing I love more than their coffee are the baristas that work here. It's a quiet, good place to read a book and enjoy a multitude of drinks they offer."}
{"input": "The Best icecream on this side of heaven. I love this place the icecream here is soo flavorFULL whew! New Orleans has the best of the best even when it comes to ICECREAM :) one u come here for icecream you'll forget about baskin robins and cold stone sorry not sorry lol ENJOY"}
{"input": "If you miss the vietnamese restaurant Pho Tau Bay, this one comes pretty close in terms of overall experience.  Granted, I've only had the Pho here at Le and haven't tried any of the Bun or Bahn Mi.  But I really really enjoyed my Pho Tai.  The serving size of the soup was generous and packed with noodles.  The herbs were fresh and served in perfect amounts on a nice serving tray.  The meat was also fresh; it was eye of round  that was rare initially upon serving but immediately cooked to done when stirred into the soup.  The beef broth was crystal clear and had a nice, clean flavor.  Overall, I would call the experience of the Pho just about perfect.\nThe atmosphere and service were pleasant.  It lies somewhere between the lunch counter type vietnamese places, and the ones that are more refined and Americanized.\nOverall a joyful experience and I will definitely be back!"}
{"input": "I recently stayed here with my husband and had a wonderful time. The hotel is beautiful, the location is perfect, and the Carousel bar is one of the best bars in New Orleans. But my main motivation in leaving this review is to thank a man that works there named Malcolm who helped me tremendously one night. He did not hesitate to assist me and went over and beyond. We will definitely be staying here again."}
{"input": "They are dirty, have very bad service, they are very distracted. They stop during your mani + pedi to help someone else for 15 min at a time. Took almost 2 hrs for me and a friend to get a mani pedi, and not because they were being attentive. Would not recommend, will not go back. Tina's Nails is awesome."}
{"input": "Came here on a whim after just moving here 6 weeks ago. Absolutely loved it! The service was stellar. The food was good (nothing to write home about), but overall a great experience. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who anyone looking for a casual meal and a good time. I look forward to returning for more happy hour specials and even the occasional live music show."}
{"input": "By now you've read what type of place this is.  It was just as fun and hip as others say.  Some of the food was excellent, some just good.  Nothing was disappointing."}
{"input": "If u love ice cream, you'll be in heaven here!  A must try!  So many unique flavors to choose from and they're always changing."}
{"input": "We have eaten at Dolce Vita on several occasions and each time the food was exceptional!!!  We have since had our sons rehearsal dinner there and Frank and his wonderful wife (and chef) could not have been nicer and more accommodating.  The food was out of this world and they allowed us to bring in our own alcohol which kept the price so reasonable.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a great meal at a reasonable price in a homey and friendly atmosphere. Can't wait to return for dinner.  It is our new go to place with all our friends!,"}
{"input": "I saw Big Data when they came to town at the Knitting Factory. Some things:\n\nThe area is really skeazy. I am happy Reno is trying to change the image of the city, but that cannot be accomplished over night and this place is super creepy.\n\nThe sound quality is horrible. If you want to REALLY hear the band you paid to see, go somewhere else. The building is not shaped right for a concert venue and because of it, the sound will sooner bust out your eardrums."}
{"input": "Fast, responsive and pleasant staff.  Requested price late at night and had them by for service the next afternoon. Thank you!"}
{"input": "This was a very good grilled cheese.  I had the juice and it was good, had a good little bite to it with the pepper jack.  The bacon mac and cheese was also very good.  Will be back when I'm in town."}
{"input": "Always fresh and fast, once you taste these it ruins the other places for you. Going back to a Starbucks, Dunkin, or grocery store bagel is just not an option. \nAll the cream cheese flavors are mixed fresh in the store. The veggie cream cheese is awesome!\nThe owner is also charitable and frequently provides local nonprofits with end of the day bagels. It bears mentioning that he does so because everything is made fresh each morning so there are no carryovers."}
{"input": "First time having Sugar Cream Pie, very good if you love sweet stuff! Wide variety of flavors, but the staff could have been a bit more helpful/friendly for it being our first time in the shop."}
{"input": "Celiacs in the area def need to check out this place!\nThey have a number of gluten free options and accommodate to preventing cross contamination to the best of their abilities if you mention your dietary needs.\nMy fav thing from there is their chicken quesadillas."}
{"input": "I work at the Frist and I don't eat at the cafe much, since I like to leave the building and go home for lunch. But once in a blue moon on a really dreary day like today, I stay in and have the Cobb Salad. It's a go-to for gluten free noshers like me. Add an extra egg for extra protein punch (as if all the meat wasn't enough already) and oil and vinegar dressing and i'm doing ok. A lot of museum visitors and local employees come for the cheap prices and quick bites. Beware of Senior Mondays (every 3rd Monday of the month) and weekends at lunchtime- it's usually busiest at 1130-noon."}
{"input": "Best local pizza place around!   The pizza is delicious and fresh.  We've tried the Hot, Mild, Garlic Parmesan, and BBQ wings and all of them are fantastic.  This is a carry-out place, so don't expect to bring the family in, but there are a couple of small tables if you're just running in to get a Stromboli or something for lunch.  I've tried the Stromboli and the calzone and i prefer the calzone but that's just my preference.   As for the pizza, we've tried a few kinds and all have been great, but we usually just pick pick up a large mushroom for the $7.99 carry-out special.   Staff is nice and friendly and they're usually pretty quick."}
{"input": "Make sure you make a reservation especially for weekend brunch, it gets packed! We had to wait for an extra 15-20 minutes despite making a reservation and arriving early so this slightly dampened the experience. \n\nFood, however, was incredible, I had a dish that was like a stew of vegetables with eggs on top and almost licked my bowl clean. \n\nGreat brunch spot that I would recommend to friends and family (if they can get a table!)"}
{"input": "One of their guests went on a rampage and started punching random people, knocking one to the ground.  I told the bartender to call security, then I restrained the assailant as efficiently as humanly possible, causing no injuries, no striking, basically a bear hug, until security finally arrived.  Instead of a thank you I was told to go to my room or I would be trespassing--- fine, Did they look at the video and figure it out? Make it right later?  No.  I was treated poorly, and when I called days later, I got no response.  Spoke with Art in Security, and no call back. \n\nNot  the way to treat someone who helped you out. \n\nI will not be going back to Peppermill."}
{"input": "Applebee's isn't really my thing, but I had a gift card, so we stopped in. It was actually pretty good. My wife's portabella chicken was very tasty and perfectly cooked. My bourbon street steak was also cooked nicely, but it did have that weird Applebee's steak texture. The pretzel sticks were a really good appetizer, though. Ceasar salads were fresh and good. Not too shabby, Applebee's!"}
{"input": "This is a hidden gem. (And I do mean hidden - it's a tiny place, and we accidentally drove right by it before we found it.) My husband and I really loved this place! My husband ordered special rolls, I ordered a combination, and both were wonderful and very well priced. It's fun watching the chef putting everything together."}
{"input": "Just finding Red Robin when looking for a steakhouse. As a frst timer the waiter told us a lot about the loyalty program.\n\nWe had fish n chips and the delicious burger with beacon. The fries are excellent, the beef pink in the middle - i love it. Only the fish had too much batter around.\n\nDrinks are good.\n\nAll in all it's worth the price - but gourmet? I don't think so."}
{"input": "This is by far my favorite park to come and hike the trails with my dog ON THE LEASH.  The actual dog park with the off-leash dogs can get a little sketchy at times. Most of the big dogs that are out are trained well however there's always one or two in the bunch that are a little bit too aggressive/ not listening to their owners, for my liking. If you have a smaller dog and want to go off leash I would recommend something a little more calm like the Voorhees Connolly Park. It's small but gets the job done.   However if you want to spend the afternoon walking around the trails jogging,  having a little frisbee toss, and generally getting some good exercise for you and your dog, this is the place"}
{"input": "Not our type of art but the space is a beautifully restored barn by the river and the Wyeth family collection is impressive.  The top floor collection was very good.\n\nNice surprise to find some varied modern pieces on 2nd floor of different artists who created in local area - including Horace Pippin.  Come prepared and review The last Mohicans or Treasure Island first to better appreciate some of the pieces on ground floor.\n\nThere was a brunch special going on that seemed to attract a lot of locals.  Scenic since right by the river.\n\nTake advantage of early Sunday free admission ."}
{"input": "Very slow service for a very simple order. Food quality was average compared to other KFCs."}
{"input": "The Honey Apple grilled cheese sandwich is totally to die for! I never been more happy to eat a grilled cheese sandwich in my life! The staff is friendly, the decor is cool and hip, and the food is great. The Meltdown in Montgomeryville does not compare. The service is rude and the decor is too futuristic/weird. I had my server throw my sandwich at me and splash another customer with soup at Montgomeryville. Regardless of then other shops, I love meltdown it really helps a cheese lover out!"}
{"input": "This was my first time here. I was very pleasantly surprised by how good the food is. I had not seen any Yelp reviews but saw some other reviews. People swore this was the best Chinese food they have had outside of major cities like Manhattan. They were right. While I was eating a guy came in and said to the clerk that they have the best Sweet and Sour soup. I will have to try that now. I had the beef chow mein. It was the best I have had at any Chinese restaurant!!! The beef was nice and tender. My meal came with fried rice (no pork) and tasted great. Very friendly family folk working there. I will come again next time I am in the mood for good Chinese food!!!!!"}
{"input": "Great bar off the lobby of the International Hotel in the CBD, a block off Canal St. We met a friend for drinks and we all had a variant of a Kir Royale made with Cava and a raspberry liqueur from St. George's Spirits in Alameda that was gorgeous. Service was friendly and prompt, and we enjoyed ourselves so much that we went back the next night to do it all over again."}
{"input": "I love this place!! They have really creative and affordable vegan/ vegetarian options, including vegan pastries. And their coffee so amazing."}
{"input": "BEST. SUSHI. IN. TOWN. The place itself doesn't look like anything special; a few table and a sushi bar. However, the fish is always fresh and well prepared. If you're into sauces and fish combinations in a single roll, this might not be the place for you. The chirashi is priced very well during lunch and the portions are generous. \n\nFor an authentic Japanese restaurant in town, this is it."}
{"input": "Do Not Come to this Place! The shrimp was disgusting you can even taste the dirt inside it. \nIt took the 20 min to serve it. And took them another 20 min for the gumbo. Most horrible is no service at all! None! I sit in the bar for 10 min no one serves me! Even after I ask the bar tender many times he took my order with a shitty face, I got no water no Fock knife no nothing the guy next to me even yelled at them to get service. I asked the woman from the kitchen sending gumbo for water she said as kinda surprised and said\" you want water?\" Oh yeah should I is she dumb? \n\nThe bar tender was busy counting money and cold as as ice, the other guy grilling oyster is ridiculous as well. And oh boy the food is way over priced for the poor quality.\n\nAnd the bar tender dare to have the face asking for 20% tip.\n\nTo the manager you should first fire the bar tender and then fire the chef, probably in the end fire yourself for hiring such horrible people!"}
{"input": "I needed a short term storage unit that was reasonably priced. Liz went over everything I needed to store to ensure I was getting the right size unit. This was my first time using a storage unit and it was very quick and easy to set up."}
{"input": "My friend and I stumbled on this place last night. Awesome find! Great beers and atmosphere.  Bartender was great. We did not eat but food looked great. We will definitely go back."}
{"input": "The best Beignet's. Hands down. This great shop is located in the most lovely outdoor open air market. Everyone is very friendly and welcoming. A couple New Yorkers were eating here when I walked by and their food got my attention. I had to take a seat and check things out for myself. Wow!! Do yourself a favor and find this place while in NOLA!"}
{"input": "Such a fun place!  Puts me in a great mood every time.  This store has a great selection of jewelry, some of which is locally made. I love the Evan Knox selections, and contrary to other posting, do not feel the prices are out of line. \n\nI made it my go to store for many Christmas gifts.  The store is filled a wide variety of useful items, and some not so much.  They have books, kitchen gadgets, hair bands, hats, home decor, and more. \n\nSome of my faves are the PUP items, made from the RCA dome roof, 317 t's, and Namaste eye pillows.  \n\nKeep coming back.  There is always something new and interesting!"}
{"input": "You know, all I did was stand in line to buy a suit for my little boy.  I realize the clothing is used and certainly don't expect it to be treated as a new buy.  All I needed was a hanger to hang the suit on so it wouldn't get wrinkled in the bag.  The older lady with glasses checking me out told me I could buy a hanger for the suit.  If I wasn't desperate, with a sick kid at home, whom I'm trying to nurse back to health for a piano recital tomorrow, I probably would have let this pass.  Saver's I hope a hanger was worth losing my future business.  I suggest you provide some kindness training for the rude and non-compassionate human you have working for you....Transaction 8797, register 7, operator 1515, 10:34a.  I'll go elsewhere next time where I can be treated with little kindness and respect."}
{"input": "The hot chicken is probably one of the best fried chickens I've ever eaten, and I'm from the South/NC and have had quite a bit of it. However, the price for the small portion size is really expensive. The drinks here are fantastic too."}
{"input": "Amazing! Get the sampler to try a bit of everything. The injera is a flatbread that is a really fun and traditional way to eat the food. People that don't like spicy food, fear not the food here is not crazy spicy. Please give this a go! Totally worth it!!"}
{"input": "Why don't we have a Target?  I thought K-Mart was going out of business.  Well not this one, this miserable son of a bitch refuses to die.  They had the audacity to try to update it.  It reminds me of Jack Palance its old, tired, and smells funny, but it ain't going know where.    I wish a shiny new Target would come along and stab this relic of a store through the heart with its superior retail sword.  I have experienced on no less than 5 occasions of a product being labeled as on sale only to be charged full price at the counter.  Then I have to stop the line to back to the aisle and grab the sign to show it to the cashier.  Once I bought a beach chair here, well my wife saw the dopeness of said chair and wanted to copy me.  I return to the store the next day (happened to be 80 degrees and sunny) and those SOB's raised the price of the chair $10.  I was pissed yo."}
{"input": "We had another outstanding meal at J Gilbert's. Sunday is half price wine night so we started with a great red wine. The calamari appetizer was tender and delicious. We ordered 2 versions of the filet combo. One with crab cake and one with scallops. Both were excellent. Grilled asparagus was perfect and the Lobster Mac and cheese and the au gratin potatoes were decadent sides. You can't go wrong with any of the entrees here. I do not know why it wasn't busier!"}
{"input": "My first time visiting this establishment and I must say I am truly satisfied with the food especially the garlic bread and jerk chicken pasta!!!! The best part is there is enough food to bring home for dinner for the next day! I can see myself being a regular over there!"}
{"input": "We've eaten here 3 times and it seems that each time it gets even better! I had the shrimp malabar the last time and it was like a spiritual experience. Wonderful! The Naan  is always good and the service is quite attentive. It's hard to believe that this place isn't packed every time we go since this area of NE is pretty sparse on Indian."}
{"input": "If you're entertained by gambling as an end in itself - if you enjoy spending an evening actually trying to win some money - Western Village is really one of the best places in Reno.\n\nFor example, there's a poker pay table \"10/7 Double Bonus Poker.\" that, if played perfectly, returns 100.7% of your money. Since casinos rarely like to lose money, it's extremely rare to run across. I found it at Western Village, on the 50-play machines. And they weren't even advertising it - they just slipped it in.\n\nSadly, I guess too many people caught on, and they eventually reduced it to 9/6/5 - which is still an almost 98-percent payback. Good enough that you really don't need to walk in expecting to lose.\n\nSame goes for the tables - you're usually going to find pretty much the least restrictive rules that you can find in a Nevada casino.\n\nThis place doesn't have a lot of glitz or glamour, it doesn't have much in the way of comps, but it's a great place to gamble."}
{"input": "I finally went to my first Phillies game and had a blast!!! \nCitizens Bank Park was beautiful. It was well lit and decorated with baseball history. There were great statues of various players surrounding the stadium. Much better than Lincoln Financial Field.\n\nOur seats were great and the fans were fun. The food was good but pricey as you would expect. \n\nI never watch baseball on tv because I get bored easily. There is so much going on at the stadium that I was never bored at all. The funny fans on camera were great and the energy was awesome. I loved that there was so much going on. Cant wait for my next game."}
{"input": "This review is only for the donuts and coffee. I selected the almond joy donut and iced vanilla latte. We came here based on all the reviews on Yelp and it could have been a miss due to the donut offerings of that day( 8 varieties: 4 specialties such as Neapolitan, late night snack, etc and 4 somewhat normal selections such as glaze, cinnamon roll, etc). I was looking for the Vietnamese coffee flavor or blueberry flavored donut but they didn't have either. \n\nThe almond joy donut was a disappointment. It tasted like any other donut I've tasted before. I was looking for more of a coconut and almond taste. The iced vanilla latte was okay as well."}
{"input": "We hit this place late night for dinner when we got back late from a tour. It was right near our hotel so that helped. The raw bar selections were very good, local oysters, giant shrimp and king crab. Service was excellent as well. The burger my wife and son split was good, but nothing to write home about but I wouldn't have come here for just that. Decent bar scene as well."}
{"input": "This place is a cafeteria diner. It reminds me of a soul food restaurant in Texas called Sweet Georgia Brown, but with better decor and facilities. You can walk through the line and select options for entree, sides and dessert. You may also order off the menu. We ordered, fried oysters, fried catfish, baked catfish, mashed potatoes, cabbage, broccoli, pasta side dish, roasted potatoes and green beans. Cornbread was extra at 75 cents. Everything was delicious except the fried oysters. The batter used for the oysters was different than that used for the catfish. The oyster was more battered versus breaded. If the batter for the oysters was the same as the catfish, they probably would have tasted great. Dinner with one entree and 2- meat platter was $13.99 with 2 sides.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit for delicious food."}
{"input": "I ordered a BLT from here and it came with bacon crumbles on my sandwich. It was also made with shredded lettuce. So the sandwich was just falling out all over the place. I mean who makes a BLT with crumbled bacon? I would have never ordered that if they told me before. I returned the sandwich and didnt order any further food. Wont order from here. Ever again."}
{"input": "Don't be fooled by the outside of this restaurant. The inside is absolutely gorgeous and pristine. I have not had the hibachi yet, but plan to because the sushi and overall experience at Kuchi has been fantastic in every way.  The sushi is so delicious and most importantly fresh! The beauty of the plating is what makes the experience even more memorable. I have been here many times now and it has only been open a couple of months. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive.  I would urge everyone to come here. I have travelled to 17 countries and this is one of my favorite restaurants overall anywhere."}
{"input": "I love the atmosphere in Hyde Perk not only do I love being in the north end but this little coffee shop is so comfortable and relaxing. Its quiet at just the right times and I love their friendly staff. I tried their Kombucha it was a blueberry flavor and it was so tasty! Definitely going back to study or just hang out with close friends!"}
{"input": "We liked this theatre the last time we visited but noticed the cleanliness wasn't up to snuff, this was in November 2016. I took the family back for an early matinee and I found the bathrooms  disgusting! I took photos due to another 2 people entering and turning around and leaving the bathroom due to the filth. I talked to R****ll and showed him the photos. His response to me was \"They are like that a lot because people trash them.\" The management needs to go through some serious training classes. This AMC is losing their good clientele due to not keeping cleanliness standards higher. I don't want to know about the food items. We wont be back."}
{"input": "We have been coming here for a couple of years.. but the last three things at this location things have gotten progressively worse.. we came here this last week and was greeted and sat.. the waiter took our order for hummus and beer and pizza.. after a wait(I know how much it takes being here before) we got our pizza and beer but no hummus.. had to ask for napkins.. then I asked for a to go beer(I love New Orleans) but after a 10 minute wait no beer.. at least they didn't charge us for it..so we left.. and we won't be back sadly.. we used to love this place but we will take our business elsewhere"}
{"input": "Fast friendly service.  The omelets are huge!  Coffee was delicious.  Would definetly come back again,"}
{"input": "I have been to many hamburger places from California to Tennessee and by far this place is the best I have had.  Try the tots!  Staff is si friendly and quick.  The mixture of the meats is the answer."}
{"input": "Great service, excellent food! We were visiting Nashville and lucky to have found this place for lunch!"}
{"input": "Cool mom & pop Greek spot. Great breskfasts, greek salads, friendly, oersonsl service. Ssk for Jufy"}
{"input": "Love, Love, LOVE this store!!!  I admit, I'm an addict. But where else can you get a Bebe top, a Banana Republic skirt and a BCBG skirt for $4.13?????  The savings are ridiculous!"}
{"input": "We had a mixed experience at Mr. B's.  We started at the bar for drinks and a starter due to table wait. Bar was nice for a busy night. Our table was ready early so the bar staff transferred our starter to the table and things went down hill quickly. Starters were delivered and then we were ignored for over 45 minutes. No drinks, water etc. Finally a waiter in another section took out order. We ordered BBQ shrimp (best thing on our table), rabbit and wood plank grilled fish. Fish was a very small piece and not worth the $$$. Rabbit was good! Hit and miss service ruined the experience."}
{"input": "Having lived within walking distance of Chinatown for 20 years, we were thrilled to find such amazing food in Elkins Park.  And they will spice up anything.  Love their sesame chicken, hot (have to ask), and crab Rangoon, and moo shoo anything!!  Specials are great too!  Only downside is no delivery but pickup is prompt and plenty of parking."}
{"input": "We went to the Tyrone location after visiting the Sarasota location many times.The Tyrone location is beautifully decorated, the staff very friendly, and the food delicious. We went on a Friday night and the restaurant was very busy, but we got seated right away. Although the Sarasota location is closer to our home...we will be back to the Tyrone location. While the Sarasota location is perfectly good...the Tyrone location has a bit more going on."}
{"input": "This place is okay as long as you know what to order. Steaks, chicken, and sandwiches are okay, everything else needs to improve. I am not rating desert here, since these are a safe bet.\n\nParking at this place is rough, the service is pretty good and makes up for this.  I generally only eat lunch here because the place is not worth the hassle of a dinner crowd.\n\nWhile I do not go out of my way to go to any Outback, this one is a better one.  Also this location really tries to make improvements and make your experience enjoyable, but the food is average at best."}
{"input": "Great late night spot for dancing! There isn't much to the place - pretty divey but great drinks and great live entertainment. Ladies keep an eye on your bags here - my friends phone, id, credit & debit cards were stolen here. The bathrooms weren't to gross here compared to some of the other places...And be aware of the shot girls that come around and push shots in your mouth and then you have to pay for them!! We didn't even ask for them!!!! Then they demanded $72 from us. We were there for like 3 minutes when that happened. ha. Then kept coming over to us like we were suckers. Fool us once, shame on us....fool us twice....."}
{"input": "My first time coming here was super awesome. So I decide to bring my Mom for my second visit. Unfortunately I was so disappointed and mad that I took my mom here for lunch. We waited for about an hour for our food and they even manage to messed it up.\n\nMight come back for the drinks but not for the food."}
{"input": "Friday, July 22 we decided to give this eatery a try.  It is definitely in a great location especially if you want to explore the Quarter afterwards.  We were a party of 8 people and out of the 8 dishes ordered only 2 were really good --the jambalaya and file gumbo were very tasty.  The other dishes --red beans/rice,  meatloaf, Mac and cheese,  shrimp po boy, and chicken wings were bland and a waste of money.  The staff was nice but overall the food was mediocre."}
{"input": "Went there for brunch today. Unfortunately, the person assigned to the omelet station had no idea how to cook AND she was sooooooo slow.  She overcooked every omelet and could not handle a two burner station."}
{"input": "We were visiting from LA and found Crazy Sushi on Yelp. Probably the best presentation of Sushi I have seen. We ordered sashimi, a peacock roll and unagi...delicious!"}
{"input": "I told my brother I'd pick up the bill for two new tires that two different mechanics told him he needed for his car. But they told him they would only have to replace one and they could rearrange the tires on the car and then do a realignment to save him (me) $$. Estimate was $240. They completed the job in 3 hours and told him they didn't have to realign much and only charged him (again me) $133. Doesn't get more honest than that. This is the place to get your tires folks!"}
{"input": "Wow.  I have to say incredible.  We've driven by the place several times and always had that \"meh' attitude because of how the plaza looks.  Since the wife was craving some crispy duck it came up as having the best reviews for it.\n  Walking in, was a great traditional indian/thai setting with a comfortable small raunt demeanor.  We tried the mussel appetizer, while the wife got the Tamarind Duck and I tried the Panang Curry with calamari.\n  Service was prompt, quick and non invasive.  Mussels were tasty, but the Duck and Curry were to die for!  Portion sizes are definitely reflective of the prices so don't feel like you are going to get gyped.\n  We will be back to at least try the sushi or get more duck seeing as they have at least 2 more styles of it.\n  Happy tastebuds!"}
{"input": "I came here in a group and they were very nice about accommodating all of us. I loved their basil ginger lemonade, which had just the right amount of sugar.\nWe shared a bunch of appetizers and two pizzas and everything was rather tasty. I enjoyed the meatballs too! Nothing was particularly memorable but it was a pleasant time and the patio looks like a lovely place to chill on a spring/summer night."}
{"input": "My parents and I were looking for a quick meal of Ukrainian food and thought to check out Uncle Ed's.  I hadn't been here in years.\n\nMy mother's tomato soup and ham sandwich were delicious, the sauerkraut perogies and cabbage rolls were very good.  Dad and I are very happy.\n\nOur waitress was very pleasant.  The service was fast and the price is fantastic!"}
{"input": "Great happy hour.  And brunch.  Only had dinner there once and it was only OK- probably because I ordered something I don't typically eat.  It'll definitely try it again."}
{"input": "When I received my to-go order, I asked for a couple cups of water and tomato sauce.  The cashier said he needed to first take care of customers waiting to order, and he would call our number later.  Even after we finished our food 40 minutes later, we never heard him calling again.  I think we deserve better when we ordered $35 worth of food."}
{"input": "As a half Italian former New Yorker I grew up on Italian food.  It's all about the sauce or \" gravy\" and Ralph's did not disappoint. Our service was all business but opened up a little as the meal went on. Most people would complain but I liked the guy. I ordered the veal parm and loved it. Massive portion. The mussels in red sauce were delicious and the tiramisu was possibly the best I've ever had"}
{"input": "This place is worth a visit! We got in line about 30 min before the 5pm show and were in the first standing row so we could see the musicians play the whole time. We entered at 5pm (cash only $15-20 per person) and they played from 5:15-6pm. The musicians were friendly and played great music. The show is a little pricey but it goes to a good cause and it's neat to be in a space with so much history. Go if you can and be ready to stand! You can also buy tickets online that are more expensive but they reserve a seat for you if standing isn't your thing. Also I think the first 30 folks or so in line got seats as well. Kids sit on cushions in the front."}
{"input": "Absolutely amazing breakfast. I left feeling full but not weighted down with crappy food. Jordan was waiting the tables and OMG, the guy is on it and super friendly. This place comes highly recommended."}
{"input": "This place is so lovely! I went for a sweet and was amazed at the variety. The gooey butter cookies were awesome and the German chocolate cupcake simply amazing!"}
{"input": "Sandwiches and sides during lunch were OK but we had poor service. After our server delivered our food he never did check back with us. Finally had to flag him down to get what we needed. In the past Cheddar's was enjoyable but the last few visits haven't been."}
{"input": "This is the best italian restaurant in the area.  The food is delicious and steaming hot!  The portions are plentiful.  They're Margherita pizza is the best !  The service is excellent and the all the staff are very friendly.   We LOVE IT HERE!!! And it's BYOB"}
{"input": "Pulled pork sandwich was Delicious .. BUT! The lucky bun (Asian fusion style ) burger . Was a disappointment for the sole purpose of them using a frozen beef patty :/  the bread was good .. The toppings and sauces were great .. But just killed the flavors with a processed frozen beef patty .. If used a fresh ground meat .. It would have been a great gourmet burger .."}
{"input": "There's a lot to like about this restaurant. I love the location and the historic building. There is a great outdoor patio in summer. Brunch is very good. Went there for dinner during the Christmas season and it was cozy, festive, friendly. The food was very good. As good a steak as I have had anywhere in St. Louis. Will go back. Sorry it is not a little closer to the Clayton area."}
{"input": "If you have a free afternoon while visiting Santa Barbara, check this place out! One of those places when you step in the door, you instantly feel like you're on vacation. It's warm, inviting atmosphere is so comfortable you'll want to take a nap in front of the fire after a glass of wine. There's a fireplace in the corner with a cozy set-up, you'll swear you're in a living room of a snug b&b. Also, a bar where you can sit and speak with one of the knowledgable and friendly members of their staff about what kind of wine you'd like to try.\n\nGreat place for a date, girls night or if you want to have a wine tasting experience in a great atmosphere. They offer several different tasting flights of wine (and beer) for a really reasonable price. If you're a regular, look into getting a membership. I spent hours here with a friend sipping wine and relaxing. A must see spot if you like great wine and conversation.\n\nFavorites: \nDiamond Flight\nGold Flight\nThe cozy fireplace :)"}
{"input": "Cute interior and owner (?) gave us tour of upcoming patio/rooftop area which will be great on beautiful days like today. Cheese curds were very good and very filling. Really like that sandwiches come w salad, esp after eating too many curds! Had the onion, gruyere, tomato sandwich. Wasn't too much cheese which I liked. Needed something else...pepper jelly maybe. Would like to see more menu options added such as salads w fun cheeses. Lots of beer and wine as well as limited cocktails. Next time I will try one of the draft wines."}
{"input": "Stopped in for lunch and had the special which was the LaPlaya and also had the Couchon which were both delicious in their own flavors.  The beef and shrimp were very fresh.  I was also able to try the con queso which was one of the best con quesos I have had in a while.  The chips were crunchy and hot.  The styling of the plate and presentation was unique.  Great waiters. Small venue but very nice.  I'll definitely be going back at some point for Happy Hour."}
{"input": "Had a great view but too many plants in the Windows. Large seating dining broke up into sections around a large bar area. Very nice atmosphere. Friendly staff. Large menu. My hubby ordered the Ribeye and fries. They seasoned and cooked it perfectly. I ordered the chicken carbonara. Unfortunately it's without the egg but was very good anyway. They don't serve bread nor salad with the pasta dishes. The steak came with salad. Their gooey cake is a must."}
{"input": "Three chances and they are out! We tried to like this place as the location is easy and convenient. The bar is great, the staff friendly, but there is not a dish I have tried that is passable (although the asian shrimp wasn't bad, but very sweet). First visit we wrote off as a new restaurant working out the bugs. On our second visit I ordered a turkey burger and received a dry turkey patty. No one informed me that they were out of buns, but they could have at least tried to dress it up. It was seriously a lone piece of ground meat (to their credit, the manager did comp that meal). Today we received fish and chips that had to come out of a box and chicken salad that could have greased my axles!\n\nWe won't be back."}
{"input": "We just had a drink and dessert here. My husband had the fried pie. It was apple. He said it was too much like Mickey D's....and that it needed  some cinnamon. I had the ice cream sandwich which was a sugar cookie with vanilla ice cream and marshmallows. It was good."}
{"input": "Amazing atmosphere! Bartenders, Alana and Graham, were awesome. The cauliflower buffalo bites were great and the craft drinks delicious."}
{"input": "10 bucks per person to play as long as they are open no coins or tokens required. Several arcade games, most of the different gaming consoles, and board games for people to play. I took my boys here for a couple hours and they had a great time ... I was a little disappointed that there was only one pinball machine and it didn't work. They have some video games for sale and they also sell beverages. Not a bad or expensive place to take the kids... would be awesome if the had one of these in Greenwood..,"}
{"input": "Always a quick response! Very polite and knowledgeable. Great value. Chris seems to be \"our\" heating and cooling guy, he's the one that always comes to our house. We do schedule maintenance spring and fall. Three (?) years ago after our check, (one of the VERY hot summers) our upstairs AC had problems, they checked it, had leak and was low on freon. It was \"fixed\" to work for that day/night. A new one was put in the next day, if not, the next. They don't try to push anything or sell you more than you need."}
{"input": "Tried the cheesesteak, Italian hoagie and mozzarella fries. All were delicious and the price is reasonable. Nice people too-I asked for a to-go box for the rest of my hoagie and they wrapped it up for me and put it in a bag. Wasn't expecting that from a walk in pizza place. Overall, great food and great service."}
{"input": "I stopped in with a few co workers on our lunch break... The service was terrible and the food wasn't all that great. Everything took way too long. My coworker asked for no cilantro and she got extra. Not a good place to stop on a lunch break when you need to be in the office in an hour. Also the restaurant smells very authentic... I still smell like lunch."}
{"input": "We don't eat here often as it is over priced for what you really get. I tried this store last night Friday 1/27/2017. I liked our server Tikel he did everything he could to make our dinner special. The food was nothing special and the kitchen was very slow last night. Tikel came and checked in with us during our wait  which was 45 minutes between our salad before the rest of our meal arrived, I would have had dessert but ran out of wait time and we had to go. Where was the manager last night she passed by our table at least five times and would not even give us even eye contact. There are better values out there than this, I would recommend other places in this area."}
{"input": "This location has its good and it's bad.\n\nGood:\n1. Generally friendly staff.\n2. Good location.\n3. Good gun pricing randomly.\n4. Online pickup is wonderful!\n5. Interesting layout, very open.\n6. They carry a few things Bass Pro and Cabela's doesn't.\n\nBad:\n1. It's not very organized.\n2. Finding staff can be difficult sometimes.\n3. West County Mall parking can be a major pain in the arse.\n4. Non-sale items are always a bit overpriced.\n\nOverall I still go, but if I find a better option, I'm taking it."}
{"input": "Great pizza pie.  Stellar crust and ingredients, not overcooked.\n\nThe place is stylish but fun.  The HVAC is poorly designed (causing drafts where seats next to each other vary wildly in comfort).\n\nWorse, the service is a mess.  When we finally got a waitress, she was great; but there was much confusion getting one in the first place.  I think they can earn that last star and a place among my favourites as they work out these kinks.  The &#960; is worth it."}
{"input": "If you want a great atmosphere that is different from any other restaurant.  Great drinks and strangely awesome food. My girlfriend and I love this place. Perfect date night"}
{"input": "I hate to give bad reviews, but I was not a fan of their ONE vegan dish (called \"The Vegan\" if I remember correctly). It was served drenched in a soggy brown liquid that was really too salty to even eat. I love salt, and that just straight up hurt my tongue. I have been to lots of \"Steakhouse\"-type restaurants that do a lot better with their vegan options. Please consider adding more items that are less salty and sad-looking."}
{"input": "Great beer, delicious food. Was pleasantly surprised to find a fruity beer on the menu, and it was raspberry. Wings had good flavor. We couldn't make up our minds on the burgers so we got two and each had a half. I did not want to give up the other half of the Bang Bang burger. It was so damn good! The Fire Starter was no joke. Holy hot! Get the beer battered fries, they're great."}
{"input": "Very unique pizza topping combinations--everything from your average pepperoni and cheese to Thai peanut shrimp and Buffalo chicken. Plenty of TVs and beer for sports fans."}
{"input": "I eat here every Wednesday and never get tired of it! They have the friendliest staff and best sandwiches. :)\n\nI always order the veno with pepperchinis added and a cup of their potato soup - yum!"}
{"input": "Their attention to providing many, many yummy gluten-free options is a huge plus!\nThere are many places on the Western Main Line to enjoy Sunday brunch and Em J's is as good or better than most if not all.\nThe vast gluten-free alternatives puts them head above shoulders for those who must or choose to avoid gluten.\nGood job Em J's!!!!!"}
{"input": "Honestly this is my favorite place to get pizza but there are a few little issues that keeps me from giving it 5 stars. One is how much everything costs, it is worth it but I still feel like the only reason why I don't order there often is that sometimes the good stuff is around $30 for one pizza. My other reason is that sometimes the food will get to you undercooked and that is based on how many toppings it has since they seem to put  all the food items in the same oven for the same amount of time."}
{"input": "Pretty typical fare. Nothing exciting or innovative, but nothing too bad or expensive either. Went for dinner one Saturday and got a nice fried flounder platter with veggies. The asparagus was pretty puny, and the waitress forgot to bring it out originally. The music was so loud, you'd think you were at a club.\n\nThere are many better options and I'd recommend most of them, but going to the Marathon Grill on 10th and Walnut isn't the end of the world. Just don't go to the one on Chestnut. That is possibly the worst place ever. But that's another review entirely."}
{"input": "A neat old building with a history in the heart of the French Quarter.  I have had a few things off the menu and have never been disappointed, but I come back for the Turtle Soup.  It is the best I've had in the city.  Bartenders are friendly and the drinks are reasonably priced.  \n\nYou can  get in and out for lunch under $25. A alcoholic beverage, soup and half loaf of bread will run about $19."}
{"input": "Good solid food.  I enjoy lunch here at least once a week.    If you are in the Cummins Station area get lunch here.   Good food, good service."}
{"input": "Their bobba is amazing! All of the food I've tried is exquisite and reasonably priced, I would definitely recommend eating here and trying some of their food."}
{"input": "Our food was delicious!! The brussel sprouts appetizer was to die for. We also shared the crawfish bisque and the shrimp and grits, which were both delicious as well. I would recommend both!! We made a reservation, which I would recommend doing as well. The service was very friendly, polite, and helpful. I only wish we had more money to spend on food!"}
{"input": "Great place to grab amazing sliders, cheese fries and wonderful donuts. I had a BLT slider...pork heaven. Cheese fries are a must.  Comes with friends that like to share because it is too hard to pick just one donut."}
{"input": "Finally....a Dominican restaurant in Center City or at least close to Center City.  I had the opportunity to try this restaurant last Saturday with a group of friends (25) for a birthday celebration.  \n\nThe owner was more than helpful in accommodating such a large party.  I can't review   the service in general since this was a unique situation but everyone working there went above and beyond and the service for our party was exceptional.\n\nThe atmosphere is bright, simple and pleasant.  \n\nThe stuffed plantain was amazing.  If you like plantains don't miss it.\n\nThe steak was a bit tough but the chicken was moist and flavorful. \n\nThe prices are very reasonable.\n\nThis place is new and still finding its stride, but the owners are very committed to their business and I have no doubt they will continue to refine the overall experience."}
{"input": "Freaking Gem!! Ran into this place on our fourth time in NOLA.  The drinks are great!  Walk right in!  A+"}
{"input": "The food was good and the atmosphere was great.  I really wanted to like Sukho Thai, but the service was absolutely horrible.  The woman working there seemed genuinely angry that we would dare eat at her restaurant.  The dessert was good too, but if you order some, prepare for the wrath of the hostess.  It seemed to make her furious that not only did we eat dinner there, but we were also deliberately wasting even more of her time by being so inconsiderate as to order a dessert as well."}
{"input": "I came here for my birthday dinner, and the waitress was very forgetful and basically sucked. We brought a bottle of tequila for margaritas and I am almost certain the waitress stole a nice amount of it, (the bottle was returned with 1/6th left and we only had two pitchers) and the two waitresses were acting drunk when we left. Good food, poor service"}
{"input": "We have always been a fan of this restaurant. We come here every summer when we are here. Our previous visit was a disaster, but the owner made an effort to reach out to us and have us come back since they were in a stage of transition. On this visit the food was great the service was wonderful and the atmosphere is definitely very upbeat and obviously very popular with a lot of other people now. My wife and I had fish tacos and shrimp tacos, and they were great. Once again, this has become a summer favorite."}
{"input": "I cannot day enough good things about this place. I have been to various markets all around the world and Mazzaro's falls in my top 3. The prices are ridiculously inexpensive and everything tastes amazing. It's hard to rope yourself in from not buying everything. The bakery cookies are fresh and different from others in the area and the meal options such as anti pasta or even the veal Park taste just like your grandma made it. Aces and a must visit if you are visiting in town."}
{"input": "Wow!  What a surprise.  He let us try the sides.  We liked them all.  Then I ordered the pulled pork sandwich.  Then he let us try the pork steak.  I thought wow, I should have got the pork steak.  Then I had my sandwich and it was so good I didn't feel I missed out on the steak so much.  My wife and really loved this place.  The guy was real nice too.  We sat out on the picnic table which was fine."}
{"input": "Not many places are willing to accommodate dogs that can't place nice with others. They give her special one on one playtime (or with her buddy when I had two that played well). \n\nAlso very few places offer the extended hours, even weekends, and especially without charging for the entire day. Worth the extra price to know she's been attended to, not just fed and crated like at the vet."}
{"input": "Went to see Anders Osborne play here & it was a highlight of my trip to NOLA.  Streetcar went straight down to Bourbon after the show but I wish I'd stayed longer! Food smelled awesome, drinks were very reasonably priced  & the crowd was mellow."}
{"input": "Fantastic restaurant located in the the heart of Jacksons square! The ambience was very classy. A bit pricey but, worth the experience. We opted for the pre-fixed menu, which included an appetizer, entree with about 5 different options and a desert. After dinner we took a trip upstairs where it is very eclectic. Although there is no food or beverage service on the patio, you can order a cocktail down stairs, and enjoy it on the patio over looking Jackson Square!"}
{"input": "Excellent tasting food and great service. Best burgers and pulled pork we have had in reno/sparks area.  It will now be our new spot"}
{"input": "It's a clean gym, with an ok vibe, the locker rooms are large and clean, and the staff is cool and helpful."}
{"input": "Bunch of high school/college kids running the place. The food is decent, but just decent. 50% chance they will mess up your order in some capacity..."}
{"input": "Went here last week on my first trip to New Orleans.  It's a very fancy place, although my friends and I were in t-shirts.  The atmosphere is great, and the food was very good.  Since I was in N.O., I wanted to eat seafood and other traditional Cajun fare.  As I suspect most people do, I ordered the 3-course meal for $30.  The fried gator tail appetizer was very good, not too much breading.  I also tasted my friend's seafood gumbo, which was also quite good.  For my main course, I had the seafood au gratin, which was extremely rich (and very tasty).  I also tasted a friend's shrimp creole, which was only ok.  The bread pudding desert was excellent (very dense).  My friend ordered the brownie - don't waste your time.  All-in-all, I left with a full stomach of very good Louisiana food at a reasonable price."}
{"input": "It's nice to have a decent culinary option in NE, but I hear folks talking about this place like it is the second coming of Christ!\n\nThe duck fries were some of best fries I've ever had.  Get them, won't disappoint. The duck sandwich and pork roll burger were both bland and barely mediocre. Salads were grossly overdressed.   \n\nI'd try it again if I were in the NE."}
{"input": "Natural Cafe is one of the best restaurants for vegetarians.  Their Buddha burritos and Falafel pitas are among my favorites. Their new location at Camino Real marketplace is great too,  although the older one at Old Town was more classic.  \n\nThe reason I gave 3 stars instead of a 4.5 or 5 was because of a few ridiculous rules they have.  First,  they regularly email discount coupons but want them to be printed in order to avail the discounts.  I find this very silly.  The name of the restaurant is Natural Cafe and they have messages all over the place to protect the environment.  But it's strange that they need a paper printout and don't allow if we show them the email in the phone. \n\nSecond,  they are also very strict with timings.  If you come around the closing time (9 PM), they just keep showing at the table to get you out.  The older place at Old Town was more relaxed with the timings. \n\nI would have given a higher rating of not for these absurd rules.  The food here is still one of the best."}
{"input": "Had a spare moment before getting my hair done so I stopped at Tebella for a snack. I was pleasantly surprised by the quaint little shop. I ordered the Key Lime Mocktail and the chocolate chip scone. The handcrafted tea took about 5 minutes to make but was amazing! Not too sweet and the perfect amount of lime. I ate the scone while I waited and it was perfection! I wish I'd ordered 2. Great little spot. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"input": "This place was soooo unexpectedly delicious!! We had Charred Carrot Hummus, Shabazi Fries, Bean Fattoush, Roasted Cauliflower and the Bean Tagine. Every dish was flavorful, inventive, fresh and amazing!! Kudos to the chef and owner!! Definitely coming back."}
{"input": "I personally prefer a clean broth without too much spices or herbs so it's hard for me to find the right pho.  I tried about 5 other places before stumbled upon this one 3 months ago.  Wanted to try several times before writing a review since consistency is important. Their broth is awesome. Enough flavors to keep digging in, tender meats, fresh munk beans, basil and not so quick yet efficient service. I also tried their charbroiled pork (#44) and it's really good. Just right. I wish the place is a tad cleaner, hence 4 stars, rather than 5. Overalls, it is a great place if you're in the mood for pho."}
{"input": "Pita Pit is one of those places that you crave about once a year, and after obtaining the food that you have been craving all day, realize why it's been so long since you last ate here.  It's just not that good.\n\n$8.47 for one pita delivered.\n\nDelivery times are pretty quick, and if you go inside they will make your food right away, but that doesn't mean it tastes good,  That simply means if you're hungry, go ahead and eat here.\n\nThey have different meats, veggies, and cheeses to fill your pita with, including (bad) gyro meat.  They also have tzatziki sauce to complete my favorite wrap, although the gyro's here are not good and I don't suggest getting one.\n\nI'd rather go here than Subway but since I hate Subway, this really isn't saying much."}
{"input": "Super cute place! Came during lunch and I had the fig salad and it was really good although I'd probably ask for the dressing on the side next time since it was a bit much for me. Would definitely go again for another day date!"}
{"input": "The parking lot and the people surrounding it is a little scary.\n\nThe store is limited in my opinion. Definitely has its pros and cons. I found out there is an app u can download to load digital coupons by that seems like it's all the perks they have.\n\nI was impressed that my nagger asked if I would like to have him load my bags in my car. Haven't had someone ask me that in a grocery store ever!\n\nThey have the BEST fried chicken but when I got home I didn't think mine was very fresh like I'm  used to. Granted it was almost closing time they should have had it discounted in my opinion."}
{"input": "There is no denying that this place is fabulous! Service is excellent. We went for a group event with a set menu. They chicken dish was amazing. I don't think others liked the lobster risotto as much. The calamari and hummus and risotto balls were also great. The panacotta dessert was to die for."}
{"input": "It's cool and it's free... why not check it out?  They change the content frequently and have a great show for the end of year holidays.  I guess the only downside is it can get extremely packed and seating is limited.  Get their early unless you don't mind standing or sitting on the floor."}
{"input": "Tanti and Papertini are AMAZING!!!! My wedding was fabulously decorated, the flowers were beautiful, everything was more perfect than I had imagined. The amount of compliments that I received about the decor, the ambiance, the special touches that Tanti created were so many I couldn't even count them! She and her team turned a nice space into OUR beautiful space. I cannot say enough about how awesome they are."}
{"input": "The restaurant is beautiful and food is amazing.  I purchased red snapper bento box and it is a generous portion. Staff is very friendly."}
{"input": "Bailey's Range has interesting burgers for any type of person. All the food is good and so are the drinks and milkshakes! The service at the Range has always been phenomenal for me, very friendly and efficient."}
{"input": "REALLY below average food.  Akin to waffle house.  I wanted this to be good based on the reviews but not so.  The pancakes tasted like a frozen processed version, \"homemade\" maple syrup was watery/sugary with fake flavoring.  Trees make authentic syrup, not people.  The hash browns were greasy and fairly tasteless. The bacon overcooked, hard and chewy.  Obviously had been sitting awhile. Overall, very uninspired food.  Unfortunately, this is one of those places that is living on an outdated \"must go\" reputation.  There are much better offerings in Nashville."}
{"input": "Good food, reasonably priced, and nice staff. Not ideal for eating in, but since they are going for a fast food approach to vegan food, that makes a lot of sense. I know the buffalo bella is the dish that they push the hardest, but for my money the Cheesesteak is the way to go. And pro-tip: Get the sweet potato fries."}
{"input": "Always a pleasure to come here. Relaxing and such a great pedicure. They make you feel so relaxed while pampering you."}
{"input": "This is absolutely my favorite studio in STL (no disrespect to the others; they are great as well, just not #1 in my book).  Roxanne is AWESOME- wonderful studio space, the people who come here are generally super nice as well, great instruction.. Made me feel right at home. I love that she teaches advanced poses but also makes it so a modified version is easily accessible.\n\nPracticing Yoga is a solid 20 min drive from my house, but totally worth it every time!"}
{"input": "Yummy Sushi for a good price!!  The whole familly LOVES it here and the friends i have sent over there weren't diappionted and have become regulars too. Great customer service everytime we go. And if you have a person in your party who doesn NOT want sushi, they can order chinese food from Asian Wok (next door) Works for parents with Non sushi eating kids!! =)"}
{"input": "Had a great lunch here. I ordered a chicken Caesar and my dining companion ordered a custom salad. Waitress had a great personality and did not rush us at all. Allowed us to linger. Great space which is hidden from the outside."}
{"input": "Super sweetheart of a lady working there (along with the rest of them old gals) that even had the back take the time to remove fruits from the fruit medley that i didnt like. Had a quick to go order that hit the spot. Not my cup of tea design-wise, but i'm sure it handles what it handles. Very at-home feel."}
{"input": "Nice creamy product with unusual flavors but the prices are pretty high if you are planning on taking the family. Two of us got two scoops in a cup and it cost us almost $20."}
{"input": "Smith's Bar and Restaurant is well priced and had great service.  We were very pleased with our easier who took no time at all to give us our bill. The menu doesn't have the most unique options, but the food itself is different.  Try the flat bread pizza which is extremely thin making it fun to eat.  Their chopped salad is wholesome and coherent; each spoonful is a perfect blend of different flavors (unlike one of those large pieces of lettuce that take up an entire bite). You also can't beat $4.00 mimosas."}
{"input": "We really liked this place. Everything we had was delicious. Portions were big. Chicken parm was so yummy. Can't wait to go back and try more stuff !"}
{"input": "Discovered this place while searching Yelp for something else and I'm SO glad I did. Went today for the first time. It's so fantastic.  I had the chicken tacos (I'm hoping and suggested they try a steak option), and my friend had the gazpacho shrimp soup-I think it's a soup. Anyway, both meals were delicious. I couldn't even come close to eating all 3 tacos but they were super yummy."}
{"input": "The family run place is amazing. Great service and great food that is all cooked to order. Be aware the mild is on the spicer end, so be mindful when ordering."}
{"input": "The food is expensive and subpar and the drinks are the size of a vegas bomb. Save your money."}
{"input": "We went here for dinner and it was fairly busy, although reservations were not necessary.  Inside it looks more of a classy place.  But sadly, that was the best part of our experience.   Our waiter Mike was just unprofessional, a tad snooty, and slow.  He has a hard time understanding what customer service is, and he tries to push unwanted items from the menu on you.  Maybe he should pay more attention to his customers instead of relaying heavily on the bussers.  They were great.  They brought the bread, the served the food, they kept the glasses filled, and they picked up the plates.  All Mike did was take our order, disappear during the entire meal, and then make us wait a good 10 minutes to bring the check.   \n\nAs for the food, it was just okay.  It was hot and fresh, but on the bland side.  Neither myself or my friend finished our meals.  \n\nThis place is more show than substance.  There are plenty of other Italian places in this city.  I recommend trying somewhere else."}
{"input": "Friendly helpful staff. Knowledgeable about their products. Delicious gelato and popcorn"}
{"input": "AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE!! I have never gotten extensions before or been in a beauty supply store so I was nervous because I don't know anything about extensions. I was blown away by Aaliyah (hope I spelled her name correctly). She was soo friendly and helpful!! She helped me find the right color I needed and I left feeling happy."}
{"input": "So beautiful and great trails to hike.  Very clean even with so much foot, bike and horse traffic.  Every area is scenic and amazing. Such a Tucson gem."}
{"input": "We like the food here. I had the borsetti: it was creamy and simply delicious. The waitress was very friendly. It probably helped that the restaurant was almost empty... One of my favourite places to eat!"}
{"input": "Really expensive and the food proportions were small. I gave it 2 stars because of the location. But other than that I think there are better sushi restaurants out there this one. Plus, no parking around this place."}
{"input": "Very nice place, fast service, got our beers quick, patio is cool as hell, it was cheap. No complaints. Good ass place."}
{"input": "Absolutely amazing!! Cute little restaurant serving breakfast and brunch. They have a bunch of unique and tasty mimosas. Super cool atmosphere and decor. Food was extremely tasty. Awesome find during our short stay in Tucson!"}
{"input": "Friday night staff was friendly.\n\nThey have all your basics. \nPlus hotdogs, funnel cake, and churros.\n\nPrice was right."}
{"input": "Big fan of this place. They have the best sugar cookies and butter cake. (Although the butter cake starts getting stale within hours so eat it fast) They are always so nice; gave a cookie to my daughter today while we waited in line. Most importantly, I just leaned they make breakfast sandwiches on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. They are excellent and come with western potatoes and a croissant. You can see one half of a breakfast sandwich in my picture. All of this for just $6.99. A very good value considering their normal bakery items are a bit expensive - but worth it."}
{"input": "Mirna's is a great neighborhood-y restaurant. I'm always a sucker for a good BYOB and they have very friendly staff, generous portions, and pretty tasty food. I find their menu to be sort of alarmingly lengthy (which doesn't exactly lead me to believe anything is super fresh), but lots of options are probably a selling point for most people and as I mentioned above, the food still tastes good. I like the grilled squid appetizer and a number of their pastas. I've ordered a blackened fish dish from time to time and found it to be quite good as well."}
{"input": "Phenomenal restaurant. Great location. Great ambience.  Great food and most of all great drinks. If you go, grab a seat at the  bar. Jared is a true mixologist and has created all of the cocktails on the menu. Don't be afraid to challenge him. As for food, I have never had a bad meal and I have had 100's at this point and pretty much everything on the menu. You won't go wrong with anything on the menu. Listen for the specials...they are always wonderful."}
{"input": "We shop at acme pretty frequently. Today, we accidentally left a bag with a good amount of food in it at the self check out (pasta salad, cheese, etc). We noticed the moment we got home and immediately returned to the store. I also tried calling customer service twice to let them know and it just rang, and rang, and rang with no answer. \n\nWell, when we got back - they were already reshelving our items! My husband had to go around the store and track everything down. \n\nAre you freaking kidding me? You're telling me that they don't even wait for people to return before putting PURCHASED items back to sell AGAIN? There's seriously not a location where they put these items to give the buyers a chance to return?! \n\nIt was honestly a span of 20 minutes. That's ridiculous."}
{"input": "What an odd place.  The decor is over-the-top trendy and shabby chic - calling it a blend of style would be like calling a train wreck a multi-media art project.  \n\nTheir clientele that night was a gaggle of hammered redneck contractors.  And I really mean hammered and I really mean redneck:  think of a caricature of Larry the Cable Guy after a 5th of crappy bourbon.\n\nAnd here's an odd turn... they were playing vintage live Bob Marley shows.  I don't object at all, it was just really out-of-place.\n\nAlso, get ready to spend $15 for a martini.  Oh wow, am I in a cool DC lounge?  Nope, I've got team Realtree sitting across from me in a gaudy velvet chair.\n\nHowever... if peyote is your thing, I bet this place would visually send you to the moon."}
{"input": "Staples is great. They have a huge selection of office supplies for great prices. \n\nI don't know why I think office supplies are so cool but I love going to these stores and checking out cool pens or notepads and buying them for absolutely no reason. Staples also carries good office furniture that is frequently placed on sale so you can get great bargains when setting up your home office. \n\nIt's also a really great place for back to school shopping supplies."}
{"input": "Love this bucks but the blonde with the red lips has a little bit of an attitude she might need to check...."}
{"input": "I went  to Cafe at the Square 4 years ago. Someone was recently asking me about the wet food in New Orleans and I had to let them know to visit this place!!! They have the BEST fried green tomatoes!! Years later I'm still thinking about how amazing their food was xoxo"}
{"input": "What center city lacks in Korean food, Eden delivers. The food is delicious, plentiful and completely homemade (the lady makes her own pickles and kimchi). My husband and I eating here, and the very kindly owner can make a wide variety of dishes, from cod stew to fried chicken, as well as the restaurants back home in Seoul. This is a family-run restaurant, where the proprietress and her husband man the kitchen and the sushi bar, and her sweet daughters wait the tables. Absolutely recommended."}
{"input": "I came here with my Peruvian girlfriend. I have been to a Peruvian restaurant in New York with her. and it was delicious. So I figured I'd give it a shot again .I ordered the half chicken cilantro meal and my sides .it was very good very tasty and a lot of food. however I felt as if I was being somehow overlooked by the wait  staff .personally. I don't know its just that when you're looking at someone in the eyes and asking them to come over and they turn around and do something else its just like they are ignoring .so I don't know maybe it's just me. but the food is excellent"}
{"input": "These are awesome. They treat me and my '12 Honda Civic well. You can't this type of service. Kind, courteous and great care. If I have any thing going on with my car I make way here."}
{"input": "I recently organized a trivia night for the nonprofit Invest STL at Urban Eats. Having a trivia night at UE was extremely easy since we had access to the staff, full kitchen and the bar. \nCaya, the co-owner was very easy to work with and she accommodated our needs and made the event run smoothly. We offered apps and a drink with our ticket price and guest were also able to order beer and food from the full menu. It worked out well because we were able to raise funds and she was able to bring in business as well. There are various spaces availabe including a loft event space upstairs for larger events. The quality of food, atmosphere and service were great. I couldn't ask for more!"}
{"input": "After the swamp tour we became sooo hungry!!! So stumbled upon The Mona Lisa lounge ....this here is customerservice at its best. This is what you call Southern hospitality! THE FOOD!!! Fresh and flavorful! If you want a salad and vegan anything...don't come here! lol This is a place where you just want to eat some comfort food and drink... away from all the craziness in the city."}
{"input": "I LOVE this place! Great service, great tequila, great atmosphere! Try the pork tacos and guacamole."}
{"input": "From the very beginning the hostess was also working as the cashier so we weren't even welcomed when we came in. We had to ask the hostess for a table and we're made to wait for no good reason. The server was pretty much non existent and was very unfriendly she didn't even introduce herself or stop by the table (let alone ask us how our food was). I order the biscuits and gravy and a side of eggs. My food was cold when it came out and wasn't even that good. And on top of it all the food is way overpriced ($30 for French toast, biscuits and gravy, and 2 sides? NO THANKS). Don't even bother wasting your time or money here. Overall terrible, definitely never coming back."}
{"input": "My husband and I ate here today.  I ordered the BLT with avocado-it was so delicious!  My husband ordered the chili cheese hamburger-the portion was huge!  The best thing about this cafe is the French fries!  These are homemade fries that are so delicious.  We didn't get a milkshake because we couldn't eat another bite.  They looked so good!  Next time we will get one meal and share a shake."}
{"input": "When this place first opened we went. We loved the Greek salad and gyros. It was very fresh tasting and the place was cute. We went back last night- the tables were all dirty, lamps full of dirt and dead bugs- so that was a turn off. We got our food and the quality has gone way down. My salad had one bite of potato salad and two items in the salad - tomato and pepper tasted off. I had to spit them out. My daughter got a fajita bowl with chicken. Her tomato was also gross and the chicken was cooked into charred rubber. We ordered baklava and it was stale. I hope they clean and go back to the quality it was when they first opened. It was yummy and clean."}
{"input": "First off, I love a good traditional Cuban sandwich, and Taste of Havana delivers.  Strong cuban, if maybe a wee bit dry.  It might be just a bit too big -- you'll be satisfied with the mini and a bag of plantain chips.  Next time, I'm going to try the chorizo.  Spanish chorizo is terrific, and the extra fat in the meat may help with the moist quotient.\n\nStill, great shop, very cool owners, and well worth the trip to Broad Ripple!"}
{"input": "I recently moved into the Bywater just a few blocks from this park. Finally got the chance to explore yesterday since the weather was so nice! I like the architecture of the park a lot, I just wish there were more shady spots and more water fountains. Walked about half a mile before I spotted any fountains but on the plus side it does claim to be filtered water! The highlight of the park for me was the off leash dog-run. I have a sweet 2 yr old Pit puppy named Jockamo who is full of so much energy and it was great to have her run around in the park for a bit! The space isn't huge but it's big enough for close to a dozen dogs I would say. It was empty on a Sat afternoon so I wonder if it is currently the Bywater's best kept secret. Bring your pups!"}
{"input": "Delicious and the waitress was awesome!  We stayed there for lunch for almost 3 hours and never felt rushed and we never felt like we were overstaying our welcome.  Great food!  Great service!!!"}
{"input": "We walked 1.5 miles (with an extra half a mile bc my fiance wouldn't use his navigation to walk there)  to eat the bananas foster french toast. He has been dreaming about this meal since he had it over a year ago. It was worth every step.\n\n I had the crab meat omelet with avocado and brie which was amazing too. The biscuit wasn't that great.\n\nService was fine, nothing special and the tables were a little sticky but dont let that deter you."}
{"input": "Meet by a great hostess at the door, Jenna. Her smile was amazing! Drinks at the bar were rather good.  They actually have a loco moco! BOOM!"}
{"input": "Delicious.  Arancini appetizer and meatballs.  Wedge salad was unique - not your typical blue cheese! Sautéed calamari was phenomenal!"}
{"input": "ommmmmmg love love love.  Pho+summer rolls with peanut sauce+pear sake=best meal ever.  Great service, casual atmosphere, the best prices.  Food was very fresh and well made, I eat on the regular! Might go eat some right now, actually.... :D Bit of advice: order a small bowl of pho...its still huge. If you have leftover pho, ask them to put the noddle in a separate container as they will get soggy before second helpings."}
{"input": "I have to write an update because I've been hearing some really nasty things about the diner part of this restaurant. I keep hearing that they've gotten super slow and that the food is gross. I I went here yesterday and it was Lightning Fast service. My salad was delicious , I got a bread basket and tons of food. Everything was out faster than I even think McDonald's could bring food out. It was not expensive. Sure I can think of plenty of better restaurants but this is a diner and I can't think of any diners in the area that are better than this"}
{"input": "Love this place for 3 reasons:\n\nDelicious food:\n-Highly recommend the beer battered green beans and the pub burger with tomato jam. They cook the burger perfectly!!\n\nDiverse drink menu:\n-Beers are always awesome, and there is enough to choose from. But I wanna talk about the Bloody Mary... ohhhhhhh... SO good!!! I live so close to this place, and I'm usually there on Sundays recovering my hangover with a TASTY bloody mary!! GET IT!\n\nThe staff:\n-One word: Hipster. But of course the cool ones. Always super friendly and assist you right away. \n\nPS. You don't even have to ask for a glass of water. They will bring it to you. classy!"}
{"input": "This unique pizza place is possibly one of my more go to places to eat with my mister. I have never been during a busy hour but I can tell you service is ALWAYS prompt and super nice staff. They have a decent beer selection and I haven't had a pizza yet that didn't satisfy my pizza craving. Perfect last minute date spot."}
{"input": "I have gone to this museum many times as a child and once as an adult. This museum is so hands on. I love how interactive it is for the kids. Since it is a children's museum the target audience is obviously more for kids than adults but it was still fun to go there as an adult. There were many neat facts I learned about while I was there. The museum is a good size with (I think) three floors. They do have elevators for those who need them. There is a parking garage across the street and the prices are fairly standard for a museum."}
{"input": "Food was good.  Waitress was attentive - probably too attentive.  She brought us the wrong check - of course, ours was higher!  Figures!  The main peeve was the opera singer - from his bad toupee to the volume, it was almost comical.  When he did \"Sweet Caroline\" in an operatic style, all we could do was laugh!"}
{"input": "Great food! We have eaten here many times and had filet, salmon, crab cakes and pasta dishes and everything is fabulous! They also have a great selection of local brewery's such as Flying Fish and Cape May brewery. We highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"input": "The courthouse was voted on TripAdvisor as the top attraction in Santa Barbara. Yes, it doesn't sound very interesting, but it's a must visit if you're in town! \n\nMake sure to make it up to the view and climb the stairs  (resist the urge to take the elevator) to watch  the clock/bell at work. The view, although not super high, is breathtaking and gives you a good look at the beauty of Santa Barbara.\n\nWe saw high schoolers doing some sort of club activity here (maybe MUN?) but that didn't stop us from enjoying the courthouse. You are free to walk he grounds--no intrusive security guards or large tour groups. It didn't feel so touristy/museum-y either which for some reason made me appreciate the experience all the more.\n\nThe best part of all--it's free! You won't need to set aside a ton of time here (maybe 30-45 min). There's ample street parking around the courthouse, at least on a weekend so get over here stat!"}
{"input": "Craving some saucy meat over rice led me to my first visit here. I browse the menu and see roasted duck on the lunch special for about 5 bucks! My wife orders that. An egg roll and choice of soup is included. The hot and sour soup was not so hot and sour, but for the price of the lunch special, it was good enough. This is probably one of the better meals I've tasted for around five dollars. Forget the foot long!\n\nI order the shrimp with scrambled eggs \"Chinese\" style. This style is  saucy as the eggs are whipped and cooked in gravy. It needed scallions and a touch of hot chili sauce. They didn't have the chili oil at the table. Maybe you have to request it. I did, however, ask for a little hot mustard on the side. Mixed with a touch of soy, I found the flavor I was looking for. The \"American\" style is fried like an omellete. \n\nWith 2 sodas, tax and tip, it was a decent roasted duck and shrimp 20 dollar meal for 2. \n\nI look forward to trying their dim sum."}
{"input": "This place is really poor on the service. I don't think they know how to handle the rush of people that come in from South St. The tables get cleaned hap-haphazardly and they don't bother wiping down the seats so when we got our spots I had to brush off a few french fries from the previous meal. 2 Stars because they apparently still know how to make a good Malt, even if it was a little expensive."}
{"input": "In Riva never disappoints. The food is delicious (mamas meat balls, polenta, duck ragu & pepperoni pizza are some of my favorites), the waitstaff is always great and the atmosphere is perfect (both indoor and outdoor).  \n\nLast night we ordered a 4 course tasting menu and it was amazing. Everything their kitchen puts out is a masterpiece!"}
{"input": "Solid option in the area. Rooms are clean and nice. Having a suite is great with kids. Bathroom setup is a bit odd inside the suite but gives a nice two sink option. They provide breakfast which I assume will be just ok but at least is free if that matters to you. The gym is pretty miserable. A depressing room with 3 elliptical machines, on bench and a few dumbbells. Pool is very unimpressive. \n\nHowever would stay again as we have kids and one room very comfortable for all."}
{"input": "I just came in for my first walk-in with Linda and got a gel manicure and pedicure. The pedicure is sub-par, she was a little TOO gentle for my liking. The gel manicure on the other hand, is fantastic...definitely the best I've ever gotten in Philly, she will be my new manicurist hands down. Staff was all very sweet and very sassy! The salon itself could use a little facelift though..."}
{"input": "Pizza was delicious had the meat eaters pizza. The pizza was perfectly proportioned and filled me up and I had to take the rest to go. I will definitely try and persuade the franchise owner to let me open my own blaze pizza in Biloxi, MS. I can imagine I would do a lot of business. God willing...."}
{"input": "Nice atmosphere.  Fresh and high quality sushi. Friendly servers. I was very pleased with my first time visit at Jasmine restaurant. \nI have noticed they have a beautiful, large round table that would probably sits about 12-15 people. It would be perfect for a large company. \nThere were many Asian families dining. I usually consider it is a good sign since they truly know how Chinese food and sushi should be.\nOverall, great experience.  I would recommend it."}
{"input": "So happy there is a family friendly place to watch football in Carp! Great atmosphere, fast service, delicious pizza."}
{"input": "Good chill spot to grab a drink and a bite after nearby restaurants have closed. Kind of a trendy dive bar if that makes sense.\n\nWe had a Cuban and a BLT, both of which were delicious late nite fare.\n\nDrinks were decent but nothing write home about. Can't get 5 stars without Luxardos if cocktails and food is your thing. That said I didn't peruse their beers on tap so maybe that's more of a focus. Guess I'll have to come back.\n\nGood friendly crowd in there on a Tuesday night."}
{"input": "This place is a gem and has been for many years. Added bonus they're open til 4am. If you're craving really good fried shrimp check this place out."}
{"input": "This place has been featured on the Food Network which for me is a red flag.  Oftentimes, these places are way over hyped and aren't really that good.  Unfortunately, this was the case for the Pancake Pantry.  I am a pancake connoisseur and I can usually tell a good pancake by  looking at it. Yes, I'm that good.  One look at these pancakes and I had their number. They were fluffy and doughy, much like the ones at McDonald's or any number of short order diners in the country.  I personally like my pancakes with a light crisp edge, which usually means they have been cooked in butter, and they should be tasty before any butter or syrup is added. Not true of the Pancake Pantry. Just ok. Milquetoast even.  Good bacon though."}
{"input": "I was sad to see Wine Thief (the previous restaurant at this location) close, but after hearing great things about Grain Exchange I took my kids and met up with another family for dinner there on a Tues night (I'd heard there can be a long wait on weekends, and they don't take reservations... yet). Such a good place--warm atmosphere, excellent seasonal food, and very friendly service. Lots of good apps, sandwiches, salads, very interesting draft beer and extensive Bourbon and Rye selection, but you have to try the fried chicken with sautéed kale and rosemary mashed potatoes--as good or better than Federal Donuts chicken. If they add reservations on Yelp/Open Table it'll be even better."}
{"input": "I'm only giving them 4 stars because I haven't tried out enough of their menu. But in regards to previous reviews saying the pizza was soggy, they must have listened! The pizza I ordered today was a personal specialty pie. Vegan general tso's pizza. It was so good! No skimping on the \"chicken\" either. The crust was crisp and fluffy, not greasy at all but still packed with flavor. The chicken had that delicious general tso's sauce coated on each piece, as well as a slight kick at the end. \n\nI will definitely be ordering from there again. When I called to see if it was possible to veganize an online order, they instructed me to simply write vegan in the comments section. And they called me back to iron out a pricing discrepancy as well! The delivery came within the time they quoted and was hot. I'd definitely recommend giving them a try. They make the seitan themselves and wow, it is good."}
{"input": "Great yoga and great workout. Only problem I think they heat the room too much they need to think about how many students there are then heat accordingly"}
{"input": "The veggies were boiled. Boiled! There was too much balsamic syrup on the not fresh fish - to mask the not fresh fish."}
{"input": "holly grove is the best. I'm consistently impressed with their selection of produce. you can basically get everything (plus more stuff they don't have at the normal grocery store) except it's all local. we are so lucky to live in a place with a year round growing season, and we should really take advantage of that! (I will get off my high horse now lol). \n\nthey also have locally raised meats, bread from local bakeries...it's just a great place to support local growers and makers. also there are always people wandering outside tending to the garden. it's a nice atmosphere. the only thing I dislike is the location - because I'm allll the way across town. that's not their fault, though."}
{"input": "Best pho in Santa Barbara County.  Staff are great.   I drive 35-40 minutes for the Pho, would drive double.   Seriously tho, no more pho withdrawals.   \n   Thanks Phamous!"}
{"input": "We had the worst experience there. 15 mintues after we order our food ahe is back to see if we want fries instead of rice cuase the rice is old....\nWhich we said no. 30 minutes later she is back with our food."}
{"input": "Cool spot. Patio vibes af.\nService was slow restaurant empty. \nBut the\nHamburger WITH the tomato jam= tits. \nDo it."}
{"input": "Beer service was lackluster. The first beer I ordered had an off flavor (sour). I ordered a taste of another similar dark beer to see if the problem was endemic but it wasn't. I would have appreciated it more if the bar tender looked into the off flavor when I sent my beer back. This tells me the bar tender doesn't know beer. I assume that particular draft line needs to be cleaned but maybe the problem was with the keg. \n\nAnother thing that killed me was their use of glassware. They serve beers in the classic American \"Shaker\" pint glass and serve water in the far superior English Nonic Pint glass. I also saw the bar tender pour a white ale with normal ABV in a stemmed tulip glass.\n\nThe shaker pint glasses are kept refrigerated and are too cold in my opinion. I would much rather see them kept at room temp and rinsed in cold water (which they do here). \n\nAll in all, the beer knowledge is not up to par for a place that advertises as a burger joint with a large craft beer selection (30 taps)."}
{"input": "This is my favorite steakhouse in Sparks/Reno area.  A great hidden treasure.  Full of suprise and what a great dining experience.  So far a cut Above the rest of the areas steakhouses."}
{"input": "Still my favorite Roast Beef Poor Boy in the city! Bring your wet-naps, you're going to need them! Hot Roast Beef and an ice cold Dixie, Ahhhh, that's living."}
{"input": "Okay I was skeptical of the wings based on the previous reviews but it was everything we were expecting and then some.  The bartender is super friendly and extremely helpful.  The wings are the best in town and there is no debating it.  Great happy hour specials for domestic drafts that end at 8:00 pm.  We will be back very soon!"}
{"input": "What could be better than sitting outside with wine and cheese, listening to music? Get there early to get a seat...this place is slammed by 5! Great cheese and wine section. Hidden jem for the locals in the Bywater. Casual and relaxed."}
{"input": "The people at the store amazing! We came in to exchange a shirt from a few days before they had had some damage, and the managers were so helpful with our situation. Tonya is the best. Without hesitation she is going to help us out."}
{"input": "Bread tasted old and was dry. Beef had no flavor and there was hardly any provolone. This is a big disappointment and will definitely hurt the brand name over this airport excuse."}
{"input": "Absolutely delicious foods!! Hard to find a vegan restaurant in the area and this was definitely an amazing find. People who worked there were so friendly and knew what they were talking about when it came to answering questions relating to the foods offered. \n\nThe presentations of the food too were beautiful and a good Sized portion as well. We went for brunch, am looking forward to going back sometime for lunch/dinner!"}
{"input": "You know the place must have good food when the average BMI of their patrons is 42. \n\nSouth Jersey has diners galore... which one to choose? WHICH ONE TO CHOOOOOSE?!?! Oh the options! Picked Meadow's Diner based on the reviews and was not disappointed. \n\nCame in at 10:30ish on a Saturday morning and while busy, I was still seated promptly and with a smile. Service was slightly lacking for refills on water but heeeeeey! It's JERSEY. I had the French Toast w/ Italian Sausage (which was homemade and very authentic [not to mention spicy]). The French Toast was fluffy but a bit cold. Boyfriend had some sort of artery clogging omelet which was very tasty but I'm sure it was about 5,000 calories (heeeeeeey! it's JERSEY!). \n\nOverall I good place to eat really fattening foods to give you the serious ITIS for about 12 hours. $50 for 5 people"}
{"input": "My favorite Reno lunch spot and has been for years.  Love their sandwiches and salads.  Deserts amazing too.  Nice ambiance.  Owner a doll.  The ONLY thing I dislike, and don't understand, is how bad the service is!  Waitresses are always SO slow!  I typically have to go track one down to take order...annoying.  (Albeit they are  friendly)"}
{"input": "Best Nail Salon in Tampa! \nIt were pretty busy to be a Wednesday, which means they're good! I didn't feel like she was rushing, she took her time with me they give wonderful massages I got a Deluxe Pedi and it's amazing! I love the fact that the person who did my pedi also did my shellac mani! I felt pampered!"}
{"input": "My family ate here last night and thought the food and service were excellent."}
{"input": "Love that they have military discount - thank you.\n\nVariety of burgers. \nShake was good.\nLove they have coke products.\nHouse ketchup was great.\nYou can have a lettuce wrapped sandwich.\n\n\nIssues:\nSweet potato Fries not cooked well enough \nTruffle fries okay \nBurger under cooked and asked for well done.\nOn the expensive side for what you get.\n\nIt will be a one time visits"}
{"input": "Amazing food and fantastic service. Get hungry, order, and repeat! Highly recommend this place if you need a Chinese fix!"}
{"input": "The man who worked on me did a wonderful job. I loved the flower the lady painted on my big toe. For those reasons I will be back."}
{"input": "The food was amazing but i never got everything in my order. I ordered the cheesesteak lunch special and it was suppose to come with a drink but i never received it. Cheesesteak was amazing and was cooked to perfection. The meatball parm is to die for. No other comments on the meatballs. The milkshakes i ordered they only brought me one when i ordered two but i still never got the other one. I would order from here again but afraid of not getting everything i paid for."}
{"input": "I loved it! Sushi rolls were amazing! Cute place. I will definetly be back to try more! So happy to have found this place! YaY!!"}
{"input": "Only have had drinks there as the menu looks like nothing special. \n\nBut The atmosphere is really cool to have a drink in. \n\nIt has a nice breeze and you can see the gulf from inside the bar."}
{"input": "I stayed here with my sister in law for her 21st birthday. The complimentary breakfast was much better than most hotels I have stayed at. The hotel was very nice and clean. We booked a room with 2 queen beds but received a room with one queen bed and a pull out couch. We made it work but my back really would've been better off on an actual bed versus a springy outdated couch. Besides the sleeping situation we really enjoyed our stay. The Mall is right next door so we took advantage of the beautiful weather and walked over. There are a ton of great restaurants right near the hotel as well as the IMAX movie theater. If your dining in the hotels restaurant I highly recommend the guacamole bacon cheddar grilled cheese. It was hands down the best grilled cheese I've ever had."}
{"input": "Had brunch on a Saturday. Food was delicious! Service was great! Great atmosphere! Will definitely put this place in my rotation of favorite spots!"}
{"input": "The food was good but I'm giving this one less star because if you're not into breakfast there really aren't a lot of interesting lunch items and after waiting a good thirty plus minutes for a table and nearing 1 pm, the \"lunch\" type item you wanted may be gone. So if you're not really in the mood for pancakes or eggs, this may not be the place for you. That being said if you're into breakfast, the pancakes are creatively good. I had the pecan pancakes which were delightfully flavorful."}
{"input": "Skip the fancy desert after dinner to go here, it's an excuse to walk around Broadway.  The homemade ice cream is really good.  Cake Mix is my favorite.   Great place to top off a date."}
{"input": "So disappointed with this place. Read great reviews and had high hopes. We ordered Singapore noodles, honey garlic chicken, chicken balls & Chicken fried rice. Very bland taste, most of it went to the bin. For all you Irish people that are expecting it to be as good as home, it most certainly is nothing like it."}
{"input": "I love the fries (wow, I'm still thinking about them because they're that good!) but I was not impressed by the beef kebob sandwich.  The sandwich was heavy on the onions and light on the meat, so it could have been better.  I do think that may have been an off sandwich, so I'm thinking of going back to give it a second chance (and to have another helping of fries!).  Smoothies also tasted like syrup and ice.  Prices are fair and service is great.  I love the mom and pop feel of the restaurant :)."}
{"input": "Stopped for sushi on our way to LA. A little hesitant since I read Yelp reviews.  Surprisingly solid good sushi. Fresh and very reasonably priced. Good service even with resturaunt busy. Would go again."}
{"input": "I never knew about this store till my     sister-n-law got me a vase from this store.\nMy husband and I had to return it due to not going with our decor.\nWe fell in love with the store so we decided to have a decorator come to our home for free. Bailey came to our house And help us figure out how to decorate our new home. \nWe ended up buying a new couch a rug a lamp and an ottoman. We love every thing and she went above and beyond to help us and we are going to keep using her till our home is finished."}
{"input": "Plume is a nice little homey salone decorated in a hip shabby-chic flea market type style.  They always offer a drink in their waiting area (i usually go for one of the teas) and they have an assortment of books to browse while you wait.  I've gotten my hair cut here several times and have had both Bridget and Tina (might be a different T name..Tracy?) perform the services.  I have long hair with layers and had been trying for a while to incorporate some of my heavy kid-bangs back into my hair.  I brought in pictures of Bridget Bardot with a hairstyle I liked.  Bridget (the stylist) spent a lot of time on the cut making sure it was even and blended. Tina or Tracy (sorry!) spent a little less time, but still delivered a cut comparable to cuts I've gotten from salons thath charge 60$ or more.  Plume's prices are affordable (40$ last time i went) but it's cash only, so be prepared!  There is only street parking, but it's usually not too difficult to find a spot within 1.5 blocks."}
{"input": "5 stars, as far as sports bars go. Awesome atmosphere with tons of TVs, high ceilings which allows for huge projectors to show games, great service, prices and food. For my gluten free eaters, the tortilla chips and fries are both gluten free. They also use a separate fryer from their breaded goods, so no cross contamination! Try the Buffalo Chicken nachos... the chicken is grilled, so no worries there. It is covered in cheese sauce and bleu cheese, too. I opted for extra buffalo sauce for more balance between hot and cheesy. I got the bacon cheeseburger with no bun, which was made from high quality sirloin. It was incredibly good! Their mixed drinks didn't skimp on the alcohol either. High recommended. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"input": "Girlfriend (cpa) got their \"cpa\" and liked it. Me bring a huge GOT fan got the \"white walker\" both were good as were the pizzas!"}
{"input": "Yum! Thank you, Anthony, for the great lasagna and the best carrot cake ever! Kudos also for the delicious homemade lentil soup... I should have taken an extra one of those to go. Reservations To Go is the answer for good food and great service."}
{"input": "I loooooooooooove this place the food the service the atmosphere everything is just EXCEPTIONALLLLL Mofongo to die for and the house Sangria!!!! If you are looking for a good place with some authentic Puerto Rican dishes this is the place YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT."}
{"input": "I thought it was so cool having these guys represent me. They are on tv and that how I found them. They do very well on DUI. I called they were very nice and had a very professional team. Its a big law firm but they assign certain people, so they get to know you. Questions, concerns, anything, they would answer promptly and in great detail! I would call really late at night and they would still answer. I am writing this review because I got off the hook. I learned a great lesson. But this place is amazing."}
{"input": "Great food and service. However, I recently found out that the tips do not go to the waiters.... Which should say on the menus."}
{"input": "Started with a few drinks. Nice custom cocktail selection. Waitress was real nice and went through the menu with us. It's almost all shared plates. Very trendy, cool concept rarely pulled off well. Started with buffalo pork belly and meatballs. Pork belly was really good. Good, spicy and fatty ( you have to be into that thing). Meatballs were excellent. The only thing I would have wanted were toast points or crustinis to dip in the left over sauce. The margarita pizza was awesome wood fired, thin sauce (which I believe belongs on a pizza) and a doughy thin crust. Finished up with some vanilla and Nutella gelato. Great meal! We'll be back!"}
{"input": "Came here once with friends and enjoyed the coconut margarita, the creamiest tableside  guacamole made to my liking served with yummy fresh and warm thin tortilla chips and free churros!! I ordered a salad but the chicken was dry and the dressing (requested on the side) didn't please me. I even asked for another dressing but still didn't quite hit the spot. I'd definitely come back for the margaritas, guac/chips and churros though!"}
{"input": "So far it's been great. I have eaten here for dinner 4 or 5 times and a few times for lunch. Great option for a healthier meal and decent pricing. Glad to see they have the new location which is located near my office and home. Service has been great and the staff as been very friendly. I really like the kids meal options because it's great to find something other than chicken tenders or mack and cheese for my daughter. They really understand what a child should eat."}
{"input": "Maybe I just tried this place when they were having a bad day or perhaps I ordered the one bad menu choice. Whichever was true, I was completely disappointed in the food. The green corn tamale was solid masa, no cheese or corn in sight. The beef taco was flavorless and the taco shell was soggy and fell apart with the first bite. With an order of average guacamole and chips, my bill was over ten dollars and I had to pick up at the counter and eat out of a styrofoam carry out box. Even their famous tortilla was uninspiring, served in a plastic bag, wrapped around a plastic fork. There are many other places in Tucson for good Mexican food. Sorry that I can't say this is one of them."}
{"input": "This place was terrible.  We had a muffin out of the case that you could have used to play hockey with.  I had the breakfast nachos and they used a microwave to cook a fake egg. How hard is it to cook a real egg?  Do not waste your money.  I have had better food on a flight in China.  Coffee and smoothly were adequate."}
{"input": "I went to Desire Oyster Bar back in 2/2009 and really liked it.\n\nI had three types of oysters here (BBQ, charbroiled with cheese, and raw).  The BBQ was good (fried with BBQ sauce and blue cheese)."}
{"input": "I love raw oysters and the Happy Hour oysters are a great deal at 50 cents each.  We were seated in the back room which was nice and had the best server.  The back room is much quieter and made for a great place to enjoy our food and chat with our friends.  Our table ordered 48 oysters to start and the order came out in decent time.  I really enjoyed the oyster feast."}
{"input": "We ate in. Awful pizza.\n\nShared the Philly steak pizza with bacon on the side.\n\nPizza was oily and soggy with little sauce and no flavor. Got sauce on the side and it was so watery as to be a liability.\n\nBacon was just heated bacon bits (worst I ever had) with no taste but lots more grease.\n\nWe were the ONLY customers eating in the entire time. Only sound was the overloud music.\n\nWaiter was just one of the kitchen workers who was, however, very accommodating when he was available.\n\nIf you decide to go, I wish you much better luck.\n\nRating on pizza = minus 2.5"}
{"input": "Great little local diner. Food was all very fresh and well prepared and if the Hollandaise was from a packet it fooled me! Much better then the mediocre joint just down the street with the prime location."}
{"input": "Recently took my family over to Shephards for a Birthday celebration.  They were extremely accommodating considering the variety of our group.  Great atmosphere, music and one of the largest buffets I have ever seen.  SImply Gorgeous!"}
{"input": "I loved this place. These tacos were delicious and the salsa options were fantastic. \n\nThere isn't much to say. You walk to the counter, order the food, get your salsa from the salsa bar, and chow down. \n\nIf you want street tacos, look no further. You've reached the spot."}
{"input": "So I no longer go here which is a shame because The eyebrow waxing here is fantastic. I am giving this 2 stars because when I have contacted for an appointment via the phone, it usually has taken days for me to get a response. The online booking is useless because I rarely have found appointments within 2 weeks of when I need it (and I'm very flexible with time of day). \n\nI give up on this place. Unless you book out weeks in advance, you will not get an appointment. I'm now paying $10 more elsewhere which sucks but I'm able to get seen when I need to be seen."}
{"input": "Friday night was date night for Mr. And I. I had 3 olive martini's and spaghettini with plum tomatoes. Big city martini and osso bucco for Mr. Our awesome waiter was Joe and the live music was awesome!"}
{"input": "Great experience here! People were very friendly, rooms were clean and I loved the smell inside the hotel. \n\nOn our last day here, someone came by our room to tell us that checkout was at 11 and we needed to leave, (it was slightly after 10:40) and I found that very strange because we were still out of the room before 11 regardless. Overall it was a good experience!"}
{"input": "The food was yummilicious!   The fries could have had alittle more shredded duck,  but the overall flavor was spot on.  Duck Fat! \nThe Tso  wings writer the wasabi blue cheese dipping sauce was wonderful... not too spicy which was  perfect for me. \nOne complaint... . our waiter was packing our food and instead of using a utensil he used his fingers.... I was not happy about this... and will pack my own food moving forward. \nSo that means I'm going back!"}
{"input": "I am a groupie. He is amazing. I am sad that I got to have his dish only once. Now all construction on market I can't find him!!\n\nHis chicken is the most tender and smoky I've ever had. Side dishes are creative and awesome too. \nI hope he is back soon."}
{"input": "We were heading out for brunch in the Garden District and literally made the cabby pull over as soon as we saw this place.  Hey - sounds like a bunch of good things rolled into one.  It was early, so we didn't have the sliders, but the donuts and coffee were exceptional.  The donuts looked overdone and loaded up with unnecessary ingredients at first, but I was wrong.  They were actually well balanced with good flavors.  They take coffee seriously too.  I tried their \"Cold Nitro Brew\" which seemed more like a Guinness than an iced coffee.  It wasn't exactly my style (so switched it for a latte instead) but I applaud them for trying to innovate."}
{"input": "Wonderful!!!!!!    Best place I have ever been!!  Dr. Lore is amazing!"}
{"input": "The best Indian food that I've had. The service is usually okay and sometimes great. The naan is perfect. The Dum Aloo is to die for! I've had many of the vegetarian options here and all of them have been good. My friend loves the lamb vindaloo and chicken tikki masala here. They do a good job getting the amount of spice right."}
{"input": "I was surprised at every turn. From drinks (amazing martinis) to apps to entrees to desserts, this was the best meal I've had in a long time. And the service was outstanding. You can't go wrong with the Red Pony BLT (that \"L\" is for lobster, people, served over potato ravioli and truffle corn cream) or the braised rabbit (over farro and andouille, with a tobasco hollandaise).  Just work your way through the menu. I'll be back. Probably next week. And the week after."}
{"input": "SO GOOD! Everything home made, everything I've tried is delicious and really good drinks and pastries... HIGHLY recommend :)"}
{"input": "The lunch special Brisket sandwich with 2 sides for $10 was amazing. The brioche bun was soft and buttery, the meat flavorful and tender, the sauce lick your fingers good! I had the Mac & Cheese (made with gouda) and Black Eyed Peas as my sides with an extra of banana pudding. Everything was so delicious! The girl at the order counter was really nice and helpful, giving me tastes when I couldn't decide on a side. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"input": "Incredible wine and booze selections. Clean and organized. Sadly the produce was terrible. Bad oranges and peaches in Florida??? That was disappointing."}
{"input": "Stopped by for cheesecake with no one in line, and was ignored by three people before one of them finally acknowledged me. Got the turtle cheesecake. The cheesecake itself was okay. The toppings along with it made it better. These are really like cheesecake sundaes. I should've gotten a regular size. The large was two servings worth."}
{"input": "We stayed at the Avalon for 2 days after a cruise. Everyone and everything was wonderful. We had sandwich s day one with the happy hour Daquri! Delicious...... Dessert was awesome. Great service. Next day breakfast pulled out all the stops. Later poolside with $3.00 craft beer. The pool and surrounding area are beautiful well appointed. Each and every staff member was friendly out going, suggestions on area museums and attractions. We will be back! Avalon and Hollander better than our Cruise!"}
{"input": "I was thrilled when my favorite eyebrow threading place opened this location in Wesley Chapel. I see Ina every 2 or 3 weeks, and I am very pleased with her work. She is not as speedy as some of the others, but that is because she takes time to make sure she has done a thorough job."}
{"input": "So good! Been ordering here for a couple months now. Always fresh, hot, and consistent. Very clean location with friendly staff."}
{"input": "Here on Saturday morning. It was packed but we waited a total of 15 minutes from start to finish. The donuts themselves are excellent alone. We got Half a dozen, one maple glazed bacon, one peanut butter chocolate drizzle, one blueberry powder, one lemon coconut, one blueberry coconut, and one glazed chocolate. And we both shared a bite out of each. No complaints. Order by preference. I mean what can you say about them...They're donuts.  They're slightly crispy, fresh, hot and yummy."}
{"input": "Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday around 1:30 . We had a large party of 10.\nI did not call ahead but lucky us, they were clearing a Large long table booth that sat us all, no wait. Its a bit loud, even mid afternoon, so expect to talk with the other end folks.\n\nService was good, laid back and friendly.\n\nWe started off with the Tatar tot fondue, a variety of Burger's and Shake's.\n\nI had the Fenway, that has sausage and pepper's. Also had the sweet potato tots, a local beer on tap  and the Kentucky Thunder shake. All was awesome in taste and flavor. Also no complaints from the other 9 in the group. Definitely would go back."}
{"input": "Holy Moly!   Huge amount of food.  I ordered the Cuban special with fries 6$  definitely worth every dime.  I was staving and this was a great little whole in the wall.  Décor was a little outdated.  The waitress was so pleasant and friendly we chatted the whole time I was waiting for my order - I must say it was fast ... a definite stop over place that I will go to again."}
{"input": "John Besh. Brunch. You'd think you'd be in Creole heaven, but the experience was a bit dissatisfying. \n\nI ordered the Friday express, which included a soup or salad and an entree. I forget what it's called but it contained shrimp, oyster and a tiny crab claw. It was okay. Nothing stood out. \n\nAfter eating the Shrimp and Grits at Cafe Amelia, we were excited to see how others compared. At Luke, you get a sizable portion and it's good but not great. \n\nOverall, there were better samplings of brunch and creole food elsewhere."}
{"input": "This place is so great. I love the laid back atmosphere. Walked right in with our dog and were seating on the cozy wrap around porch outside. We ate here the last morning of our trip and it was the perfect ending. I stayed full long enough to get me through and 8 hour car ride home! I had the bananas foster French toast which was amazing but super rich. I couldn't eat it all because of the portion size and richness. My fiancé opted for the healthier choice of a vegetable omelet which was delicious as well. I can't wait to come back here and try something else on the menu. I will definitely try one of their famous juices next time."}
{"input": "My review is simple: the BEST cake I've ever had, hands down. There isn't even a close second. They did my wedding cake and other desserts. FABULOUS! Have you ever seen an ENTIRE wedding cake be devoured in about 30 minutes???? People couldn't get enough. And it was BEAUTIFUL!!!! Highly recommend! Even if you don't need a large order, just go get a cupcake. You will dream about it for months, wanting more."}
{"input": "Excellent service! Great diner food and breakfast is served all day. Came here for lunch- they were busy but very friendly and hospitable. Easy to get to off the 295."}
{"input": "I like everything. I love the ramen noodles here. They are pretty good but i don't see much people come there. Prob they need to advertise more or do something to make more people come to eat."}
{"input": "This is a local treasure, we have lived in the area now for 20 years and every time the heat is on , this is the place to stop to cool down. They serve a wide range of food and cooling treats that many flock to especially during the summer, we go on a regular basis and will continue to as long as they are open !"}
{"input": "Good beer selection. Not the best. Chill atmosphere, partially owned by the cast of it's always sunny."}
{"input": "I love it when a plan comes together! A few days before I tried PJ Subs my brother and I were talking about where to get a great sub in town. We had given up on finding a good place. The next day, in a friends car, I saw the sign I must have flown past many times. But since I had Subs on the brain it stuck this time. I had to make a note to myself because I don't hangout at the corner of 6th & Tucson as much as I use to back in the day. Not sure why, it's a perfectly good corner.\n\nI wasn't sure what door to enter, didn't want to interrupt a mechanic in the middle of an Auto-pay. Turns out no cars or car fumes just good-friendly service & good food. I had the roast beef on rye with a beer can't remember the name of cause this was a while ago. \n\nAfter some planning & rescheduling, I was able to introduce my brother to PJ's he liked it too. As the little sister it's nice to show my big brother a SUB or 2."}
{"input": "Surprised this place is rated so high. I love sushi. With a name like crazy sushi I was really hesitant. It's kinda like any place who has a weird name like that is a red flag but the reviews were so good I figured what the heck. The sashimi I had was a large portion, but the tuna was clearly dyed as it was so red it was nearly purple. I didn't touch the salmon. The bonsai tree roll that is wrapped in cucumber was soggy. The spicy tuna roll was stuffed with filling hardly any rice. The yellowtail roll was pure flakes and no fish. The miso was good though. Fresh and a good amount of miso. I asked for extra ginger, was on the receipt, and received none. So if you want miso check out if you know anything about sushi pass. Delivery was an hour, I was told 20 minutes. The guy on phone had me screaming my order it seemed really busy and he was super rushed. Pass on them."}
{"input": "The staf was very accomodating and very friendly. I was very impressed with the whole deal. We pretty much got to order anything from the menu. Could have served a little larger portions and took a little lon to get the food but it was good."}
{"input": "Always a great experience when I stop in. The darkness croissant and the morning bun are my favorites, but I always love trying something new each visit."}
{"input": "A taste of Italy. The Gelato which I got (limone) and pizza(prosciutto di Parma) was authentic will surely  be back everything reminded me of Italia. Love it."}
{"input": "Dorignac's is a great local grocery store.  They have tons of local products, as well as national brands.  The quality is pretty good.  The employees are friendly and helpful.  I only wish they had a couple more locations.  I only go here when I'm in the area, and that's not very often."}
{"input": "Walking in, it took a bit to be greeted and seated....and the restaurant had only about 10 people sitting. \n\nHowever, once we sat down, and handed menu's, I knew this was gonna be good. \n\nJanie had the Lasagna, which had spinach inside.....very good!  I had ravioli with a mushroom sauce and ravioli with veal an maranaria sauce....really good!! Thought I was back in Italy!! Definitely an authentic experience."}
{"input": "I totally agree with Heather M.  \n\nIt's a very nice setup to watch sports or hangout.  On Sunday's it shows the Cleveland Browns games (the other games are on/no sound), but they're a pretty entertaining crowd :) $2 Yuengling lagers and $5 secret nachos round it out awesomely I think."}
{"input": "Odd location but unique find. It's simple but well done. If I wasn't on a carbless diet, I'd be here more often. Although I enjoy the bibimbaps. My favorite here is the Chap Jae noodles. My daughter and I can't get enough of them. Service is also friendly and awesome. Great spot for the college kids nearby. A little bit of an inconvenience for me(south reno)."}
{"input": "Great pizza and wings. Service is always quick and friendly with fresh beer on tap. Plenty of tvs and arcade games to choose from. Yay peggs!"}

{"input": "I went to the drive thru hopefully I can get served so was at the speaker for half hour and lady had a attitude cause we asked if we could get service to say they had to change till and several cars left in the process I had to go home hungry that was totally sad luckily I not a diabetic"}
{"input": "OK.. I want to make it clear I am only talking about this Moxie's location.. We eat at the other two, and they are awesome. We did decide to try this one. We walked into the tiny restaurant portion, and it wreaked of cigarette smoke. We looked over to the right and noticed a glass door that opened into a bar where people were obviously smoking. We turned around a walked out. If the owners of Moxie's are reading this, if you are going to have a smokey bar, please make sure that there is no way the smoke can get into the restaurant."}
{"input": "Leslie is outstanding. A colleague recommended her to me over a year ago and we've never looked back. We'd tried a couple other services in the past, but never quite found the right fit. Brooms N Buckets is professional, thorough, wonderfully friendly and everything I'd been looking for."}
{"input": "I usually steer clear of the chain restaurants (since there are so many other good restaurants here in STL), but eating at Brio was a good choice.  I've had brunch, lunch, and dinner here and all were fantastic.  It was also pretty easy to get last minute reservations.  The mushroom ravioli was delicious...I'd definitely get it again!"}
{"input": "Very disappointed.... food was only ok.... waitress was not to be found.\nThere's way too many other great restaurants in New Orleans to settle for a place like this."}
{"input": "The Tasty Cupcake & Wine tour was the best! Their customer service was great, wine was great & so were the cupcakes. We even got to take cupcakes home as a part of the package!!"}
{"input": "I can't say enough about the excellent service I received at this establishment. I worked with Desmond and he made the entire experience painless (I mean - who likes shopping for a mattress?). From narrowing down which mattress was best for me to working with my crazy schedule on the delivery - he made it all work. The purchase price was reasonable and the mattress is very comfy. I highly recommend this business."}
{"input": "Went there to see the Nashville Yacht Club Band with some friends, had a great time. The atmosphere was perfect, I love the open bar and pool area connected. The bartenders name was Eckhard and he really made the experience worthwhile. I could tell they were understaffed and no one payed me any attention for at least 5 minutes. Then, he not only completes my order but creates a perfect cocktail just for me. That's what I expect in a hotel atmosphere. Will return again only to have Eckhard make me some hangin drinks!!"}
{"input": "The Churros are mouth watering Delisious service was amazing there tacos are fabulous overall they are amazing"}
{"input": "Classic Mexican place. Meat was good and guacamole did not cost extra. Comparable to Chipotle but I think it was a little better. The music was too loud when I was there but that is my only complaint"}
{"input": "This is a small coffe place own by Karyn, a blond sweet lady with a big smile! Great coffee and they have drive through"}
{"input": "I wish I'd checked into this place to prove my attendance, but I submitted a picture of the ribs because they were THE bomb.\n\nI'm from Texas. And I know ribs, even the pork variety we aren't known for. I've judged competitive BBQ. I know my ribs. These are the best dang ribs I've EVER eaten. Dry rub, oak-smoked, with a raspberry/jalapeño glaze, tender, meaty. I would travel again, just to eat them again. (Very good grilled oysters, too.) Not a bad plate in the house, I suspect."}
{"input": "At first I didn't think I would like this place. They seemed too hipster for me and no cider.\nBut......\nGreat friendly staff. Awesome snacks.\nChanging selection of local beers on tap.\nI know this doesn't seem like a good selling point, but they have clean bathrooms and the place is kept clean. Not very common in the Downtown area.\n\nTry one of the neat beer cocktails and fried pickles."}
{"input": "Restaurant is very clean who was delicious have steak and veggies with sweet tea very fast and friendly service"}
{"input": "Inattentive and confused waiters could have been either inexperienced or under staffed. Bring SPF 45 sunblock in case you seated near the neon sign. Food was par. Bring crayons, tables are covered in paper. Bottom line: tonight was my first and last experience at st. Tropez."}
{"input": "Excellent food that is reasonably priced.  The staff is nice and the manager really cares about your experience.  You'll also find some of the best pizzas in the area here -- has a similar taste to Vito's Pizza just down the road.  Love their bread basket which has pizza sticks that are phenomenal.  Plus it's kid friendly.  Try the eggplant parm.  Then end the evening with a cannoli."}
{"input": "Needed to have a section of my carpet repaired in my bedroom. The Team and R&N was prompt and very focused on making the room look like new. They did just that. Great value, I would definitely give them a shot."}
{"input": "Perfect little place to stop in for good food and drinks for an even better price - something you don't find everywhere!  The fish tacos were good, not the best, but for the price and how quickly they were prepared, I was very happy.  My friends raved about their Korean BBQ tacos, so if that's your type, give 'em a try because you can at least know your wallet won't regret it!  The bar and inside area fills up quickly with a crowd, but outside is where it's at anyway.  They have it all set up without too much \"atmosphere,\" so you and your friends can spread out."}
{"input": "The gentleman in the truck was very nice so he accepted making a fish quesadilla for me although it's not on the menu. It was the best quesadilla I had till this moment to be honest"}
{"input": "New York in Indianapolis. Beautiful room with the nicest of linens, soft towels, high quality soaps and exceptional service. Walking distance to Lucas Oil Stadium and downtown if you like a short hike. Parking cost was also New York caliber. \n\nWe grabbed a quick bite in the bar/restaurant. Was not impressed. I'm usually not a fussy eater but the bun was like cardboard and inedible. Meat was dry. I expected so much more for what it cost. Left without eating half of it. Recommend finding another place to catch a bite."}
{"input": "Great Greek food with friendly service from Alan.  I had a lamb gyro from a place down south this week that confirmed that Santorini offers the best gyro around and definitely my favorite."}
{"input": "Great atmosphere and decor. Super friendly staff seat you right away. I stopped once for lunch and one time for dinner. They have some lunch specials one of which was Pad Thai. I order with chicken as the protein but they have the typical options for this .  The portion was good for lunch and had good flavor.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the chicken satay to start and the Panang Curry with chicken for main course. I was very disappointed in the satay being that you only get two small skewers. The flavor and peanut dipping sauce were very good but they give a few more skewers.  The Panang was good and you get a good size portion of rice.\n\nOn a side note, I was disappointed they do not have Pad See Ew. Still some other options on the menu I will return to try.\n\nThe staff and manager really know customer service.  Look forward to returning soon!"}
{"input": "When I decided that St. Joseph's wasn't the university for me and I was going to leave the area, I knew really the only thing I would miss were the friends that I made (obviously) and cheesesteaks from Larry's.  Being that it was just across the street from campus, it was the easiest dinner one could find if they missed dinner in the dining hall.\n\nI think I gained much of the beginning of my \"freshman 15\" because of Larry's!  Popular among many SJU students, you will find a younger crowd usually occupying the tables chowing down or waiting for their order to be done.  The cheesesteaks are big for the price that they charge and they are always stuffed!\n\nYou can't find cheesesteaks like that anywhere but Philly!"}
{"input": "If I could give this place 6 stars I would. Don't let the looks deceive you, great diner food. Biscuits and gravy were incredible. Portions were more than I could eat."}
{"input": "Quick weekend get away. Friendly staff and very quick check in. The parking lot is tight but not impossible.\nOur room was super cute and perfect for my beach side stabbin cabin. Bow chic a wow wow.\nThe courtyard area echos a little bit so it can get a little noisy. Small continental breakfast available  with really good coffee, not kidding.\nWe enjoyed our quick stay here...... ;)"}
{"input": "Amazing place! Great for kids and there is a sandbox they can play at. People were nice the nachos w chili were good . Mostly the atmosphere fire pit and seats by the ocean were our favorite"}
{"input": "\"Feather free\" in my profile.  \"Feather free\" in my reservation.  \"Feather free\" by special request when I called four hours before arrival.  \"Feather free\" confirmed upon check in.  In the room?  Feathers.  Will Hyatt ever understand how important this is?  Will it take another trip to the emergency room?   And $29/night to park also absurd for St. Louis.  \"Sorry about that sir\" gets old."}
{"input": "Great rolls and sake. We sat in the bamboo room, which definitely added to the experience, if you are able and agile."}
{"input": "What a happy mistake it was to randomly run into this place while exploring the Garden District in New Orleans. The donuts were out of this world (I can't believe they have new ones everyday)! I was with a group and we split a few, so we could try a selection. Would DEFINITELY recommend stopping by!"}
{"input": "Holy bat crap, this place is amazing. Go to place in St. Pete, anything on the menu was good. Food coma!"}
{"input": "Every time we go to this place, we go because of the enticing beer selections, but time after time we leave disappointed by a complacent bar staff that makes you feel like an inconvenience. It's such a shame. The beer selection is second to none, but this time we had one drink and decided to spend our money elsewhere for dinner. This place has been consistent for sure, every time we go, we get a miserable bartender who seems like they'd rather be working on a slow night when they don't have to talk to people. All of the enticing beer in the world won't bring us back. \n\nThe owners brother has a great place a few miles away, Brickside Grill, we went there instead...good beer, excellent food and the staff is consistently friendly and engaging!"}
{"input": "I cannot say enough good things about this shop. It all starts with Jamie and Stacey who are absolute superstars and fantastic artists. They will take the time to work with you on your design, making sure they give you what you want, they are technically sound and very talented artists and their prices are great. The shop is immaculately clean and has a very comfortable ambiance. It has been a pleasure to get tattooed here. I will continue coming here for all my tattoo needs."}
{"input": "We came on a hot sorcerer of a day to avoid the heat. There were a total of 5 people in the bar, including the bartender and musician. But I like it that. Our bartender made true craft cocktails. It was awesome watching her work. Didn't try the food but it smelled amazing when it came out."}
{"input": "Love this place chill atmosphere, very informative staff and friendly!   Vast beer selection! Wish I had a place like this in California! Will miss it"}
{"input": "Visited at breakfast time and liked having the coffee pot at the table.  Have eaten at the Plano, Tx location also.  LePeep is consistently fresh and offers a broad range of menu options.   Will definitely be back again."}
{"input": "My favorite Starbucks! The employees are excellent and learn the regulars. However the parking kind of stinks but that's not their fault."}
{"input": "So we ordered a New York Strip to share, medium rare.  The waiter, who by the way was outstanding, brings the steak,  it is cut in half length wise making it the thinnest steak I have ever seen in an Outback.  We send it back, out it comes again and delivered by the manager, cut properly but still the thinnest stake we have ever been served at an Outback.  I make this observation to the manager, he ignores what is said and moves on.  The rest of the meal is good.  We decide on splitting a slice of carrot cake, because the portions are always generous, and ask for it to go.,  It was the thinnest slice of cake I think I have ever seen, certainly not worth $5.00.  Compared to other Outbacks, I would guess this one is VERY profitable, as it appears they are controlling costs by thinning portions."}
{"input": "This was the only BBQ I had while in Tennessee and it was great!\n\nI had the beef brisket, with a side of potato salad and Mac & cheese. The BBQ sauce was sweet and exactly what I enjoy. I wasn't extremely impressed with the sides, I thought the mac could have been better!\n\nI was bummed that the fried okra wasn't in season, but will return on my next visit to Nashville to try it out!\n\nThis was my first bushwhacker experience and I loved it! It's this crazy boozy frozen drink- think boozy chocolate milkshake but better."}
{"input": "We love the rolled ice cream here! The choice of toppings is also a big hit with the kids. A nice change from those other ice cream shops."}
{"input": "Place is very nice,cozy,cute. Staff is friendly. Cupcakes are so delicious. Everything looks beautiful and tasty. No long lines and variety. Street parking."}
{"input": "first time getting my brows done, i think it was maria? She did a good job and made me feel comfy"}
{"input": "Popped in on a humbug with one of my besties. Never heard of the place, but had a sweet tooth. I had a smoothie (tropical something) and was quite happy. It was pretty tasty. The manager was really friendly and accommodating and talking my friend into trying the icecream. She picked the butter pecan and that ended up in an eye roll towards heaven. Needless to say she was sold on getting something as well. Got some strawberry cheesecake to go and I'm super happy. Definitely will we going back."}
{"input": "This is what I would consider a fast-paced Goodwill. If you don't move quickly, you likely won't find much.\nThat being said, I have spent many a slow evening looking through the clothing racks and scoring on items like a Tory Burch cardigan, new Kut from the Kloth jeans, and more. But this is not the norm, it is the exception. Thrill of the hunt!\nThe housewares, furniture, and shoes are pretty run-of-the-mill. I rarely find anything.\nDO NOT GO ON THE WEEKENDS. It is a madhouse. Parents do not watch their children and I don't know if the workers say anything. \nIf I could rate the finds at this store, it would be 3/5. Mostly mall brands (huh, is that a mall across the street?) and occasionally higher-end items.\nAll in all, it's a good place to hunt, but don't be surprised if you leave empty-handed."}
{"input": "First meal in New Orleans. I had the $15 lunch special, a seafood stew (with oyster meat, crab claws, shrimp, and redfish) that came with a surprisingly thoughtful salad. Yeah, it's weird: I'm not even a fan of seafood and, to be honest, I wasn't even really that hungry. Still, before I knew what I was doing I had wolfed down the entire thing. The spice, consistency, tenderness of the meat -- all was precisely just right. Well worth your while."}
{"input": "They got me in fast, but a little careless on scratching my brand new Shimano 105 crankset.  No apologies or offers to fix.  Just let it go."}
{"input": "HipCityVeg is a vegan fast food restaurant. The food is delicious and addicting. Don't expect it to be more than what it is and you will be really satisfied with your experience. I've ordered delivery from them three times and have dined in once. The delivery was exceptionally quick, which makes me believe that most of the food is already made before you order it. It's not piping hot and fresh, but it still tastes great. The buffalo bella and fries are definitely my favorite items. If you're looking for something more upscale, try Vedge, but if you're starved and you need a quick vegan bite delivered to your office quickly, you can't go wrong with HipCity."}
{"input": "Kanella had excellent appetizers!  i would recommend the watermelon salad, the rabbit and duck sausage, the three dips and the boureki!   The decor is nice and it feels truly greek, but the noise levels are pretty high."}
{"input": "I just signed up for Yelp! because I could not find Dr. Valerie Biscardi when I searched this site looking for her.  She deserves a listing but even more so a shout out.  I left her office only 5 hours ago and already spoke to 3-4 friends about what a wonderful visit I had.  Valerie is a warm, patient, knowledgeable O.D. and I hope all her patients get the same experience I did.  I can't believe she stuck around an extra half hour helping pick out a new pair of frames for my face."}
{"input": "Enjoyed my time on the Vista . I already have another cruise scheduled on the Vista again. I am hoping to hit platinum soon. My in laws have their 50th anniversary scheduled on the Vista so I hope to make it a wonderful vacation for them."}
{"input": "Food was average at best. As experts on fried green tomatoes, my family was disappointed.  Meatloaf was good and sides average.\n\nEntertainment was disappointing too because they only played a couple songs per hour."}
{"input": "I always think it's a good sign when you go to an international place and see people of that origin eating there. Haveli was packed for the $7.99 lunch buffet. So it was a good sign for me. Plus it kept lots of fresh samosa coming. \n\nAnother great thing here is that you get fresh garlic or regular naan served table side. \n\nGood food, service, the ambiance is a little dated? With maroon carpet and industrial ceiling.. But I'm ok with it when I'm drowning myself in tikka masala and palak paneer. \n\nPro-tip- print out the coupons from website to save yourself a buck or two."}
{"input": "Great service, food was ok..  Wish the soups were served warmer, and my steak was cooked well done, when requested medium. \n\nHowever the service was excellent."}
{"input": "Horrible service. I had an appointment everything was on track, came back an hour and half later (during drop off they said it would be done) to find out they never even started my car. No phone call nothing. An hour and half after a scheduled oil change and your car was never touched. Safe to say they will never get my service."}
{"input": "I'm usually a chilaquiles girl, so the Huevos Rancheros sounded sort of tempting with its eggs, tortillas and salsa combination. Now, huevos rancheros in general has never really appealed to me, but Tavern had me changing my tune. I have a feeling that no other restaurant's version of this dish will impress me as much as this one, but if you are in Nashville and you are at Tavern for brunch and you don't get the Huevos Rancheros.... you're making a HUGE mistake. One of the best brunch meals of my life y'all..."}
{"input": "Their bird & pig sandwich is the bomb. Brie cheese is one of my favs and this sandwich offers plenty. The Asian Slaw was a suggestion from our waitress and did not disappoint. It was yummy. The sesame seeds made all the difference. Full bar always has a variety of tasty drink options. This place is cool bc it has a vegan options for those folks with those dietary needs."}
{"input": "Came here whilst waiting for the megabus to DC. It is a dim quiet bar with a small crowd of regulars and travelers. I had the buffalo chicken wrap and fries for dinner. The fries were Luke warm and the buffalo chicken wrap was spicer than expected. A decent meal if you are hungry."}
{"input": "Very nice atmosphere. Lot of space and friendly staff.  Coffee smells fresh and they also have a drive through."}
{"input": "Excellent food, good service, great location. \n\nMy wife had shrimp and grits, I had the barbecued shrimp -- both were outstanding. The appetizers were good. The bread pudding was a tad dry in the city that is supposed to be the mother lode of bread pudding. \n\nMr. B came close to snagging the fifth star but the service could have been more attentive and the place is freezing - - in July in New Orleans. Wear long sleeves or bring a jacket."}
{"input": "My first time trying Indian. I would say my neutral rating is due to the service. The waitress didn't introduce herself or any specials and didn't  explain the menu it was just a \"what do you want.\" We guessed and picked a few things, they were good. Then when the bill came she put it on the table and in under a minute came back and picked it up before we even looked at it. Waitress then said \"how are you paying\" I felt awkward because we hadn't pick it up and it was a first date and she put the bill in front of me. I was hoping my date would be chivalrous, and he was but it was uncomfortable with the waitress coming back picking it up and seeing we didn't put a card in the book yet , because we weren't ready and she kept putting the bill back down, in front of me! This happened about three times. In my prior service experience you put the check in the middle, not in front of one person especially the lady of a date. Unsure if I'll go back."}
{"input": "You know this place is great when I normally hate grits and have tried them at multiple places yet I absolutely LOVED the shrimp & grits here!!\n\nThe shrimp were totally plump and juicy and the grits were super creamy and just bursting in flavor.\n\nThe whole dish overall can be a little salty and overwhelming/heavy but it's definitely worth a visit for this dish! Best shrimp & grits I've ever had hands down."}
{"input": "Just left there...horrible service and miserable employees.  WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN. Miss Baja fresh."}
{"input": "We had a wonderful stay with our large dog and 7 year daughter. The staff was outstanding, helping us with anything we needed. The room was comfortable and the breakfast far exceeded our expectations."}
{"input": "We just happened to drive by and saw this place so we decided to stop for lunch. Once we sat down I realized this is not a place for families because it was filled with men. I soon realized the over population of male customers was because of the attractive, all female servers. The menu looked good and they had a kids menu so we decided to stay. We ordered the pretzels sticks, chicken bites, yard bird sandwich and lamb burger. Everything tasted ok nothing exceptional. The worst part was the two men sitting next to us who were drunk (literally doing shots) at 1:00pm on a Tuesday. They were older/middle aged, every other word was a swear and they were obnoxious to the servers. That's the sort of clientele this place attracts. The best part was our server though, she was very efficient and nice. \n\nLastly, the bathrooms were disgusting! Mold all over the sink like it has not had a thorough leaning in a loooooong time."}
{"input": "This place came highly recommended from some family that has been here many times. Service was fast and friendly even though they were extremely busy. Food was very tasty with mostly basic fare for breakfast.  The Cajun tasso omelet was fantastic. Not too spicy but just enough. Hash browns were fluffy and delicious. Other food at the table was French toast and eggs over medium. Everybody left satisfied and full. Will def come back for more next visit."}
{"input": "tldr; Huge plates of food. Cheap. Delicious. Get the banana pecan pancakes.\n\nSkyway Jacks is now Skyway Cafe. Same great food and service. I love the bovine decor. It really makes it feel homey. This is the kind of place that you think about when you imagine a local diner (at least my opinion of one). Everything I've eaten has been awesome. The service is good and the coffee keeps coming. \n\nThey have a morning breakfast deal between 7 and 830 am. $2.89 for 5 different combinations such as 2 eggs, pancakes and sausage (when you buy a beverage). I might have to start grabbing a little breakfast before work!\n\nSeriously, though.... get the banana pecan pancakes. You can thank me later."}
{"input": "Burrito Ranchero kicks butt and takes names.  It's not for fussy people.  Simple but tasty food.  Authentic is in the eye of the beholder folks. Nuff said........."}
{"input": "Had a business dinner here and was not disappointed. Prime location at the end of Rocky Point with amazing views of the bay from the dinner table. Atmosphere is dark and inviting and food was really great. Had the conch chowder and it was almost as good as the conch chowder I had recently in Nassau. Dinner was the pasta primavera with shrimp and get ready to eat for an army with the portion size. Nice selection of wine, I went with a really smooth glass of Sonoma Sauv Blanc. We did feel a bit underdressed in the environment but the bar with sports on television gave the white table clothes a nice relaxed balance. I will definitely eat here again and recommend to people I know."}
{"input": "Awesome meal and service. We ordered small plates and shared large plates paired with a  superb wine. The flavors were incredible and all I could say was \"I couldn't do this at home.\""}
{"input": "I thought this place was great. We stopped in for a few drinks and a plate to share and were happy with everything, especially the tacos and margaritas."}
{"input": "I've been here twice recently to choose a wedding dress and then again to choose bridesmaid dresses with my bridal party. I made an appointment for 9am first thing in the morning because I know that these places get crowded. Both times the ladies at the check-in and register were very pleasant and we were helped right away. The woman that helped me through the entire process (Yvonne) was such a pleasure to work with and always made me feel special. From the first time I tried on a dress and was so nervous, to helping my girls with their dresses, to being there when I rang the bell and said \"yes\" to the dress. I have zero complaints and would absolutely recommend this location! Again, it's always smart to do your research and if you're going to show up on a busy day, make sure it's early  (9am right when they open is a very good idea!) and that you make an appointment!"}
{"input": "This is my favorite place for Mexican! Meals always come out piping hot and delicious. We love the seafood burrito but haven't had a bad meal. The chips and salsa are mediocre but the meal makes up for them. The margarita and beer selection is also plenty and they keep pouring as requested!"}
{"input": "My boyfriend and I ate at In Riva last night. The decor and location is great, for that I'd give it a 4 Star. \nI ordered the hangar steak starter as I wasn't ravenously hungry, and my partner ordered the margherita pizza. The service was by the way, very attentive and food arrived very fast.\nMy steak was raw, tough and tasteless. Inedible. I don't even think it was hangar steak, it looked more like a sirloin tip. Took me 4 minutes to chew one small piece. The salad it came with was tasty so I just ate that and told my waitress that the steak was lousy. She offered to bring me something else, but I refused.\nThe pizza was tasty and enjoyable, but hardly memorable. \n\nTo In Riva's credit, they did not charge us for the steak dish.\n\nWe might give it another chance just becos we are local and becos we won't write off a place based on ordering two items. The ambiance, location, service etc will probably convince us to try again in a while.  If I could I would give it 2.5 stars."}
{"input": "Just left here and every single person had a warm smile on their face.  Love this place!  Great food consistently too.  I will definitely go back - even with the construction it's worth it."}
{"input": "This is a sports bar that doesn't look like a sports bar from outside. Inside is a whole different story. There are TV's everywhere and a huge bar with plenty of adult beverage options. We came here for breakfast on a busy Sunday. We were a party of six and were immediately seated. We ordered, scallops, burgers, chicken wings, fish tacos, turkey sandwich, and salads. The wings were perfectly fried with tons of flavor, the scallops were tender & fresh, the sandwich full of lots of fresh shaved turkey, the fish tacos flavorful & fresh, and the salad was fresh, crisp with very good  ranch dressing. The service was speedy and friendly. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars was because the seats in the corner booth lacked cushion. It felt like I was sitting on plywood. Please, fix this soon. I will be back to this bar and highly recommend it when in Tucson."}
{"input": "Best Greek salad I ever had, hands down. I ordered it to go, and it was packaged perfectly, dressing in portion cups, grilled chicken warm and wrapped in its own foil pouch. Veggies were all crisp and fresh and the feta was perfect. I'll def be back to test out the rest of the menu. Puts the other salad competitors to shame!"}
{"input": "I have been here numerous times for brunch, dinner and take out during lunch time hours. Staff is always friendly and the food is delicious."}
{"input": "I can't speak for anything other than breakfast but I've always enjoyed that from this place. I always end up getting an omelette since it comes with home fries, coffee AND a juice. This tops most places that don't even include any of that. \n\nLike others ensure they take your order correctly. I once ordered a Spanish omelette and ended up with a Spinach omelette with feta. It was still really good  so I didn't complain but it was definitely not what I ordered. \n\nThe delivery guy is always nice and courteous and I have no complaints there at all. I will keep coming here since I know the food and pricing includes a good amount of stuff."}
{"input": "Almost went to this location, but did a pivot turn when we had to step over three different types of trash just to get to the front door. Also trash scattered around the parking lot. Can't imagine how clean the kitchen is?"}
{"input": "One of best Thai, Malaysian , Chinese food in Philadelphia . Ecnomical, fresh, nice service, quick and efficient staff . Trendy, you would see a lot of hippy crowd, sometimes gets noisy- nice hosts, better staff- English is a little bit issue with the staff- \n\nIt's in the heart of Philly ( Chinatown ). \n\nBeen here many times, I recommend it. Try their tea at the beginning which is free of charge.\n\nUpdate : 6/17/2017. Staff was pushy, came thrice if we are done with the food- they just want you to leave as soon as possible. May be this is common in Chinatown -"}
{"input": "Great job fixing my car. Excellent work and excellent customer service. \nStaffs were friendly and approachable. Definitely highly recommend this place!!!  Great deal of discount as well! Definitely the place to go for auto body repair."}
{"input": "Born and raised in south Jersey I consider myself both a diner connoisseur and diner snob. This one is great!  A lot of locals eat here and the waitresses have worked here for quite some time. \nBreakfast and lunch are really yummy.  Food comes out quickly and service is prompt.  Really good quality food for \"just a diner\" and they recently expanded for more space- hooray! \nGreat value plan to spend about 10-14$ for a good size meal."}
{"input": "We discovered this place a few months ago and been here 3 times ao far. Everything is so delicious.  The roles are nice and soft with cinnamon butter, you can even ask for some roles to go. Too bad that we have to travel about an hour to get there."}
{"input": "We're moving out of Indy in 2 days and Revolucion was a must-try before departing. It was nothing short of phenomenal! Loved the casual, order at the bar environment and simple menu. We had the chips with salsa and guacamole - awesome - and the fish, pork, shrimp, and beef tacos. Yes, they were so good, my husband ate five. Pork and shrimp were our faves but they were all so good it was hard to decide what we liked best. Give this place your business!"}
{"input": "We encountered a short wait but were called in about10 minutes. We ordered garlic clams, clam chowder, fresh oysters and the crab sandwich. Got photos of most, except the crab sandwich as it was soooo delicious it was gone before I managed to take a photo!\n\nService is ok but super casual. \n\nGreat fresh seafood. Yum."}
{"input": "Greatly enjoyed the shellfish here. And the service is excellent.\nThe lobster roll is delicious. Clam chowder was definitely a hit. The lobster bisque was a little too heavy on the tomato, but still good. And the local rock crab was fantastic. \n\nHighly recommend this place if you're enjoying some time on the pier."}
{"input": "Panda Express is like going to a jiffy lube - you KNOW there are much better places, and your leery about going to either but you still do because its so quick and easy!!!\n\nPanda Express is OK and I love how they have the little stickers on the serving line swearing they use NO MSG - but you wonder why you bloat up after eating there??? \n\nBelieve it not I dont have any complaints about Panda Express, I think its great, its just one of those places where if you choose to go here and its not good all you can do is slap yourself and ask yourself WHAT DID YOU REALLY EXPECT and go about your day! \n\nOne thing for sure - its is REALLY quick and thats perfect when your in a hurry!"}
{"input": "Woah! This place ROCKS! \n\nI stopped here for a late lunch with my partner while visiting Philly. We are huge burger fanatics so if you aren't into burgers then just come for the drinks as these burgers can be pricy especially with the add ons. I actually went overboard with the additions and found it to be too much. My partners simple burger with cheese ended up being perfect and tasty. \n\nI enjoyed a Mint Julep (was just in the mood for one) but can say that if you are a whiskey drinker, there are soooo many options. \n\nThis place is a must for whiskey lovers!"}
{"input": "It is amazing that a restaurant can maintain its high standards and reasonable prices over so many years.  I started eating at Caruso's many years ago when I attended UA.  Upon my return to Tucson I was surprised to see that it was still open and still great!  They have a wonderful hearty red sauce which enhances every dish on which it is used.  The manicotti and parmesan dishes are outstanding.  Their house Italian dressing is my favorite anywhere.  They do have a special lunch menu.  They do not take reservations for smaller parties, so it is good to come early for weekend dinner to avoid a wait for a table."}
{"input": "This place rocks. You'd never guess it from the outside, but the food is great.  Great with kids too. We ALWAYS grab brunch and a beer when vacationing in town.  My only suggestion is they have 6 beers taps with only 3 beers running.  Fix that please!"}
{"input": "What a great experience! The courses are delicious and it's hard to make a wrong choice here. Also, a surprisingly great cocktail menu (in the top three restaurant menus I've had) and attentive staff. Every minute and every plate was amazing."}
{"input": "This was recommended by a colleague who is local in the area. A group of us from work decided to go and give it a try.  As soon as we sat down, Chris, took care of us.  He was patient, understanding and extremely knowledgeable of the menu.  Well, our entire party enjoyed every part of the evening while at Red Mess!  From the chips & salsa to the drinks to each of our entrees ... just absolutely DELICIOUS!"}
{"input": "So, so disappointed in this place. It used to be great when it first opened, but the past two times I've gone it's been terrible. The experience Villagio offers does not match up with the price of movie tickets, food, beverage, ect. If I'm paying $26 for two tickets, over $12 for food and beverage service then I expect to receive more than 1 star service AND for napkins, utensils, ect.. To be brought out with my meal. The staff looks miserable, no one seems to care about overall customer service."}
{"input": "We went on a Friday afternoon.  There was hardly anyone in the place, which was a bit worrisome initially.  However once we got our food and drinks soon realized this place was great!\n\nThe waitstaff was excellent.  We had 2 different servers, as we stayed for a long time and the first waitress was getting off.  Our service was seamless.  The food was good, but the presentation of each dish was not what food critics would consider visually stunning.  The nachos were freaking huge!  As a nacho connoisseur I found this to be delightful.  The drinks were very good and they have a nice house drink menu.\n\nThe view of John's pass is really nice.  They have an outdoor area with a few seats that would be good in less windy weather than we experienced.  This would also be a good place to park your boat and come in for a bite to eat."}
{"input": "Three from my office had lunch delivered from San Antonio Taco today.  It was our first time from there.  The food did not live up to the reviews.  Three of us ordered sides of refried beans and rice.  All 3 thought the beans were much too salty and the rice was clumpy.  I had beef enchiladas.  The beef was cut with the grain instead if against it so it was stringy and inedible.  I will generally give a restaurant a second try but not sure I will this time."}
{"input": "Best breakfast in Idaho! The most delicious breakfast burrito or breakfast sandwich, but also the more traditional breakfasts like eggs Benedict are fantastic. Elegant presentation and everything is made from scratch. The charming old building is a fully renovated church cathedral. The coffee bar is spot on too, you would think it's a dedicated coffee shop."}
{"input": "We stayed during the aftermath of Hurricane Irma.  Everybody working was upbeat and helpful.\n\nWe enjoyed a few meals in the restaurant well prepared and good portions."}
{"input": "Let me start by saying that the food here is by far the best Mexican I have had in St Pete.  It's nothing fancy and very small but if your looking for some good food and a beer this is the place to go to. Weekend nights do get a little hectic so I would recommend going on a weekday night or during the day so you can skip the long wait to place your order. For the meat lovers out there you can't go wrong with a chorizo taco and for the seafood junkies the fish tacos are amazing!"}
{"input": "Had the rock crab, oysters, and sea urchin. Every dish tasted like heaven. The beer was ice cold and the staff was so nice. Our pup joined us sitting outside and enjoyed a smidge of crab for herself. I love this place"}
{"input": "I came from out of state to attend an annual New Years party at my in-laws. This year theme was \"prom\". I asked the ladies to make me a corsage and boutonnière for my wife and I, and I asked them to make sure it was fun, large, not your typical classy and clean but loud and obnoxious due to the style of the party. I let them have their way and these ladies NAILED it! Thank you!!"}
{"input": "This is the best place in this entire area for breakfast we will come here over and over again \nService is amazing \nFood is great \nThe portion sizes for your buck are unbeatable \nKeep up the good work Cracker Barrel we love you"}
{"input": "We have been ordering from them for about a year. Their prices are decent and the food has usually always been great. My wife loves the poppers and we both love the chicken tenders.\n\nThe owner seems like he really cares about the customers. We had a few mistakes in our orders over the years and the owner is very apologetic and fixes the problem right away."}
{"input": "I was very impressed with the service here. Unfortunately he only had one tire for me in the size i needed,  so he rotated the bad tire to the back of my auto. He was very helpful and nice. I will be back again."}
{"input": "Very unhappy with the treatment we received today. After eating a Sushi Rose since it opened up, and their parent restaurant Asian Wok next door, we have never had a sushi chief be so rude and inhospitable. Flower was the acting manager today. She almost permanently lost our business had it not been for the kind service of the waitress."}

{"input": "Super quick,easy,tasty and consistent. Their lunch specials are something to crave and offer great value. Always try for a booth if available. Their wifi password is 80545517722"}
{"input": "This is one of my favorite restaurants. The ambience is great and appropriately small. The menu options are nice, and I ordered the steak au jus and truffle oil fries. I could keep going back only for the truffle oil fries. It is absolutely the best. The service is excellent as well. I dropped my fork, and the waiter appeared with a new fork in a flash like the butler on Mr. Deeds. I will definitely return for the third time, and highly recommend this restaurant for when you are in downtown St. Pete!"}
{"input": "Yummy takoyaki! Finally I found a Japanese restaurant in Philadelphia area that isn't a sushi / tempura joint!\n\nWent there last Saturday, ordered 2 type of tako balls. Original and BBQ flavor. Both in octopus.. since the real takoyaki supposed to be only using octopus as its' meat. But they have other choices of meat in case you don't eat octopus. Like chicken, beef and such.\n\n1 order of takoyaki consist of 6 balls, cost around $5. Both are very yummy, though I like the original more.\n\nI will definitely go back for more and try on their Yakisoba.\n\nMake sure you put one hour on your parking meter if you order more than just one kind. It took 20 minutes for 2 orders of different flavor takoyaki.\n\nI didn't see the problem with super heavy dough or some sort which encountered by other yelpers though. I think everything just perfect!"}
{"input": "Atmosphere was nice and the fish tank was awesome. Service was bad and food was mediocre. The main dining room was about half full and that was all they could accommodate because they didn't have the staff. Ended up sitting at the bar. Got the fish tacos and there was very little fish actually in there. Not impressed :( had high hopes"}
{"input": "Food was awesome! Some of the best brunch food I've ever had. Comfortable chairs and good atmosphere. Their coffee is amazing and you can order it while you wait! Lost a star because I witnessed a guy who works there be a complete jerk to a customer. I'm not a \"customer service\" person and don't really care if people are rude, but this guy was ridiculous. Besides that, everyone else was cool and the food was fantastic."}
{"input": "I have frequented the Mad Mex, University City location for years.  I was pleased to see this new location which is closer to my home and I don't have to deal with the obnoxious students.  I have been here for Happy Hour and just for dinner at another time.  It has been busy both times and it seems that the staff need to be trained a little more in chaos and crowd management.  The best deals are during Happy Hour - the $3, $5 & $7 Margarita's.  I also believe wings are 1/2 off.  My friends seemed to enjoy their orders of Burritos, Gaucamole and enchiladas.  \n\nThe food is average and for the price of drinks - it would be a great place to hang if the service improves."}
{"input": "Chicken was awesome! Loved the char and the garlic marinade. I can't say the same for the rest of the meal! Rice was cold but flavorful and probably would have tasted better if it was warm and dryer. The hummus was average and the falafel was just awful. I'm Arab so I know my fair share of felafel. This was not even acceptable in my standards for America! Everything was fresh though which is why I gave it a 3 + epic chicken. Not worth the wait and the possible risk of being yelled at. Too much hype for just the experience.\n\nPS: if you want real falafel and epic hummus, walk down the street to Mama's."}
{"input": "Tucked into a corner of a busy shopping center, the place was nearly empty when we walked in, but several other couples came in as we ate. The lunch menu, a mere two pages, seemed a bit limited. I ordered a meatball ricotta sandwich with salad, while my dad had a chicken Parmesan sandwich with homemade Parmesan fried potato chips. The salad was very fresh, with nice greens and homemade dressing. The potatoes, not quite as crisp as ordinary potato chips, were quite good. The meatballs were well above average, nicely seasoned and with generous but not overwhelming cheese. The chicken Parm looked rather flat, and my Dad did not finish it, proclaiming it \"not for me.\" We finished up with Spumoni, very prettily presented with slivered almonds and a light drizzle of strawberry sauce. Service was friendly and attentive."}
{"input": "Decided to come by here based on yelp reviews...it was decent, not a place that wowed me. We ordered the BBQ oysters and the charbroiled oysters - both were good but not out of the world amazing. The charbroiled oysters at ACME are better. I ordered the shrimp carbonara po boy and it was ok. Very large and I couldn't finish it. The hubby ordered a burger and he was happy. It wasn't the best but he thought it was good. The service was fine but it was a pain to get my water refilled. Overall, food was ok...not memorable, I'll forget it when I leave. I would stop by if you're starving and can't wait. If you can, go somewhere else."}
{"input": "It was a blah place, grill mahi sandwich was decent, chips good, waffle fries not so good...the atmosphere was mediocre, wait staff was fine so I may go again for a drink but that is probably it!"}
{"input": "I visited this store a few months ago, and they were extremely friendly.  Bought my new phone there.   If I lived in that area, I would only visit this store.  However, I visited a location in Texas as the service was terrible.  This Sparks location was worth my trip and purchase experience.  thanks"}
{"input": "I went here with a friend who had a Groupon.  The sushi was horrible, full of filler breadcrums and very skimpy on fish.  They took a lot of time and care to decorate the plate with fresh orchids and I wish that they would have invested this extra money into giving us more fish in our rolls."}
{"input": "Found myself here after last call. It was super crowded, but the staff was great and the food hit the spot. My burger was a little rarer than medium rare, but I was into it. Fries were good. Crowd was annoying, drunk and rude but the cook was CUTE, so no complaints!"}
{"input": "Every time we are in South Tampa, Louis Pappas is our go-to for good food and good service.  My wife and I are huge fans of the Cuban sandwich, and I have had a few other items from the menu.  All of them leave us happy and wanting to come back for more.  \n\nThe atmosphere is pleasant and the place is always amazingly clean.  All my interactions with the staff, most especially the management, are first class and personable.\n\nYou can't go wrong with Louis Pappas!"}
{"input": "Le Chandelier Salon and Boutique offers quality service and expertise that will blow you away. From my wedding trial to my wedding day, I have nothing but positive words to say. Le Chandelier's hair/makeup artists are wonderful!! They came to our venue the morning of our wedding and their professionalism and creativeness was remarkable. Thank you to the owner and to all of the staff for making the day such a calm and relaxed atmosphere. I highly recommend their services to anyone!"}
{"input": "Fun, Fun! Best place to dance, drink and just have a great time.  I ate here but, that's not why you come here, it's after work socializing !!!  Ah Patron Tequila - you are my best friend!  Very clubby without the pretentiousness!"}
{"input": "The only benefit to coming here is large portion size. Four of us went, we got spicy chicken, lomein, fried rice and the ahi bowl. The ahi bowl was ok, the rest was absolute garbage. All of the dishes were very bland, you would be better off getting the frozen Chinese food in the grocery store. Never coming back."}
{"input": "My boyfriend and i tried out this place and we were surprised how good the food and service was despite it being packed! My boyfriend ordered a hot pot soup and it was delicious. I had the pad Thai and love it. Very fast and attentaive service. The vibe of the place is pretty cool too, make sure to get outdoor seating, it's beautiful and worth the wait."}
{"input": "I've never felt compelled to write a review for anything before until I came here. The food was good, but that's a known fact about this cafe. But the service is the reason why this place gets my first review ever. \n\nI've never been here so the set up was new to me. But the first person I came across was super helpful behind the counter, ready to explain what each item was and didn't feel annoyed by all my (probably super silly) questions. \n\nThe next person and the main reason for my review was the waiter. He made the experience! He was beyond helpful. He even went out of his way to surprise my friends and I with those free pastry receipts only because it was our first time there. And when I went to go tip him he was so surprised that he was receiving anything. But he deserved it! And more if I had more to give. \n\nLoved this place. Never been so satisfied and happy with any place I've gone to. \n\nEveryone should check it out and I hope you all get the waiter I got!"}
{"input": "P Chart:\n\nPlace: 4\nReally good looking French country feel but not over done. They also have a great patio which is perfect on nice days. Good for a casual date\n\nPeople: 4\nNice, quick and attentive. Waiter came through with a custom choice off the menu during a busy breakfast rush\n\nProvisions: 5\nFood was terrific. Very fresh and flavorful eggs bene was killer and was the grass fed  silver burger. Nothing here disappoints. \n\nPrice: 5\nGreat food at a reasonable rate. Tough to find this quality at this price. \n\nPerformance: 5 \nGet the bacon!  With so little choice for great food on the main line this one ranks among the best for great semi casual food. You will be very pleased and will return"}

{"input": "Wish I would have came on Yelp and read the previous reviews, it would've saved me a lot of time and frustration. I ran in today to see if someone could take a look at my right passenger front wheel. My tire pressure light was on and I noticed a piece of tire was lifted. I go in and he tells me it's a couple hours wait. Ok, I'll give you that I just showed up so the wait thing is to be expected. I ask the guy if I can make an appointment to come back. He says its first come first serve. Really? When I've made appts previously with other Just Tires? Why not just say you don't want my service? Bottom line? Guy was rude and lacked any customer service. Went down the street to Mr. Tire and was in and out with a replaced new tire in half an hour. Oh, and they appeared WAY busier based on the waiting area and cars in the garage."}
{"input": "The food was good but towards the ends my family and I were splitting the bill and they charged my family the the right amount but ran my credit card last and charged me the full amount of $250 I talked with the director and all he can say is i don't know what to say we'll refund it but will take a few days. I don't have of couple of days for $250.  I told them I'm not from here and I just can't come back if something is wrong and all the director could say is sorry can't help you."}
{"input": "Food is delicious and authentic. I've ordered the papaya salad, chicken wings, and beef salad (all served with sticky rice). All are prepared Laosian style. I'm Thai so I love spicy, but I ordered my papaya salad medium and it was more like Thai-hot. Go with the mild! My friend ordered the pho and was impressed. All their drinks and delicious and the shaved ice is a must have for hot Florida days. \n\nThe place is very clean and efficiently run, will return to try the Banh-mi."}
{"input": "So let me say that I dreaded car shopping, but after dealing with SB Toyota, my mindset has completely changed.  I'm big on research, so prior to purchasing my new Prius I compared prices by emailing dealers all over from San Francisco to LA, figuring I'd have to go down to LA to get the best price.  To my surprise, Toyota SB had the lowest price and the salesperson emailing me, Freddy Barajas, was super patient--keeping in touch via email but without any pressure to buy.  Other dealerships were calling a lot, using the typical smarmy lines that give car salespeople a bad reputation.  This was absolutely not the case at SB Toyota.  When I went on the test drive with Derek Gibson, he was super knowledgeable, helpful, but again I felt no pressure.  Finally buying the car was so simple and all my friends are amazed at the price I paid...I can't recommend these folks enough."}
{"input": "Last May, my wife and I used Jump on the School Bus to take our wedding guests on a winery and brewery tour. They were just amazing, the perfect choice for our pre-wedding wine and beer tour and for wedding transportation between Goleta and the Circle Bar-B Ranch for our guests who stayed in town. Darin and Sierra did a wonderful job communicating with us in Washington, DC as we planned our wedding itinerary. They were flexible about trip times and made last minute adjustments when the number of in-town guests changed suddenly. \n\nDarin and Sierra have such attention to detail and quality that Darin even stopped by one of the wineries to meet us and to ensure that everything was as expected. Our driver was also extremely knowledgeable about the area and had many good suggestions throughout the day.\n\nWe couldn't have picked a better choice for a winery, brewery day tour and wedding day transportation than Jump on the School Bus! I highly recommend them to everyone!"}
{"input": "I love this place!!! Great selection of beer on tap that always changes and perfect pub food. It's my go-to for Sunday nite dinner or Sat. lunch."}
{"input": "Great place to go after work for industry people with a 11-2 happy hour. Def recommend the one-two punch and what an asprin!"}
{"input": "All those cereal commercials are lying to you. A balanced breakfast doesn't consist of milk, OJ, cereal, and a banana. If you want a balanced breakfast, you should hop in line for fried chicken, a glazed donut, and coffee from FedNuts.  \n\nI'm not much of a sweet breakfast person, but the donuts are great here. The chicken is wonderful, no matter how you have it dressed - wet or dry, they're all good. And when you're eating chicken and donuts for breakfast you're probably going to need something to get you moving afterwards; the coffee.\n\nOh, and don't try to convince someone to come with you that needs an explanation on why those two foods are served together. Those people don't deserve it."}
{"input": "Cute little shop with fun decor, but don't miss the GREAT cupcakes!! Had good and very friendly service and will be back... though no often due to being a little pricy!"}
{"input": "With all the talk of bbq tips, sweetie pie, etc of St. Louis...I decided to try this place after flying in. The customer service was great, they make their own BBQ sauce which is between a sweet, tangy with pinch of spice. It could be considered overpowering if not used to it. The pull pork sandwich was recommended along with beans and Cole slaw. Again, this could be too much for one who has never tried it and/or intake this type of food on a daily basis."}
{"input": "I love this store! Each time I'm in Carpenteria (monthly) I visit this store and it's juice/smoothie/sandwich bar daily. Sometimes twice daily... except Sunday because they aren't open. *sad*\n\nI love their Alien's Nectar and Green Lantern Juices - I'm addicted! Their acai bowls are out of this world delicious. Also when they make a smoothie with dates it ends up smooth (versus the place across the street that can't seemml to make juice or smoothies that flow easily up straws!)\n\nGet the cocoa-nut smoothie with date butter..  you won't be sorry fellow chocolate lovers. Or one if the pineapple coconut smoothies... oh so good!\n\nThe prices at this store are on par with other natural grocers. Staff is super friendly and I swear they put extra love in each item. Tip them! \n\nI wish they were open Sunday!"}
{"input": "This tour is one to take when you want to have a lazy day, but you want to do a passive activity.  Me & my friends didn't wan the lunch, we just wanted to take a tour of the Mississippi.  The cost was average - around $28.00.  Con:  Remember it is a tour, so they have the typical tourist traps - photographer - me and friends declined that option.  \n\nI would suggest if you aren't going to eat - to pull out your smartphone and research the Natchez Native American Tribe who inhibited the area prior to the colonization of the New Orleans area - interesting \"tid bits of rituals\", so that made the boat ride more fun because I became the secondary tour leader to my group.  If you are in the mood-go get a drink and this will comfort you as you learn more about the area on a steamboat.  Not a bad way to spend a few hours."}
{"input": "Pros: \n- Convenient for when you're looking to feed an overworked sleep-deprived film crew at 6AM on a Sunday on a tight budget\n\nCons:\n- Food is so bad that even overworked sleep-deprived film crew would rather starve \n- Eggs tasted like paper, toast tasted like cardboard, potatoes felt like decomposing fruits (not that I would know)\n\nI cannot understand how they can mess up the most basic sides.. but hey, I guess they're not exactly known for their eggs, toast, and potatoes\n\nPaying a bit more for Dunkin' Donuts sandwiches/croissants is much more worth it."}
{"input": "The beer garden alone is worth 5 stars! When I first came here I didn't realize they have a whole beer garden in the back with so many selections where you can even build your own 6 packs!\nLove this place! It's definitely my go to for beer now!"}
{"input": "Best donut shop in STL!!! Family owned, clean, truly great service by people that care and know you! The donuts are amazing. Handmade every morning! It's packed every day. Great breakfast sandwiches too!"}
{"input": "Ordered an iced mocha  and an iced white chocolate mocha and they were both was awful.  They  had NO coffee flavor or chocolate flavor at all, very watered down.  Even went back and asked the girl to add another shot and why.  I think she remade them, instead of just adding another shot.  Still had NO flavor.  Not even sure how you could make it that bad.  We both ended up throwing them away on the way out.  So sad, not even worth drinking."}
{"input": "Ask for Phil...I have read some reviews that have called him a bit of a Chatty Kathy and it's true. However, the service he provides is stellar. His reccomendations are good...I enjoy the octopusm but last time it was a bit overdone. You can eat here cheaply if you want just a little something. I tend to spend about a hundred bucks for 2 people, but have a bottle of wine and desert, not to mention numerous tapas. Try it, you'll like it.\n\nI gave 4 stars because it has no private space for parties. That is a big negative"}
{"input": "If you go to New Orleans this place is a must enjoy great music really cool atmosphere and when you notice that is nothing electronic in there is definitely a mind blowing feeling like a time machine"}
{"input": "Terrible service. Called in an order for pick up and completely butchered my order. I asked for a half sausage half cheese pizza and felt like he had no clue what i was saying as i had to constantly repeat myself. i had my boyfriend call back to make sure the order was right and he repeated back the order that i ordered half sausage half BEEF??? So after we corrected him and picked up or pizza, we got back and opened it up and it was ALL SAUSAGE. This is the second time in the past month i have had terrible service. The first time i got there for pickup and they had completely forgotten to put my order in. Terrible."}
{"input": "I've been a regular at Henry's for the past couple of years. This fabulous local spot has great, affordable bottomless cups of coffee and a wide selection of delicious sandwiches and salads. I had the BLT bagel for lunch today and it changed my life. Lots of crispy bacon, fresh tomato, and a yummy avocado aioli spread served with a side of fresh strawberries -- a perfect summer lunch. \n\nHenry's has a great atmosphere and is friendly to work-at-homers like me who need to get out of the house occasionally. You'll see a mix of people on laptops plus locals hanging out or having meetings. Friendly and spunky staff will remember your order and serve it up with a smile (or some good-natured ribbing).\n\nDon't miss Henry's on East!"}
{"input": "Jhonny's is incredibly honest and trustworthy. They could have tried to tell me that I had a rat problem and needed to pay $750 like the other pest control company that came out. However; Tony took time to explain to us how to set bait boxes at no extra charge to keep our home rat free since we live near mountains and a creek. Highly recommend!"}
{"input": "While I like that this HMV location sells vinyl, they do have it priced quite high.  I guess this is for the people who want to purchase LPs but only doing their shopping at the mall (vs. hitting the independents on Whyte) and don't mind paying a little more for their vinyl. \n\nAs for other items - CDs/DVDs/Books/BluRays -  if the item is on sale, then it is usually a good price, and most popular items are on sale.  Any item that is not on sale (the more unusual selections, or less popular items) is usually way overpriced.\n\nBeing the largest HMV in the city, the selection is pretty good, though I do find they still fall into that \"stock only the GREATEST HITS or BEST OFs instead of back catalogue\" mentality that all chains seem to buy into.\n\nStaff is friendly and the lines are quick - this can be a pretty busy location - so if you need to buy from HMV, this is a good location."}
{"input": "Very convenient for some craving or emergency cooking needs.  Their prices are higher but they try to carry more specialty items. I have never noticed this but I've heard from others in my building to always ask for a receipt just in case the charge comes over wrong.  I highly recommend checking this place out to find new and exotic choices you wouldn't usually see or think to buy.  The fact that it is in downtown is one of the most appealing aspects to this place!"}
{"input": "I wanted somewhere new for Cinco de Mayo and had never been here. \n\nOverall, it was okay. I liked how you could customize the guacamole-adding crab, tomatoes, garlic, etc but I thought the guac was a little bland still. The chicken tacos were good but nothing special. The margaritas were also just okay-maybe I'm used to flavored ones.\n\nWould I come back here? Yes. Would it be my first choice for Mexican? No."}
{"input": "This place was soooo good. I went for breakfast because my sister who lives here did it's the best place to go for breakfast. I ordered the country Benedict and it was awesome! I also had a pancake and that was delicious. I love brunch and breakfast food so this place hit the spot for sure! \n\nIt's a little loud cause it's very open and has a cement floor so it echos a bit. \n\nFood is great, service was great no complaints!"}
{"input": "What an amazing find this little place is. \nWe had time before our Busch tour and since Sage is right across the street, we decided to try it. I can say again how glad I am that we did.\nThere were 3 of us and we each decided on something different. One got the Asian wrap and made 'yum' noises the entire time we ate. I opted for the Fried Tilapia Reuben - a strange idea if I ever heard one. It was so good that I havent stopped talking about it since I got back. Something about the richness of the batter with the fattiness of the oil made it so reminiscent of Rubens that it was amazing (of course, I havent had a real Ruben since I started keeping kosher some 30+ years ago, so that might have something to do with it as well)\nThe sweet potato fires that accompanied each of our dishes was also a standout. While they have become almost ubiquitous, these seemed to be made from scratch and not just purchased frozen bagful at a time.\nI'd go back in a St Louis minute"}
{"input": "If your looking for just plain good food this is the place, biscuits and gravy are the best gravy is home made. Nothing fancy here just great food. Breakfast served all the time. Real down home cooking will go back again."}
{"input": "Super friendly people and workers here!!! The food is great but they only two cooks and they work their hardest I come here every time I'm in the mood for something fast and delicious. They have a wide selection of stir fry and drinks with great pho. Don't listen to the bad reviews they obviously think it's a rich people place it's a great place."}
{"input": "Hard to beat the price ($8 to see a movie in 3D? Yes, please), but you get what you pay for. Overall I was actually happy with the lobby area, and the projector and sound system within the theater were quite nice, but the seats were worn down so far that you could feel the metal bars in your back. I'm young enough that this usually wouldn't be a problem, but I could definitely feel the metal for a few hours after the movie was over. The smell of the theater was definitely not the best either; something between stale popcorn and sweat. Still, considering that this theater can be anywhere from 30 - 40% cheaper than many other nearby options while having comparable, if not better, sound and projection quality than, for example, the Painters Crossing AMC, I'll probably be coming back."}
{"input": "I just don't get it. Waiting an hour in line for mediocre pancakes, eggs that are under seasoned, and bleh coffee? I get it's a Nashville institution, but our city has better to offer these days."}
{"input": "I just started going to Sushi Nara this month (they opened just a short time ago).  I love this place; it is clean, the staff are friendly and acommodating, and the service is fast.  The sushi is always delicious ((I've been here 3 times) and the prices are reasonable. In fact, this week my husband stopped in for take out, bought 4 sushi rolls and the total was $24.  That is amazing.  \n\nI love the freshness of the food and there's a huge selection to choose from.\n\nEveryone on the eastside, check this place out!"}
{"input": "This is a must try, we come here frequent and we are never disappointed. Get there early so you get right in and don't have to wait. Decent selection of coffees, they have french press as well. Menu isn't huge which is nice so you can figure out what you want quickly. Food comes how in a decent time. I seem to always get the same thing (wilburt skillet) everytime I go cause it is amazing. Food just seems so fresh as well, friendly staff. You will leave full and a smile on your face."}
{"input": "Burger Up is, by far, one of our favorite restaurants in the Nashville area.  It has a cool hipster vibe, without being annoying :)  The burgers are outstanding, and there are endless options, whether you prefer beef, chicken, seafood, or veggie!  I would recommend the Woodstock - the Jack Daniels Maple Ketchup is out of this world, and Benton's bacon is always delicious.  Upgrade to the truffle fries; they're to die for.  Or, if you're a vegetarian, the troyathalon is a great option.  Filling, with great texture and flavor.  As far as drinks go, 12 South Lemonade.\n\nThe customer service is also great.  They've always been attentive, but not \"on top of you\", and they're very knowledgable about their food.  Parking can be a bit difficult at certain times of the day, but it's worth a short walk if necessary.\n\nI would definitely recommend checking it out!"}
{"input": "I'm surprised at how sleep at the wheel the Snyders became. Bobby Clark destroyed our team as a GM. Fluxuated old Flyers technique around the NHL, and trapped us with nontradeables tied to long and nonbreakable contracts, in fact I never seen the guy score, personally. Our history has better Emric players than that guy. OFF WITH HIS HEAD"}
{"input": "Really disappointed-quality that I experienced years ago gone. Way too salty-fries, salmon, blooming onion not good. Big on unhealthy food-drinks and sweets."}
{"input": "Both the sweet and savory crepes here are DELICIOUS! So many choices and hard to pick which one is best. The teas they have are also wonderful. This is a quiet, quaint little place with the sweetest wait staff. I've been going here for years and would recommend to everyone wanting to have a casual meal in an unpretentious setting."}
{"input": "I had three dogs here because they are that good. I had the Dave's Style, the western, and the Pizza Dog. The pizza dog is amazing! I highly recommend Dave's Dog!"}
{"input": "The food was excellent, no complaints at all there. I was very happy with the hostesses as well. The waitstaff was okay for the most part. I would have been more happy if they stopped by a bit more than they did.\n\nCertainly a must visit when in the city."}
{"input": "Love this place! It was my first time here a couple weeks ago but every single hair seems to be growing in just fine. Molly cut my hair and did a great job. From the reviews it seems as though everyone there is great though. I heard through the grape vine and reading other reviews on here they offer you a glass of wine, beer, or rum. But for some reason I was only offered a glass of water or coffee. As a home brewer myself and total beer geek I was totally bummed I wasn't offered the beer but totally got over it with the great service, hospitality, and overall atmosphere there. \n\nHighly recommend this place.\n\nWent back a couple more times, and had a bad experience the last time."}
{"input": "The service was great and everything definitely tasted very fresh. I especially liked the guacamole!\n\nI tried the mole and mango chicken tacos and I felt they lacked just a little bit of flavor. I'll definitely go back though and try some different varieties."}
{"input": "Can't tell you how happy I was to see see Heather finally open a shop...I've followed her as a client for years. She is a color wizard, a genius at crafting a look with flair just for you, and can make a tasteful and creative suggestion if you're stumped, or roll with your personal vision. On top of that, Heather has created a shop vibe that is unstuffy, chill, and totally comfortable. I trust her and the staff she hires when I recommend friends and family, and love that she's made a home in the heart of E. Passyunk. Ask her for tips on caring for cactus houseplants, or chat about vintage bikes when you visit."}
{"input": "WOW!  The food is oh so good.  I've eaten at a lot of plant based food restaurants at different locations all around Philadelphia and the surrounding counties.   Hands down HipCityVeg has the best tasting vegan food that I've ever tasted.  It is my new lunch spot.  The Philly Steak and carrot ginger drink was absolutely delicious!  I had my food delivered to my job and it arrived way before the estimated delivery time provided.  Two thumbs up, I highly recommend HipCityVeg."}
{"input": "Looking for something tasteless, greasy, and overpriced?! Head on over to George's Sandwich Shop! What a disaster. The roast pork sandwich is listed as $7.00, fine, but any sandwich-eater worth their salt (or pepper) knows that a sandwich isn't complete without some toppings, and George's sticks it to you ever-so-casually: \"Anything on that?\" Unsuspecting customers will be charged on top of the $7 for what should be basic, included toppings. This would be acceptable if the sandwich had any semblance of decency, yet it is completely revolting from first glance to last choked bite.The bread was completely soggy and drenched in oil that was hot enough to burn my hand. The pork was entirely flavorless, the provolone and broccoli rabe couldn't even save it. I regret wasting my appetite on this disgrace of a sandwich. Do yourself a favor and go down the street to Paesano's instead."}
{"input": "Nothing too special about this bar that makes it different from any other bar, but they do serve Hand Grenades and those are really good (frozen or on the rocks)."}
{"input": "I should have listened to all the negative reviews; but it was hard to imagine a business could really be this bad. This one is. Almost two weeks to have a pair of shoes repaired; just a bit of stitching on one heel. Returned today to find my shoes had not been repaired, had not even been looked at. It took me 5 trips to this store; each time ensuring me that the shoes would be done the next day....\nDO NOT TAKE YOUR SHOES HERE FOR REPAIR! It is really the worst customer service I have had in my life."}
{"input": "Eh not the greatest bar in the world, totally think this place is kinda boring! I do appreciate the security for this club but as far as fun bars there are far better! I don't really enjoy hookah so it's not there for me and prices and happy hour don't draw me in! As far as I'm concerned I only follow friends in, not go by myself! Not to mention o.o it's proximity to other clubs puts it in the \"eh\" category! I don't want to totally trash the place so I do want to praise the couches and staff! The employees I've had the pleasure of meeting are spectacular and for that I give them the 3 stars! Please don't let my review deter you from enjoying this place, perhaps I just haven't gave it enough of a chance! I have had a few good times here!"}
{"input": "DUDE. I love Gianna's. The staff was really nice, the place is small but it's homey. AND THE FOOD. I love the food. I first went here when I was vegetarian, and until this day I hadn't had any veg product that had this much flavor."}
{"input": "I have been there once for lunch and had dinner there tonight. Casual atmosphere and not too fancy. The buffet is small and did not offer dessert except for grapes. We did not have the rotisserie since that was an added price but everything coming around looked fantastic. Although the buffet was small (3 meats, a noodle dish, 2 different stews, plantains, 2 soups  and a 4 indlgredient salad bar) everything was good. They sell some groceries at the register...we bought a few things. I will come back again."}
{"input": "Good food. Certainly better than some of the other Chinese food in the area. The restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly. My food was ready on time and the price was quite reasonable. I'll be making Super Wok my go-to restaurant for Chinese take-out."}
{"input": "Went here for dinner, got the crab claws, gumbo and jambalaya pasta. Was really disappointed in everything. Everything came out like warm and not hot. The crab claws were the only thing that was good. The gumbo was not good at all. Our jambalaya came out and had a hair\nIn it! We couldn't eat that and had to return it. The manager came out and all they did was apologize. That doesn't make up for me leaving still hungry. \n\nSuch a disappointing experience and won't be back here. \n\nNext time take care of your customers and make sure that you do something besides offer an apology for ruining our dinner."}
{"input": "By far the best place in the northeast and not over price, great show, best hibachi I've even been to. The atmosphere is amazing and everyone is so welcoming. I alway try to go here any chance I get."}
{"input": "Absolutely amazing! Must get the black garlic wings - they are to die for! My brisket ramen was delicious as well, I can not wait to come back!"}
{"input": "Food is below average. Waiter is unfriendly.. I asked which dishes are less spicy, he said dismissively: all of them are spicy because Indian food is spicy.. OK, they never brought a chutney tray and we never asked. They constantly were out of naan which wasn't very flavorful. Yeah, that's the last time for us. The decor was colorful. That's what the one star is for."}
{"input": "Fantastic little spot. Love all their specialty drinks and how effort the baristas put into them. They have free WiFi and plenty of places to sit and get some work done. Place fills quickly on the weekends. Would definitely make this my regular spot if I lived closer."}
{"input": "We're new to the area, so we're exploring restaurants every weekend. My wife has already proclaimed The Roost her favorite, and that's based on many years of breakfast dining, not just in this area. They bake all their own breads and pastries. Try the raisin bread or sugar-cinnamon toast. Yum! The cornbread casserole is another dish my wife and I highly recommend. And the service was prompt, attentive and very friendly. Enjoy!"}
{"input": "What has happened to Target?  I shop weekends and my experience starts with walking into a hot store. Then I have to weasel my way around all the employees stocking shelves with huge flatbeds that block the aisles. I can't ever get everything on my list as there are always out of stocks and heaven forbid I ask a stocker for help! I then end pulling up to a long line at checkout, max ever 2 checkers, I am then asked to self-check. I am guessing limiting checkers is a ploy to force this..my answer is always no and usually everyone around me! With all the online competition I would think making the in store experience would be high in the list of priorities!"}
{"input": "Such good coffee! And I love the vibe in here - it reminds me of a quirky coffee house that would be in Portland. They take their time making you your drink too. Favorite in St. Pete!"}
{"input": "If parking doesn't shy you away this location is quite quaint it has enough little table seating outside and inside to allow for a great business meeting or a coffee with a friend.  Staff is pretty friendly and they  haven't got my order wrong yet so got to give it four stars for that!"}
{"input": "The view was nice and the location was convenient. Also, the front desk representatives were friendly. Those are the positives. The main reason for the 2 stars is the housekeeping staff. Both mornings of our stay we were awoken by someone from the housekeeping staff at 8:30am trying to open our door DESPITE the Do Not Disturb sign being on the door. The second morning we were first woken up at 7am by an alarm that we did not set. It was not set the first day and was the second...and we absolutely did not set it (didn't need an alarm).  Cleanliness of the room was average at best, but it was the ignoring of the DND sign and the setting of the alarms that will prevent us from booking here again."}
{"input": "Beautiful old theater that puts on excellent performances!"}
{"input": "At $45, the prix fixe option is totally worth it. The foie gras soup is not to be missed. Service was attentive but not intrusive. Make a reservation before you go."}
{"input": "The staff were exceptionally courteous (the front desk for check-in could follow suit with personality more though). The hotel was very clean, especially the rooms, and nothing was taken/stolen during cleaning when we were gone. There was a locked mini bar and a safe located in the room but no fridge. The restaurants and cafe were great to match the service of its hotel. We stayed here for our anniversary and recommend it to anyone looking for a great location, and great place to stay on Bourbon! I could have gave it 5 but the manager said a complimentary bottle of champagne would be in our room but we never received it for our special day. Nevertheless it's a great stay!"}
{"input": "I loved this place!  We drove down from Tahoe just to eat here!  The 90 miles round trip was worth it!  The food was that good!  The Chicken Basil was the best!  And they have good Boba Tea!\n\nDon't believe the nay-sayer about this place.  The food was pretty authentic Taiwanese.  Try it and see for yourself!"}
{"input": "Its a great place for Brunch.\nWe tried the Wildflower Triple where you can substitute any of the 3 items with sausage or biscuit or anything else. We couldn't figure out which one we wanted to try, so this choice was easy! \nThe food was spectacular and the service was very friendly! \nWe are here for two more days, so we might come back tomorrow or the day after."}
{"input": "Room was clean, bed was comfortable. We checked in late on a Saturday night as we were traveling and so were several others at the time. Location is close to the highway and the mall, so it was convenient. Hotel was very nice.\nThere's a bar downstairs with some very loud patrons, but not unruly. Drinks were pricey, but they were worth it. Theur food is a little on the high end, but I can't speak to quality as I didn't order. Their late night menu had some great options though.\n\nWill definitely stay again next time we travel through the area."}
{"input": "This is the second time we tried turning point at this location. The first time we had a long wait for food after ordering, this time we had an even longer wait of over 40 minutes. I had the omelette skillet and there was hardly any egg in it, I felt like I was eating chopped onions and chopped tomatoes. My wife had a BLT and had a hard time finding the tomato and the avocado that was supposed be on it. Overall,The experience was stressful, mainly because of the long wait."}
{"input": "The great customer service that you get here, you won't find in another to-go Asian/Thai restaurant. I enjoyed the food! The curry had great flavor and consistency. The shrimp fried rice does not look appealing but it is flavorful and fluffy. I dropped it down to 4 stars because I paid an additional $2.00 for extra egg and it was NOT extra egg. I also called in my order and received a 30 minute wait time. Total wait time was an hour. With all that being said, the ladies won me over with their passion to serve those waiting and making sure each customer was happy!"}
{"input": "We were on our way home from a camping trip and decided to stop in Santa Barbara for some fish taco's last Tuesday! We were trying to find a good place and found out that this was #2 on the list for Baja fish taco's. We were pleasantly surprised at our delicious our taco's turned out to be. We did want to try the shrimp fish taco's and asked if we could get 2 on the side. The kitchen was more than accommodating and gave us a whole platter of delicious battered shrimp. We sat outside on the veranda, enjoying our yummy food and the lovely December weather. The next time we are in Santa Barbara, we will definitely be making a pitstop here again.  The staff is also very friendly."}
{"input": "Sheesh stay far far far away. The prices are ridiculous for completely mediocre food. Wings were gummy, soup luke-warm, and fries cold. It's a chain, but damn that was bad. Do yourself a favor and go down the street to the perky instead. The price and food are way better there."}
{"input": "First time here; I'm a big frozen yogurt fan and was visiting so I stopped in after brunch. It was good aside from the pineapples being a bit tart n mangoes hard. The cashier was very friendly. I sat outside as they provided seats;ate and chatted."}
{"input": "Gator burger top of the line...sleeper spot dont miss."}
{"input": "After a dismal dinner at our former favorite sushi restaurant in Jackson, TN, we decided to get another sushi dinner, this time at Samurai in Nashville, TN.  WOW!  What a difference!  The fish in the rolls were super fresh and the pickled ginger wasn't dyed a day-glo pink!   We had the Dr. Dave roll, the Choo Choo roll, and a roll our waitress recommended that was topped with mango.  All three were delicious!  The Choo Choo roll is topped with strawberries which added an extra dimension to the flavor of the roll I haven't experienced before.  The size of the place is small, be prepared to wait.  We got lucky because it was Fall break at Vanderbilt so we got in right away.  The decor is very low key so don't expect high end service and decked out chic crowds with funky music ala Pod in Philadelphia.  The focus of Samurai is the food, period.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"input": "Really clean super cute cafe. Very friendly & the Caprese sandwich is amazing. So glad I found this gem :)"}
{"input": "Excellent food and excellent service!  My new favorite breakfast place. I loved the biscuits and gravy, extra crispy bacon, sausage links and challah French toast!"}
{"input": "Amazing pizza I think it has won me over from my previous favorite (five points pizza - also veryyy good.) I've taken my boyfriend, parents, and friends here and they have all enjoyed it. If you're looking for a good pizza spot in Nashville this is it!"}
{"input": "We had yummy sandwiches, drinks and shared a huge slice of millionaire cake for lunch.  Although the sandwiches were tasty, neither of us cared for the mustard they used. Also, the \"salad\" that came with the sandwiches was difficult to navigate. Cake was yummy. Very expensive for what we got."}
{"input": "Very attractive space and kind staff but it did not make up for poor food. I ordered a breakfast salad that was supposed to have some roasted potatoes on it. They were cold and rock hard, felt like they'd been frozen and taken straight from the freezer. It was supposed to have 2 poached eggs on the salad, but ended up with only 1 yolk and some extra bits of white. My boyfriend's meal was forgotten and then when he asked about it and they eventually prepared it, what I think was supposed to be a warm sandwich contained cold buffalo chicken that seemed it should've been heated. Sadly won't be returning"}
{"input": "Awesome burgers. I went adventurous and tried the Wiki Wiki, which is wild boar with duck bacon. My wife had the Buckaroo which was a beef patty topped with brisket. Both were very tasty. A little on the smaller side, but great flavors make up for it in spades. Fries and rings were great too."}
{"input": "Buyer Beware!  I visited this store when they were called Vintage 429 in 2003. I bought a signed  Nirvana poster with a COA stating money back if not authentic. We this past week I found out the poster is fake. The COA was signed by the co-owner of Vintage 329. When I called the store this past weekend, they wanted nothing to do with my complaint and were completely unsympathetic. 1200 dollars down the drain. Just because they changed their name, their name is still on my COA. I sent them an email message via their website and have been ignored up to this point."}
{"input": "Lisa and Miles make the perfect dynamic duo! They are both very friendly and professional with the way they conduct business. They are always informed on the latest market trends and offer great advice (especially to first time buyers) like myself :) I would definitely recommend them for all of your real estate needs!"}
{"input": "I usually go to Superior because other people want to...like my brother and his kids.  It's a good place to bring children because it's so loud you don't have to worry about your noisy ones disturbing other folks' meals.  The cocktails are free flowing and the food's OK."}
{"input": "I have straight hair and it turns out best if it's done with scissors . I said I want my hair to be cut with scissors down the side and blended and and she said no clippers and I said now I can go somewhere else and get a scissor cut it's fine no I do a good job was the response I got I can do it with scissors and what are you now she grabbed the clippers and cut 90% of my hair with clippers I get one and ethene clipper cut I told her specifically I get not want my hair cut with clippers I would go somewhere else if I were you to get your haircut unless you want it high and tight whether fade with clippers"}
{"input": "They are closed. Sign is down, place looks cleared out. We tried to have lunch here last week and there was a paper sign on the door, but it's gone now."}
{"input": "Grabber a quick dinner to Kampai : I was pleased with their good quality sushis, I like that you get a soup and a salad included with your order. I wish it was a little bit less pricier and more choices for the hand roll (e.g regular salmon/avocado) Good service as well, I recommend."}
{"input": "After my ROTD  yesterday of a different Sweet CeCe's location, I realized that I had never reviewed my local source!  Anyway, I love the product.  Love love love.  And I usually like their selection of toppings - good mix between healthy and not-so-healthy.  Sometimes the girls working there aren't really paying attention or are nowhere to be found.  Sometimes you have to remind them of their deals (like $5 Friday).  But I can't give it less than 4 stars because I just love it so much."}
{"input": "The food was pretty good and the staff was friendly.  It was a good family friendly place to watch the basketball game on the large screen TVs. The food is kind of slow coming out. It took 45 minutes for a deep dish pizza. But it was made fresh and the waitress did warn us about the cook time. So if you have time, good place to eat."}
{"input": "This bar was created for guys. Great place to hang out with friends. Heard the burger was the best in the city. Tried it out and it was amazing. Make sure you order the duck fat fries too. If you're in Philly this is the place to go to. 5 stars"}
{"input": "I am glad I was able to join friend for their reservations at Luke. The drinks were wonderful! First time having raw and fried oysters, I was told the raw oysters were less salty then regular which I appreciated. I had the crab bisque which was divine, tried my friends shrimp and grits, and the bread pudding, all were glorious and to top it off the serves was great."}
{"input": "Refreshingly delicious compared to crappy chain food pizza!!\n\nI worked at the Hotel duPont... I always thought they should have given us some sort of discount for all the times we ordered from there.  While it's a very good product (don't get a \"chopped\" antipasto salad!), it's a little on the expensive side for pizza."}
{"input": "I went to LA smoke on Thursday afternoon we had to poke rib coleslaw and fries when the rib came out the first time they was Cold send them back they came out hot but they tasted horrible"}
{"input": "Great little place tucked along side the French Market.  GREAT baked oysters!  My wife had the shrimp salad and said it was amazing."}
{"input": "Stopped in for a quick lunch. Jalapeno burger was great.  Sittin' on the patio's pretty cool.  Definitely be back."}
{"input": "I found Roseann's Hair Studio after searching online reviews. They received numerous recommendations and I was looking for a new establishment. I saw that stylist Chuck was rated highly for his expertise. I called and made an appointment with him. \n\nYesterday, I met with Chuck. He was extremely professional and really took the time and patience to understand what I was looking for. I explained to him my usual style and that I wanted a new look. He recommended something I would have never thought of. I love my new haircut and how he transformed my appearance! Chuck is an expert and I would rate him at the top 1%."}
{"input": "Some of the food was cold, they didn't have any of the sides I wanted, there were flies everywhere while eating. I wouldn't recommend dining maybe just take out , wouldn't dine here again...."}
{"input": "I will never rent from hertz anywhere again. I reserved ahead of time through AAA. I did this because I wanted to budget.the sales lady lied to me & said I had to choose 1 of the 3 insurance packages. I told her I budgeted for yay what I was told. She pushed me & said I had no choice. My Bill went up by $97 plus tax. She was cold, pushy & rude. \nI was almost crying & she didn't blink. I have never driven the new Ford Focus & she didn't go over anything. I was just a dollar sign to her"}
{"input": "Johnny thank you for cater the luncheon at the New Castle County Courthouse.I had cops from Phila, New York, Arizona and all of them agree this was the best pizza, chicken finger and hot wings they  had since being in Delaware .I had Officers from Dover and Kent County and  they said it was worth the trip coming up for the food. Johnny everything was excellent ..THANK YOU"}
{"input": "Great selection. Love the clearance prices that are always around. Definitely enjoy the Starbucks inside. A little peeved at the Target Card hawkers....employees who peruse the store asking shoppers if they \"want to save 10%?\" I think I have been asked 50 times(by the same employee), I already have 2 Target Cards thank you very much and I should not have to hide from employees."}
{"input": "Great hiking, biking, running spot. Lots of well maintained paths. Beautiful views and spots with shade which is great when you're hiking in the heat. Only complaint is that people don't follow the dogs on leash rule and I came across at least 6 dogs off leash and away from their owners. Just follow the rules or they will make it a no dog spot!!!!"}
{"input": "You would think from the size of the place it would be good for groups, but in my experience with 9 people on Saturday at 11am it was about a very hungry, tiring wait to get a seat. \n\nWe tried to make reservations, but they do not take them. And I think we were too small to be put in the side meeting room. So hangry we stood, hoping for just the right table to leave.\n\nThe manager was nice enough to offer to fill cups of coffee for us while we waited. But I thought it was odd that they just didn't refill the pot for everyone who was waiting. \n\nNow for the food...They have these 1/2 and 1/2 combos. Which I love! I got a turkey Reuben and salad. I asked for lots of sauerkraut, and they charged $0.50 for it.. Which is no biggie but I'd expect a lot of kraut. Sadly there was not a lot of it.. But it was still a delicious sandwhich.  :) My friend got the sunrise chile rellenos. If I come back with a smaller party, that is what I would get."}
{"input": "An interesting place to visit but, once is enough. Try the West park for better views and more interesting trails, instead. Plus the sunsets in the West park are much better."}
{"input": "Love the atmosphere and surprise salad!  I have eaten here many times after planning to try other restaurants and realizing i'd rather be at Fellinis."}
{"input": "I took my gf for our one year anniversary here,  this cute little hidden  away restaurant was fantastic. Wasn't too uptight, wasn't snobbish, our waiter was very easy going and greeted us by name as we entered. The food was wonderful, and the wine list extensive. Will definitely return\n\nAlso the desert crepes made at the table were fantastic!"}
{"input": "30 min wait. No big deal, wandered magazine and got a Bloody Mary and a beer to go. \nMigas and corned beef hash, with a side of sausage gravy. Everything was good, well seasoned. Nothing blew our minds(Migas were marginal IMO but I'm from the tex mex capital) but it was all good. \nService was efficient."}
{"input": "Literally my favorite restaurant here in New Orleans. My friend told me I need to invest in the restaurant between going there so much and ordering on postmates. I love the atmosphere and the food of course! I order the same thing every time! Pork and shrimp rolls, shakin new york strip with fried rice add egg, and a cobbler to drink! I try looking at the menu to try something new, but my heart knows what it wants. It's never too crowded, and has an overall good vibe."}
{"input": "Stopped by after a Sunday morning walk in the park - great food, coffee customer service - love the vibe in here"}
{"input": "Food was a bit greasy for my taste. The grilled cheese tasted like it was cooked in pure butter. Fries however were better than most. If you dont mind grease this is not a bad place to try but it would not be on my list of restraunts to return to."}
{"input": "Just went here for breakfast.  The food was just OK, the service wasn't particularly great, in fact our server seemed fairly put out anytime we asked for anything.  What really made this a one star experience,  though, was the 6 or 7 year old boy (who was not a customer, possibly our server's son) who was hammering away on the piano the whole time we were there.   We asked our server to ask him to take a break and she was not thrilled but said ok.  She said something to him and he stopped... for about 30 seconds.  Then right back to hammering on the piano keys.   Who wants to pay for breakfast and have to listen to someone hammer away arbitrarily on a piano??? Will never go back."}
{"input": "Delicious!  Great ambiance.  Attentive staff.  Cool history (rumored to be haunted).  Great view of Jackson Square."}
{"input": "One of my favorite places to hang out! I always bring out of state friends and family here and it's always a hit!"}
{"input": "I fell in love with this boutique the second I walked in. There were so many great pieces of clothing to try on. I ended up getting all my skirts and dresses for this warm season. The quality of all my threads has held up thus far. I highly recommend you to at least pop in here if you're strolling around French Quarter!"}
{"input": "Place has ok food but don't choose delivery there. At least if a lady answers. I simply asked for her to read back what I ordered and she became frustrated  she kept saying give me your credit card number.  I told her I would like to know the price and if the order is correct cause they have delivered the wrong order before.  She proceeded to demand for my credit card number after that she said just forget it you don't get no order and hung up.  Like really.  Even though they have messed my order up before like I said there food isn't that bad and they deliver. Only Asian place that will where I live.  but for this to happen they will never get my service again.  They really need to act like professionals or at least get some one else on the phone. I orginally gave this 1 star but thought that wasnt fair cause the food is ok.  Egg rolls  and the pork noodle soup is not bad. Could use a little more flavor but overall not bad. Again Just the service is really bad."}
{"input": "what a wonderful place!!!!!!ive been regular customer of holt's for years,and would never go any where else!!!!this is the first,and best cigar retailer in the east coast,,,and they are the best!!!!!!!amily run,and you feel it with sincere,,caring service,,and their online store is incredible!!!!best sales and offers on a regular basis,,,,,,,,their selection and quality  is exceptional!!!!!!!!10 stars!!!!!-eric"}
{"input": "I've been coming to this place for years now, and even though I now live in Colorado, I come back here every time I'm in Philadelphia for work (which is often). I've tried many items on the menu and many were great, portions are generous, and prices are low. My go to item - Indian Mee Goreng, I can eat that every day of the week if I could, it's that good. Maybe one day I can get the recipe from the manager so I can actually do that on days I'm in CO."}
{"input": "Quick service, yummy food, and a sweet view! You can't beat this place. A total local gem!!"}
{"input": "Stopped here after our first choice had too long of a wait. Nice place; clean and bright. You order at the counter -- oddly, while the specialty pizzas were listed on the menu board, there was no description -- and then sit down to wait. We got a 14\" two topping and two regular drinks, which came about $20. Mind you, this is with paper plates (the chintsy kind, so they brought 4 for the 2 of us) and plastic silverware. The expectation also seemed to be that you bus your own table.\n\nThe pizza sauce was very bland. My husband ordered jalapenos and the guy did honor my request to go easy on them, which I appreciate. \n\nAt noon on a Saturday, it wasn't busy at all. \n\nPet peeve: as a non-soccer fan, I don't mind seeing it on TV, but to have it on both TVs with the volume way up was overkill. Because, shocker, guess what? IT WAS A TIE. :-)"}
{"input": "Our food was delicious and the service was great!! Great ambiance. Sat outside and people watched. Lovely lunch!!"}
{"input": "This place is not bad. Easy check in, comfortable bed, clean room, really nice location & free parking. \n\nMy only issue: noise. I woke up in the middle of night (and I don't go to sleep early) to kids running down the hallway. Not toddlers either...more like pre-teens. Multiple times. Granted, it was Friday night bit still. It sounded like there was no buffer between us to lessen the sound. \n\nI think I would stay here again. We just wanted a cheaper hotel to go visit the zoo and some other sites. This place did the job."}
{"input": "Great service. Awesome ice cream and water ice. Love going there. Staff is very pleasant and helpful with my family. Parking on site and that is great. Keep up the great job :-)"}
{"input": "This is, by far, my favorite bar/grill in Tucson. Everyone is friendly, and the food is always delicious!  I love the margaritas, too! The mac and cheese and crab cakes are my favorite menu items!: If you haven't been here, you are missing out on a Tucson gem!"}
{"input": "Impeccable service, our servers Robert and Wade were excellent. The food was so delicious from the Mr. B's shrimp, garlic chicken to desert. Highly recommend making a visit here."}
{"input": "Love this place! Delicious, inexpensive, and friendly service. The pupusas are soooo yummy and cheap and filling! I love it! I also love their Costa Rican Gallo Pinto. Last time I was there I asked for some avocado and they gave me a whole one that was sliced and *perfectly* ripe and I think they only charged me a dollar. It costs more than that in the grocery store! \n\nOne thing to watch out for is that the food does take a little bit of time to prepare. Not so long that I get impatient, but a tiny bit longer than a standard restaurant. So if you want it on your lunch break, make sure to order in advance and get it to go! :)\n\nThe atmosphere is casual and family friendly. They sometimes have a soccer game or Spanish news channel in the background."}
{"input": "I was so looking forward to a Pho joint in the neighborhood.\n\nno anymore !   \n\nFour neighbors went at different times and all had the same opinion as we did.\n\nI know that they are new , but at this rate, they won't be around much longer."}
{"input": "A cool bar in Tampa, nice crowd, and plenty of drink variety.  It was clean, comfortable and had many TVs around the bar.  Would definitely come back for Happy Hour and or for the big game.  Only negative is that its in Ybor, the decor and theme seems a little out of place for the area."}
{"input": "My wife and I had happy hour here and thoroughly enjoyed it. We got 5 total tapas over a two hour period and were full as we could be. We got the Nashville hot cauliflower (outstanding), roasted duck (outstanding), grilled peaches (outstanding) and the scallops (above average). It got a bit pricey, but these tapas have more substance than a lot of other ones I've had in the past. Wednesday happy hour is half price drinks and $25 bottles of wine."}
{"input": "Redfish Fajitas, Ceviche, Chicken & Shrimp Fajitas  Were all really good. Small Restaurant with tight seating (does have outside seating as well) and not much parking.  Food was all fresh and delicious. Only problem was we had a new waiter who didn't know the ropes yet...so we received our appetizer at the same time as our main course. Well actually actually we never received the Queso dip..because waiter didn't know he was supposed to go fix that himself...yikes! Refill on drinks were slow coming as well.  But overall the fresh well prepared food means we will try it again.:)"}
{"input": "Went here to redeem Groupon, frist time staff member said she couldn't use system and for me to come back after she extended it. I went back and I was told I was out of luck it expired.  Way to waste my time and very un-Yoga like. I will stick with Wake up Yoga and PSC, they know how to treat people."}
{"input": "Delicious sandwiches, great pizzas, decent sides, all made with fresh, flavorful ingredients. Their toasted subs are the best, and the pizza sauce is among the best around. Really, my only complaint is the lack of a whole grain bread. Try the traditional grinder, or the tuna sandwich."}
{"input": "Overall good food and an enjoyable dinner.  One of the few places I've come across that allows you to get fried rice along with lomein in their combo dinners.  Wonton soup and spring roll were just ok, but shrimp lomein, fried rice and general tso's chicken were all tasty."}
{"input": "There are a ton of good sushi places in Reno and I have tried them all, but it always seems like Rickshaw has the freshest fish. I'm not a big fan of rolls and sauces, and opt mainly for Nigiri or sashimi. You can get some dressed up roll anywhere, hell you can buy them in the store, but if you are a true fan of sushi, just fish is where its at and Rickshaw has some of the freshest in town."}
{"input": "Hector was an awesome guide through the sea caves of Santa Cruz Island!!"}
{"input": "I've been wanting to hit this place for quite some time. Today seemed perfect for lunch. I had the classic cheese steak with crab fries. The cheese steak was quite good, tender tasty slices of steak and a warm cheesy sauce on a delicious roll. The crab fries came out hot and crispy and perfectly seasoned. The service was prompt and attentive which I liked. Very clean and a very nice sports atmosphere. I will be back."}
{"input": "Visiting my daughter at nearby college and she wanted some Japanese food. Yelp review brought us here.  My wife and I ordered Chirashi and it looked okay at first but sashimi slices were a bit thin and rice had very little sushi rice flavor.  Problem was the freshness. Fish didn't have any firmness to it and they smell fishy. My son's salmon wasn't fresh either. My daughter's Unagi Don was okay.  Misoshiru was watery and tasteless. If you like cooked items, lots of mayo, teriyaki sauce and lots of avocados, this is your place.   I would give service 3, overall food 2 and sushi or sashimi 1 star for freshness."}
{"input": "The owner contacted me directly to try to right the wrong.  I appreciate the time and effort this took to reach out to a customer."}
{"input": "Took a long time for me to finally come here due to formerly lack luster reviews. I had a great experience at lunch.  Service was kind and attentive; there were only 1-2 other customers. All 3  rolls were delicious. \n\nI will say they were notably smaller than other sushi spots. We noticed right away after sharing 3 rolls that we were not bursting with fullness as usual.\n\nPrices were typical. Specialty roll options not as abundant as competitors. Groupon deal was irresistible. Would have no problem returning but a couple other spots would probably be my first choice."}
{"input": "Place for latest night eats around and drive through is a must. New menu items and some veggie options etc. forgot to put my dessert order in the bag though so I was very bummed when I noticed far too late!"}
{"input": "I really wanted to like this coffee but obviously I didn't.  The location was nice and had a parking lot which is important because parking in the trendiest area of Santa Barbara is a b*&%$.  The vibe was typical coffee shop décor and the service was good.  I just couldn't get over the finish or \"aftertaste\" of the coffee."}
{"input": "Jones. What a relief! Great food and unique lovely drinks. All this combined with knowledgeable staff that appear to enjoy working here. \n\nHad a smashing time."}
{"input": "Went here last Thursday and arrived early enough to take advantage of their $5 domestic pitchers during hh which includes mich golden light, my fave! It did take the server about 10-15 minutes to even notice we were there, but after that service was just fine. \n\nStarted off with the wings which were delicious, although the bf was certain it was not actually a pound of wings which they claim on their menu.\n\nI ordered the gyro and fries which were surprisingly really good! Gyro meat was tasty and the fries were awesome! Bf had the French onion soup and potato skins which he said were good as well.\n\nWe stayed for rock n roll bingo (which I guess is every Thursday, and free!) and we had a blast. They also have a pool table and darts in the back which we played while waiting for bingo to start.\n\nWe will definitely be back!"}
{"input": "Insanely cheap and tasty vegan wings and steaks. Didn't like the pizza though."}
{"input": "Location: near USF's campus so a good opportunity for business \nPrice: Fair for the amount of work that goes into it. \nWait time: 30 mins -1.5 hrs depending on prime time \n\nThere aren't enough tables to accommodate the amount of customers. The ice cream itself is worth the wait. The ice cream is creamy, but has a flaky, icy consistency which goes well with the toppings. \nThe staff are efficient and friendly, but they're usually very focused on making your rolls. \nThe protocol is to order the basic flavor with a fruit mixed in, as well as 3 toppings. \nI would give it a higher rating if only the wait wasn't so long. I've gone twice and both times it was packed. There are people who will disregard the fact that you have been waiting in line to join their friends regardless of the number in their party. Be firm in asserting yourself so that you don't have to add to your wait time."}
{"input": "The customer service at Cafe Deluxe is poor. My party waited a long time to be seated, and then to get our drinks, and then our food, and then at the counter to pay our check. Our server was curt and not polite. \n\nAs for the food, my partner ordered the scramble and said it lacked flavor. However, the cinnamon swirl french toast I ordered was delicious."}
{"input": "I ordered delivery from here 3 times when I wanted sushi, all 3 times the delivery guy instead of knocking or ringing the doorbell just...opened my front door, which scared me to death, another time I waited over 2 hours for my food...and old sushi is not good sushi. Maybe its better to sit and eat at, I only used their delivery service and likely won't be doing so again. But generally speaking they are fine."}
{"input": "I love the recliners. They are very comfortable, however it's a bit gross when you have to clean up other people's trash and tissues before sitting. Before the movie started I saw the employee go in with a dust pan but not sure what he did. The floor was full of popcorn and trash, the cup holders were wet and contained trash, the seats had tissues and napkins stuffed in the seats. The lobby was even dirty as was the bathroom. It was a big trade off for reclining seats."}
{"input": "Great sushi and reasonably priced! Friendly staff is a plus! They recently expanded their menu which has been a lot of fun too!! The VIP card is great for frequent visitors and if someone in your party isn't up for sushi they can order from the Chinese place next door."}
{"input": "I had the smokehouse double and a Oreo cookie shake with peanut butter mixed in and it was fantastic..Lynden was out waitress with lots of energy and a bit spunk..we had such a great time here and you would too."}
{"input": "Had a party of 6 here for hibachi. Our waitress brought our separate sushi orders on one plate so we couldn't really tell who's was who's and forgot several items on an order. I understand making mistakes but the restaraunt was really quiet so we were kind of surprised. Usually hibachi is a fun lively experience and our  cook  said maybe three words, but he cooked very well his name was Francisco. Service was fishy, food was pretty good, and im hoping it was just an off night here. But for the money I wouldn't go back."}
{"input": "What kind of business do these guys run? They don't update their website and they don't tell you where the truck is located. It's a shame because I was craving some Korean food."}
{"input": "We ordered the chilly chicken , chicken lollipop, chicken biryani and paper dosa. The lollipop was awesome and the pieces were really big. The chilly chicken was really spicy cz we had asked for it and the paper masala dosa was fantastic, along with the sambhar and the chutney. The biggest disappointment was the biryani. It was below par. Stay away from the biryani or head nxt door to biryani king. Apart from the the meal was wonderful and i'll cm back again."}
{"input": "My date and I came here for dessert only and were really happy we stopped by. \n\nIt was pretty late on a Saturday but the restaurant was very busy. Being new to the St. Louis area, I didn't know the Cyrano's reputation and was surprised when the waitress so causally asked if we were dining or in for dessert only. Lot's of restaurants balk at the idea of you coming in for only one item, but not Cyranos. \n\nWe order the cherries jubilee and sat back and enjoyed the presentation and dessert . Would come back again to order from the main menu."}
{"input": "Love it here! Their sips mocha is my go-to. Staff has always been so nice! Absolutely love that they have a drive thru too, helps not to unload my kiddos. Oh and their cakes are amazing too!"}
{"input": "I'm not going to be returning to Santa Fe for a while. I just didn't like it, flat out. I've been before for chips and salsa and margaritas, and that was just ok, but I went recently for a full meal and I just cannot get past the fact that the tuna on my yellowtail tostada was cooked hopefully that morning or maybe even the day before, but it was not fresh. It had a congealed coat on the outside of it and it was cold, so I know it came from the fridge. The salad it sat on, iceberg, was so ordinary, it completely downgraded the dish. Haven't they discovered the beauty of baby mixed greens, they are pretty and make every salad seem a lot classier. The best part of the meal were the chips and salsa. Kind of sad really. In my opinion, fresh is always better and when it comes to fish, fresh should be the only option!!!"}
{"input": "Order and drink every craft cocktail one by one. You'll be happy to pull your gelatinous body into the Uber by the time you're done. Our server was a lioness who was born to roar behind the counter. She made my smoked Old Fashioneds the way Beethoven stroked the ivory...fast and fearless. The very next time I land in St Pete I know right where I'm headed, and you should too if you know what's good for you. This place could make a Quaker drink."}
{"input": "Smoking allowed. There, I said it.\n\nGood equipment, lots of room for players, and a nice area for spectators.\n\nBut they allow smoking.\n\nEDIT: Lowering to 1 star after \"Peter F.\" posted his ridiculous claim that spending $22,000 on an air filter makes any difference in protecting his customers from deadly carcinogens...he should do his homework: https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/expert-answers/air-purifier-smoke/faq-20058555"}
{"input": "Always awesome!  Best crust ever and super Fresh ingredients and nice staff.  Lots of yummy toppings that aren't offered at other pizza places.   Great salads too! Patio area is a cool place to kick back,have a beer or glass of wine and savor the best pizza in town."}
{"input": "Great place to get out of the New Orleans heat. Great cold drinks, yummy appetizers and tasty Po'boys!"}
{"input": "I like to enjoy a nice warm beer when I watch a comedian...NOT. The beer is always served with a hot glass. And the appetizers are really bad. I would come here more if the food wasn't so bad...especially since there is usually a two purchase minimum with the tickets we buy. I'd pay more for better food!\n\nMore to come on the comedy..."}
{"input": "You'll definitely have a wait for brunch but grab a drink and buckle in cause it's worth it. Everyone at the table loved what they ordered. We started with the buffalo cauliflower and got the pretzel pancakes, nooner, blueberry waffle and the red velvet waffle and damn if we didn't clean our plates. Also if you don't get the white trash hash you'll regret it for years to come. Service was great and our drinks were perfect."}
{"input": "We visited once and were very disappointed in my veggie pizza and my husband's sub sandwich.  The tomato sauce was not tasty, and they did not use enough cheese on my pizza.  The dough looked and tasted like it was prepared by a machine.  Perhaps they have improved, but we are not in any rush to try a second time."}
{"input": "My group of 6 all got burgers and were very satisfied. Very clean and nice place. Sweet potato tots are a must."}
{"input": "I will start by saying I have a 3 year old and a 10 month old.  We bought a membership so we wouldn't have to stay forever.  As a teacher, I can only visit in school breaks and weekends.  During those times it gets PACKED very quick.  We usually get there when it opens and play for a few hours and go home for lunch.  The food isn't bad, pizza is pretty good.  We love playscape.  It's a great place where both of my kids can play.  If you plan to visit more than once, do a membership."}
{"input": "If you get nothing else on the menu, you must try the bacon wrapped dates.  They are savory with just a touch of sweet and snuggled into a yummy sauce with finely chopped roasted red peppers on the side.  Every bite was gorgeous.  I also had the butternut squash soup, which was very tasty and large enough to be filling on its own.  Then, I also added in some deviled eggs.  They were good, but spicier than I would have thought.  What made them spectacular was the little bit of crispy duck skin on top.  It made the whole dish come together.  We also sent our waitress back no less than 4 times to answer questions about the menu, and she was always happy to check for us."}
{"input": "amazing steaks we always share the steak they're huge! love the sautéed mushrooms"}
{"input": "This place had fantastic donuts! They were very well priced and so soft. We tried the blueberry cake donut and apple fritter. We will definitely be going back."}
{"input": "Love this place with the vibrant colors on a Sunday morning after a night out! We loved the Bloody Mary bar, however they were out of almost everything and they didn't replace. Our waitress was not with it. We have 8 people and it was about a 2 hour trip, 30 min of that was her just trying to figure out the bills, credit cards and payments. It was bad."}
{"input": "I haven't been all around the property yet but what I've seen so far is impressive.  the lobby and casino areas are immaculate. my room, although not my taste in Decor is clean and loaded with great amenities."}
{"input": "2 stars for gumbo, 1 for the blandest, bleakest serving of red beans & rice ever! Really how hard is it to make red beans & why would you serve this NO fare without any seasoning at all? Don't waste time or money on this place"}
{"input": "Do not waste your time ordering take out.  Ive waited over an hour and received the wrong order twice now.  This place stinks!"}
{"input": "I must say, I didn't really have anything to eat. The bf had a little cup of chocolate chip ice cream and said it was good, but really how bad can chocolate chip ice cream be??? \n\n4 stars just because of the huge, old-fashioned, comfy chairs we sat on (and almost fell asleep in) for 30 min. We sat right by the window and got to people watch on a rainy afternoon."}
{"input": "We had a less than mediocre dining experience at Basil Spice last Saturday. We ordered a Thai Iced Coffee that tasted like it had 20 bags of sugar. We got appetizers: satay and spring rolls, which were decent (hence the two star rating). But the dinner was bland and tasteless. We ordered a beef stirfry and two curry chicken dishes (Don't remember the names). The friendly server asked for our spiciness preference. Two of us said spicy and the dishes came out with no spice at all. In addition to the mediocre dishes, the portions were not big enough to justify the price. \n\nThis place is definitely one of the worst Thai restaurants in St. Louis IMO. I am surprised it even got more than two stars from the rest of the reviewers here."}
{"input": "Excellent customer service. I wish I could rent from there more often! Had such a great experience verses other car rental services. \n\nRent if you can!"}
{"input": "Best lamb skewers we've ever had so far! The place is nice and clean, with lots of cute decorations. Everything we ordered was surprisingly yummy and their portion is huge.  Very good service too!  Highly recommend if you wanna try authentic Chinese kabob and northeastern food!"}
{"input": "I used to enjoy this place when it was Steve's now that it is Terraza it is even a little bit better.   Last time I had an omelet and it was quite generous.  This time I had Ham and Eggs!  Everything was cooked exactly as I liked.  The hash browns were crispy and delish!  \n\nI went with a friend who seemed to enjoy it as well.\n\nSome time I will have to try one of their lunch items.  Looking forward to that!"}
{"input": "Not much left to say about this place. Awesome dining experience. Great   Moroccan food, but certainly not the best I've ever had. The experience is really the bread and butter here. Bring cash! Also,   Wish they would mix up the menu a bit."}
{"input": "Great lunch recommended by someone at Nashville airport.  Funky eclectic atmosphere. Great and healthy food choices. Sweet potato casserole with coconut and dried cranberry was fantastic."}
{"input": "We went on a Saturday night and although there were only two of us, the only spots not at the bar were sitting in this six-person area which was still too intimate for others to have joined us.  That said, the staff confirmed we were okay to sit there and even when a larger group showed up, the staff never asked us to move.  In respecting us as the first to arrive, we felt like the only appropriate thing to do in response was have equal respect and once we were finished our cocktails, we asked for the check and headed out.\n\nWhile enjoying our drinks, we got to enjoy the environment of this spot which is free of music, well-lit, and very comfortable furniture which looks like what you'd find at a Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons.  Head here for a truly craft cocktail, great conversation, and staff that appreciates their customers - so in turn, people want to respect them as a way of showing gratitude for their hospitality.\n\nHighly recommended."}
{"input": "Ok I checked lots of reviews on this place , as there was lots of high ratings, and decided to make my way there which is about 30 minutes. I got there, and was disgusted by the appearance of the exterior, then worse interior. I asked to see menu and then walked out. I didn't even want to think what their kitchen looked like in the back.  Shame on Edmonton if they can rate this place a five star. You definitely pay for wht u get"}
{"input": "It is a true Italian market. They have a wide selection of fresh groceries: meats, pasta (yes, fresh pasta), breads, and cheeses. They also have a very large selection of frozen pasta and pre made pasta dishes to take home for a quick dinner. They have a sandwich counter that also has fresh made dishes (lasagna, chicken/eggplant parmigiana, ravioli, manicotti, etc). There's a coffee/espresso bar, bakery, wine cellar and cheese room as well. I haven't had anything there that I haven't LOVED! I like to take advantage of the panini of the day when I can make it in. The time if recommend to go is during the fall. They have pumpkin ravioli and gnocchi, pumpkin cheesecake drink, and a thanksgiving inspired panini."}
{"input": "A very great experience in all aspects.  Service, service, service!  Friendliness of the entire staff with prompt reply to any request.  A delicious and generous buffet breakfast and Wed night the wine and cheese (among other goodies) manager's reception were just the \"icing on the cake.\"   The rooms were big and comfy and the beds extremely nice.  Location is great with a mini shopping plaza attached and a store that sells alcohol just a block or so away.  But if you need transportation - Ask for Eddie Seaton for your cab driver - he's awesome too!"}
{"input": "Painfully slow. Painful parking (but on state street) nails barely lasted for gel compared to other places. The lady that did my nails could care less about me. A place I won't be back to. Sorry."}
{"input": "How nice to find a hidden gem in the restaurant desert of Norristown. I had delicious, well made shrimp and grits with a side of tasty greens. My lovely partner had huge fried shrimp with coleslaw and mac and cheese. The staff was attentive and friendly. We went on a Saturday night and there was a great live jazz trio. We had some difficulty finding the spot.. my only reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars. We will be back for sure!"}
{"input": "Great place with great food & service.  The location was clean and quiet, great for a morning wake up breakfast.  Both the Hyatt and the Fat Rooster staff were very friendly, and the breakfast buffet had a lot of healthy choices.  Organic yogurt, tons of fresh berries & fresh fruit, and made to order omelette served by a very friendly gentleman that greeted us when we stepped up to the omelette bar.  Overall excellent experience and would visit again!"}
{"input": "These ladies are absolutely amazing. They understood completely what we wanted just from our brief meeting and translated it into a fantastic, romantic event. They do everything from tall, dramatic centerpieces, to low, romantic, candlelit flowers. They are so nice, prompt, communicate well through phone and email, and very flexible when it comes to making your dream vision come true! We had so many compliments all night on how beautiful the flowers were from the romantic centerpieces to the natural bouquets."}
{"input": "Thursday night and wonderful life music --- James Taylor style. Food is great and service friendly. Yummy red Sangria too!"}
{"input": "I had the spicy sashimi bowl here and it was absolutely amazing. This restaurant is a Korean owned sushi restaurant and their food is really good. The spicy sashimi bowl is an authentic Korean dish made to perfection. \n\nI discovered this place yesterday and I'm already back today for more! \n\nIgnore all of the bad reviews. This place is good."}
{"input": "Michael who took my phone order and greeted me was very polite and professional! That's hard to find- great customer service! Good job whoever hired him!"}
{"input": "After trying a few ramen places with crazy variety in their selections and stellar broth, I was not too excited about the ramen I got at Cheu.  Maybe it's a matter of taste, but personally, I was not a fan of their thick noodles, and extremely salty broth.  \n\nThe service was great, and they had a nice selection of beers!  The friend I went with loved it, and has been many times.  Honestly, I'm just sorry I wasn't a bigger fan.  But I hope others try it for themselves.  I might just be an oddball out on this one."}
{"input": "Amazing fudge shop, owned by wonderful people! You can taste whatever you want before you make a choice, and the people who work there are really nice and fun!"}
{"input": "Great grocery store in the Mid-city neighborhood. It had great deli, soup, hot bar, and salad bar options. It was like a waaaay less expensive Whole Foods. On the weekends they had crawfish or lobster boils by the lbs. This would be my go to store if I lived here for sure. Big plus it's LOCAL!!!\n\n* Fried Chicken was BOMBlicious!!!!"}
{"input": "Sad!  Last time eating here.  Over priced, over cooked, under staffed!  Salad ok butt charged $2 for extra anchovies (4 total).  No background music in seating area so we could hear everything the cooks and staff did all weekend but they never ask if we needed anything.  The management has now called me a \"sad little man\" in her response.  I'm not sad just disappointed in a chain restaurant that use to be good.  You should be the one apologizing for the bad food.  And yes that young man was nice butt by then my lunch was already ruined by that horrible excuse of a roast pork sandwich."}
{"input": "OMG!!  Saturday mornings have just gotten better.  The 9am classes with Chris are awesome!  Not only are we getting a full body workout with rowing but mixing it up even more with the new specialty classes.  2 weeks ago was the \"Boot Camp\" class where we moved through circuits (using weighted ropes, medicine ball, body weight, rowing, resistance bands) - lots of great music to get you pumped!!!  Then this past week was Abs and Arms!!! And man, am I feeling it.  I can't wait for this coming Saturday!!"}
{"input": "FINALLY SOMEBODY GIVING SWEETIE PIES SOME TYPE OF COMPETITION! \n\nHad the smoked pork steak it was excellent - so tender it was falling to pieces! I also had enough to take home & warm up later. \n\nThe dressing was tasty as well - a difficult feat.\n\nDidn't get to try the banana pudding or shrimp and grits but I'll definitely make my way back!"}
{"input": "Wonderful!  We had the shrimp risotto and fried green tomato stack-amazing!  For entrees, the yellow fin tuna and trout were especially tasty. Dessert of red velvet ice cream cookies knocked it out of the park. Our server, Brock, was delightful."}
{"input": "This round-the-corner clothing version of the fabulous and famous Gravity Pope shoe store is similarly fabulous. The space is amazing and really fits the GP image. It's antiquey and trendy all at the same time, with creaky old wooden floors and and a gorgeous interior. I love how huge this shop is, too. It just keeps going and going!\n\nAnd of course, the clothes here are amazing. I'm a bag girl, and their leather totes, travel bags, and laptop bags are out-of-this world gorgeous. But for $800?  I just can't do it.\n\nI love the items and brands they carry, but I have yet to purchase anything from Gravity Pope, even though I love the store. It's just too darn expensive! Call me when they have a sale."}
{"input": "Fast, efficient service. Tasty coffee. No complaints on my visit. \n\nI wouldn't want to be in the drive thru.... Must have been a line 15 cars long. Hello people! Walk your buns inside!"}
{"input": "Absolutely worst Hertz location!!!! We use hertz for a large company. I will not use it again in St Louis. Carried on luggage, off plane quickly, then waited 25 minutes for a shuttle. I saw all other vendors go by 3-4 times. Ghetto rude workers."}
{"input": "One of the best meals I've had in recent memory--I can't wait to go back!"}
{"input": "I was so excited for this trip. I hadn't taken a vacation in years. I booked the king size bed with whirlpool tub for some romantic relaxation with my boyfriend. We were visiting Tahoe but decided to stay here specifically for that room. \n\nWe check in, all is well and we get to our room and it's a basic two queen room. We go back to the front desk and explain that this isn't the room I paid for. The front desk explains, \"Yeah,  there was an emergency and now the rooms are unavailable, so I took off ten dollars.\" \n\nI was livid. They took my card without first informing me that my room had been changed. I would not have spent the extra gas to stay in RENO, if it meant staying in a generic room I could have booked anywhere. I felt very cheated. \n\nThe fact that they ran out of fruit every morning at breakfast was beyond frustrating. \n\nWe plan on visiting Tahoe again soon but we won't be staying here or Marriott ever again."}
{"input": "Food and atmosphere is nice. As one should expect in the CBD. Sometimes the back room can be stuffy on a busy day. I recommend the raw oysters and burgers. A few dollars on the high side for lunch."}
{"input": "Came to visit my daughter and we had dinner tonight.  I had been here before but my husband had not. We were looking at reviews and someone mentioned they loved their Bucatini Ronaldo so I decided to give it a try.  Waiter stated that the pasta for this dish is homemade (like tubed noodles) with shrimp, artichokes and roasted eggplant in a red sauce. While everything was delicious, I thought this dish was fantastic as it was unusual. It had all my favorite ingredients.  Our waiter Kubec was very attentive and service was great.  Overall......5 star worthy!  In fact my daughter is going back next weekend with 6 friends!"}
{"input": "I would give them 6 stars if I could. We had a fantastic time at this restaurant. We used the Yelp \"Skip the Line\" option which out us ahead of a lot of other people who probably did a walk-in. We we're seated less than 15 minutes after our Yelp suggested arrival time. Our server Joe was the sweetest gentleman. We ordered Bloody Mary, Mimosa and a Bailey's Irish coffee for drinks. All amazing! The Bloody Mary basically came with an appetizer on top. Hah! We ordered the Breakfast Sandwich and Baked Breakfast Sandwich for our meals. The portions we're huge but so delicious! The hashbrowns we're better than the ones at WaHo and if you know me, you know my love for WaHo hashbrowns! The grits we're way better than Flying Biscuit's grits and that's saying something! Overall, amazing place for brunch and fantastic service!"}
{"input": "Save your money!! The food taste like cheap buffet food....very bland!! Even the mac and cheese was terrible. Only think we enjoyed was the live music."}
{"input": "Right around the corner from our house - this is our (my husband and I) go to for everything! Brunch, a cocktail, a late night snack, a date night! \n\nWe love pub and kitchen so much - such a cool vibe and such great people, the food is the best too :)\n\nLove it!"}
{"input": "Came here for the first time today. I'd been to Delicia and didn't even notice it before! My friend recommended it and I'm always down to try a new taco spot. I walked in and immediately loved the energy and design of the place. The crushed green velvet-backed booths popped out in front of the industrialized looking wall, I loved that contrast. Our server was very sweet and attentive. My friend and I ordered two orders of guacamole it was so yummy. She got the fish tacos and I got the shrimp, both were super tasty. The aioli on the shrimp tacos was the best part. We each got the sweet potato wedges as our side and I was overall very pleased! Great casual, tasty and clean food. Can't wait to try their margaritas next time!"}
{"input": "I don't even know what to say. This place is an experience as well as a great place to find books. Like something out of a movie, just stacks and stacks and shelves of books that haven't seen the light of day in decades. Explore here."}
{"input": "This is my favorite Mexican restaurant outside of California at the moment but I dare say they are giving those places a run for their money. I got stuck on the torta and get it every time I go because it's so freaking delicious. The salsa is killer, the owners are amazing, oh and the Jamaica (hibiscus tea) is the best I've had.\n\nEverybody should eat here."}
{"input": "Great place for happy hour. Oysters were deLISH! My friend and I had 2 dozen and we had some cocktails! The riverbend and champagne au poir we quite tasty. I had a side of fries and she had a side a grits. Best grits I've eaten. Definitely coming back. The server was great too. Just the right amount of attention!"}
{"input": "Love the food! Been bringing the Fam here for years. Recently, the service has gotten very slow compared to years past & some of the servers have a sulky attitude...Sad. Good news is their other location is just do n the road."}
{"input": "I am not an indian food type of person but this place lives up to the hype. When you go, just let Hassan make something for you, don't try and overwhelm yourself with the different options. Make sure to get a chaat and a lassi as the two really complement one another."}
{"input": "Great experience. Been wanting to try it. Mardi Gras made it complicated. Glad I waited. Mike did a great job. Nothing like a fresh cut. Place is really cool. Like stepping back in time. Do recommend and will return."}
{"input": "Food, was great had BBQ nacho as an appetizer, great beer selection and great value for the price. Only bad experience was our waitress rushed us to get our order with 15 mins we had our food which being on a biz meeting made it where we had our food before our beer...."}
{"input": "I love going to this place especially the Lush stores and Victoria secret :)"}
{"input": "I don't always go to Prohibition Taproom, but when I do:\n1 - I will probably just have a Yards Brawler, b/c I'm not a huge beer drinker and I know I like Brawler\n2 - I might try another British style beer\n3 - I will ALWAYS order the beer battered green beans, b/c they are light, refreshing, and I don't feel like I'm being too unhealthy\n4 - I will complain about the loudness; the small room acoustics are seriously out of control once it starts to fill up (and it is almost always full).\n\nHonestly, we would probably go here more but it's just a bit out of our way as far as local places.  But when we're going to the Troc or seeing a show at Arts Underground then we always make Prohibition a stop.  Nice, accommodating staff, nice, clean decor and nice food. Dig it!"}
{"input": "To the food, the service and the beer this place is great! Very impressed with their whole selection. I got the crab cake and it was so good!! I like all the selections you can get beer wise and it's close! The only thing I can say is a little iffy is the parking however that is not their fault as hatboro is a busy place with minimal parking all around."}
{"input": "Sat at the outdoor bar, by far my favorite place at st. Pete. Live music, cool air blowing from the cielling fans, friendly bartender, and oh so delicious food! Our bartender recommended the Tuna topped oysters (sorry can't remember the name) and I had the lobster ravioli, yum!! Great atmosphere! Loved everything!"}
{"input": "LOVE Mi Ranchito! We come here often for lunch.\nThe restaurant is huge, but it does fill up! Recommend arriving by 11:30 on a weekday to not have a wait. If you do have a wait, it won't be long--they turn tables quickly.\n\nEverything I've tried here is great. Some favorites are the fajita nachos, chimichangas, and Lunch Vippy's Special (A chicken burrito topped with queso, and rice on the side). \nThe best part about Mi Ranchito in my opinion... always consistent! Food is always delicious, and hot! The service is quick as well. All of the staff are friendly."}
{"input": "Tried dinner there recently and found the quality is very uneven.\n\nWhile some noodle soup dishes and rice plate dishes are true to authentic Chinese food, others are truly found in only American Chinese restaurants. The duck is very fat and very little meat. The stir fry dishes have weird combo of vegetables that do not go together.\n\nAnd as a typical Chinese restaurant, service does not come with a smile."}
{"input": "Super cute local coffee joint, very good coffee. I got a speedball which was 2 espresso shots in a cup of coffee. My friend I was with got a nitro coffee which was also very good."}
{"input": "Great food!  Texture of everything is melt-in-your-mouth.  The sauces are amazing.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"input": "I've been going to Rev regularly since it opened, and it just keeps getting better. They'd added new items to the food menu, and there's now a full list of classic & more exotic tiki drinks in the tiki bar out back. I've been to quite a few tiki bars across the country (it's a hobby), and I can honestly say Rev is still one of my favorites. Classic, kitchy decor, great music, super chill, and the drinks are on point. They have hundreds of tequilas if you're not into mixed drinks and the food is reliably delicious. I usually go for the potato or pork tacos. Try the dirty deeds hot sauce."}
{"input": "I've been here over 20 times. I've been pleased each time. The hot stone massage with the pedicure is heavenly. Every nail tech has been friendly and the results have been uniformly good. The staff is primarily Chinese. Sometimes the nail tech will translate what is going on out of the blue. It is a nice gesture.\n\nIt's very clean. They use sanitized tool packs for each manicure or pedicure.\n\nThey offer water and a dish of candies. The waiting area is small but the leather couches are comfy. They have 2 nice size mounted TVs with closed captioning on the one. One time I requested a particular program and they were more than happy to put it on. The price is right.  The owners are courteous. You don't need an appt but I try to call ahead since it gets busy in there. \n\nThe only downside is that it's in downtown Media on State St so parking can sometimes be a p.i.t.a.\n\n."}
{"input": "Let me say right off, I'm not a bbq fan and by that I mean pork bbq. So what did I order, the chicken sandwich, of course. The buns looked yummy but I passed on them and ate the chicken and slaw from the sandwich with what I guess was their white bbq sauce (looked light orange). The chicken was on the rare side and the slaw was meh. I ordred the grit casserole and green beans for my sides. The green beans were fresh and the grits were yummy. My friends ordered the special of the day - rib sandwich and they raved about it along with the baked beans and chilled bean salad. The atmosphere is good and I loved the deck for outdoor dining. They had a great selection of sides and I'd be happy just eating them next time. I'd give it another try even though I wasn't wowed."}
{"input": "I wasn't to pleased with Fatty's, our server was rude and open about his dissatisfaction with us asking him things about menu drinks etc. Beer prices are higher than most. Food was okay."}
{"input": "Great lunch!!  We saw all the people eating here so we decided it must be a good place to go!! The food was amazing !! We took other's advice and tried it all!! Mac and cheese was great so was the banana pudding.  I had the Chilean sandwich and would skip the bun and the slaw next time. The French fries were amazing !!"}
{"input": "Have been using Kings for about 5 years for my business travel. Making a reservation is quick and easy. Drivers are prompt and friendly. Would highly recommend Kings for their reliable service."}
{"input": "Fantastic service food was great such a nice Irish Pub. We felt like we were visiting Ireland all over again."}
{"input": "The Optical center at the Springfield location is a total ripoff and a con IMO. as soon as the clerk found out I had $450 on insurance to spend he went to work with his little calculator for 20 min while I sat there, giving me no options or telling me what the hell he was doing. Then when the bill was wY beyond that he was cryptic about the charges then finally admitted he used items from FIVE years ago to come up with a price for my glasses! Then had the nerve to try and sell me sunglasses for $250. A total hustle and when I confronted him he didn't even en defend himself. Go somewhere else. I am as I felt totally ripped off on behalf of my insurance company."}
{"input": "I have only been to Second City in Chicago so I have to compare this to that.  I liked Second City better because it was funnier and had a better vibe.  I did enjoy myself at the N Crowd and so did the people I went with.  One of us even got pulled on stage.  I thought some scenes were not funny but that's how improv goes, you win some, you lose some.  But overall, I thought they did a great job and you can tell they really enjoyed what they were doing."}
{"input": "My car was filthy on the outside. There was still bird crap and bugs on my car. They also forgot to spray my fragrance that I paid for. The manager had to come and wipe my car over again and spray. Even after that I still wasn't satisfied it was just an overall bad job. I gave them 2 stars because my interior was clean."}
{"input": "Had a truly awesome experience at North Penn Mazda today. Our daughter purchased her very first car, a 2016 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring. Joe and the team at Mazda worked tirelessly to get her the car she wanted and an awesome price. From the time we walked in until the time we left, they made us feel like we were the only ones in the dealership. There's not enough words to describe our first experience with this dealership! Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"input": "I got the gyro \"platter\" for lunch, which was dry, uninspired, and nothing like a deconstructed gyro. Worst of all, it came with \"vegetables\" which looked more like poop. Tasted that way, too. There are better places in Fairmount for lunch, and they won't serve you poop, either."}
{"input": "Visited Richard's for brunch Saturday 2/18. Good service, but shockingly first bad meal we have had there, and we were long time frequent Cafe Vicino patrons before their move and rebranding. Potatoes that came with my eggs and bacon, and my wife's eggs and sausage we're OVERsalted to the point of being inedible. Toast was cold upon delivery. Hope this was a one-off."}
{"input": "So I finally have a chance to try this place out after reading many many positive reviews on Yelp and on Facebook. For a Tuesday morning, we waited about 20-30 minutes (No line at 12 pm). There were 3 of us and we all were so excited since it's our first time here. I ordered the Sweet Potato Pancakes with a side of hash brown. One of my friends ordered the Rash Berry Pancakes , which he complained was way too sweet. The other ordered Pig in the Blanket (pancake wrapped around a sausage), which she ended up eating the sausages only. The pancakes were very average and plain, definitely not as good as what people said it to be. Hash-browns were average also. Personally, I prefer hash-browns at Bongo Java. The portions are huge and I recommend sharing it with someone. \n\nFor that amount of waiting time and mediocre food, I wouldn't come back unless I'm around the area. Not worth waiting at all.\n\n2013/#42"}
{"input": "The Paris Hair Salon is a warm, friendly inviting personal experience with people who really know hair. I have thick unruly hair and many don't take the time to carefully go through it. Paris Hair takes the time and makes it right, I am so pleased, and the price is right too. Cut, color and hilites all perfect, every time! -Maureen Kerfoot"}
{"input": "The food is always amazing here! That's really all I have to say. Creative, delicious sandwiches, wonderful fries. Nice service. Do visit, prepare to wait, but it's worth it."}
{"input": "My absolute favorite sushi spot! Their specialty rolls are amazing! Try the Superstar roll and Mexican roll."}
{"input": "For a airport hotel restaurant it was pre darned good! The hubs ordered Shepard's Pie and LOVED it! He enjoyed that it was beef brisket and not hamburger, so much more authentic that way. He was very pleased.\nI had the BALT (Bacon, Avocado, Lettuce, Tomato), it was SO good. Loads of bacon! I highly suggest it.\nI had a draft beer. I don't know what it is about this state but I swear we can't get a properly cooled and poured draft. Zero head and it was def not quite cold enough.\nNonetheless, I'd suggest it's a terrific stop!"}
{"input": "This place is such an unheralded gem. When I want brunch, I usually go one end of the spectrum or the other. I either want crab eggs Benedict and a mimosa or I want greasy bacon and hashbrowns.  3 sisters sits at about 75% toward the former on that continuum. \n\nI got the ham sandwich that was featured on DD&D.  An amazing sandwich. Kind of like a southern Cuban sandwich.  I know it's not breakfast food but it was nearly noon and that sandwich is hard to deny. \n\nMy wife got an omelette that was just perfect.  Pick up to five add-ins which is a nice format compared to most places that nickel and dime you for each personalization. \n\nI had hoped to save room for the bacon chocolate pie but it just wasn't in the cards. \n\nThe ambiance is very homey and quaint.  Big fan of this place."}
{"input": "I've eaten here and gotten food via the drive-thru many times, and the food has always been fine. It's standard McDonald's food, so I won't other with a description. I happen to love their fries and like their cheeseburgers and a couple of the breakfast sandwiches. \n\nService has varied from so-so to good---but usually toward the \"good\" end of the scale---and the speed has been from slow to super-fast. My one problem with this McDonald's location is not getting straws or not getting napkins when the drive-thru is busy and the workers are rushing; so do check your bag(s) after you leave the window. (I actually preemptively carry a spare straw in my glove compartment because of how many times this has happened.)\n\nThey have free Wi-Fi, if that's useful to know."}
{"input": "A ++++.  Wonderful service from Jeremy and AWESOME food.  Salads were great, steaks were cooked perfect, and the service was wonderful."}
{"input": "I almost don't want to rate this restaurant 5 star....only because I'm selfish and want to keep this place under the radar.  I've not had one thing on the menu that wasn't delicious, and I've eaten here at least 6-8 times in the last 3 weeks.   Steaks are delicious, and if you like pasta, Try the Tuscan Gravy w homemade fettuccine.\nIf you've had breakfast at their beach location, you find some of the same items, but some prepared differently from the beach spot. \nI had the sausage gravy and biscuit, it was probably the best I have ever eaten. My companion ordered the lox eggs Benedict and loved them.\n\nHappy hour 2-6 everyday with drink and app specials. I love the Thai Chicken Flatbread  There is Outdoor seating, and two indoor dining areas. Great ambiance and the service is quite good as well. The drinks are generous and delicious. \nParking can be a bit tricky, nut go around the corner and there's parking behind and a back entrance. Enjoy, and I might see you there!"}
{"input": "Flat out amazing seafood. Everything was fresh pulled from the tanks in front of us. Small place but great food. Anybody visiting Santa Barbara should park in the pier and eat at this place. Ask your server for recommendations and try the local beer.\n\nHint: park in the pier and use free valet if no spaces"}
{"input": "Love love love love this place!  Very entertaining hibachi chefs and unique sushi rolls. I also use them for catering a lot. Perfect for lunch, date night or GNO!"}
{"input": "I must admit, I wasn't expecting much. This place totally blew us away. This has to be one of the best Indian restaurants in the Tampa Bay. The ambience is wonderful including white table linens. The best part was the food, OMG. The chicken 65 was to die for, and the hot sour soup was rich and flavorful. The waitress (Angel) was friendly,  attentive and very pleasant. They opened just a week ago. I'm sure this will soon be the place foodies seek out for real Indian food."}
{"input": "If you want great customer service and friendly faces I highly recommend visiting Trend Eye Care! The staff were very helpful and answered all of my questions regarding eyeglasses! Especially Mary! \n\nFrom taking an eye exam to picking out a pair of glasses, Mary was able to walk me through all of the options that were available to me. She did a great help helping me pick out frames that fit my budget and made sure I took advantage of the benefits that my insurance provided.There are so many brand name frames to choose from, it can be intimidating. But she was able to help me finally select a pair from our friendly conversations. In less than a week, my glasses were ready for pickup! Not only are the staff great, the place is well lit, cleaned, and in an area I always visit. From now on I will go to Trend Eye Care for all of my eye needs!"}
{"input": "This place is nothing short of astounding.  I went in for my first Brazilian and decided to get a blow-out as well.  These women are incredible in every way, from their work to their personalities. I've never felt more comfortable and relaxed under such intimidating circumstances (THANKS JENNE!).  Oh, and they're both comedians, so be ready to laugh the whole time you're here :)  Can not wait to go back!"}
{"input": "Homemade. Quaint. But the one thing that you must get are THE GRITS! Wow! Best grits I have ever had in my life. So yummy we ordered another bowl. If you have a phobia to cows like you may clowns, take it to go! Serious COW fest going on in here. Enjoy!"}
{"input": "Went for breakfast on a Sunday morning. We were the first or second table in that morning. Small place with the chef/owner and his kitchen located front and center of the dining room. I ordered the Eggs Benedict with house made Canadian bacon. The bacon was good, but it was the perfectly poached eggs and delicious, lightly lemony Hollandaise sauce that made the dish. It was sublime. My GF had eggs,bacon, and home fries which she was quite happy with. The server was quite good, too. I'll be back!"}
{"input": "My wife purchased a 90 min massage from Groupon as I was having major shoulder pain. This was the first time ever having a professional massage and I was happy to get this done here at Liferoot. Nate was able to relieve the pain in my shoulder and I am now back to my regular workout routine."}
{"input": "I've been to dmitris a few times and their food has never disappointed. It is authentic and fish is always fresh. Their food is hands down five stars. I am giving them four stars only because they require you to place your appetizers and main dishes at the same time but do not always allow for adequate time between courses. I don't mind placing orders for both at the same time, but they should definitely plan out the timing a little better. Other than than, dmitris is a great byob in queen village."}
{"input": "We enjoyed both a great breakfast and a great lunch here recently. Our servers were friendly, sweet and on their A-game. The very small kitchen has a little trouble keeping up with the demand of the closely-packed tables. Highest praise for the fried green tomatoes and the avocado bowl. The Caesar salad had freshly grilled chicken and thick shavings of parmesan. The oyster po boy was full of outstanding oysters and served on really good bread. There were a couple of disappointments: the coffee tasted as if it had been stewing too long and the pancakes weren't warm when they hit the table, but they were still tasty. Will definitely return."}
{"input": "Great new spot for us locals to get off of Beach Drive!  Creative menu and and fresh makeover looks hip and fresh.  I had short ribs and truffle fries, I could be mistaken but I believe I had some duck as well, not bad for a girl who doesn't like meat. I couldn't get enough:)\nThumbs up to them, the bar is small but you can sit indoors or outdoors"}
{"input": "Texas Roadhouse does not give you the steak you ask for in the case. I have been here multiple times, asked for a specific steak, and have a steak come out for my meal that is a completely different steak. This is such a hoax, tourist attraction as part of the restaurants, and really dishonest. This restaurant shouldn't offer this if they cannot actually provide their customers with what they ask for."}
{"input": "I don't make it out this way often but when I do, I always say how I could spend an entire afternoon running errands here. From World Market to Target or Marshall's and Dick's Sporting Goods, there are big box retailers that I may hit up a couple of times a year. You're shocked right? How do I not hit up Tar-jay on the reg? Easily. Trust me. \nThis shopping center always offers up ample parking and is organized and tidy... if I was going to step out on my local retailers, this would be a destination for me."}
{"input": "I had acquired a watch when my Grandfather passed and dropped in to get the battery replaced. They noticed one of the pins was missing and went ahead and fixed it on site for free. The wait was a bit for a battery change, but I can't complain because they were extremely nice and didn't charge me for the battery all while fixing the pin. I would definitely look there if I was in the market for some bling."}
{"input": "First visit.  Food was generally good.  One of the few places where I can get Eggs Benedict,but the Hollandaise was a little vinegary.  The soup special tasted like Chef Boy-ar-dee mini ravioli watered down with tomato  juice.  Other food served to our party was generally good and enjoyable.\n\nThe service was acceptable, but much less than awesome.  Waitress refused to even check on the possibility of upcharging for a BOWL of soup rather than a cup with the 1/2 sandwich, and instead just claimed \"we can't do that\".  She also claimed she \"didn't know\" about some of the ingredients in one of the dishes, and made no effort to check with the kitchen to find out.\n\nIt's a 'pay as you leave\" place, and the cash register is right next to the main entrance.  Things could get a little tight during a rush, and we had some problem checking out when a family with small, somewhat unruly children arrived at the same time.  Maybe they should insist that the waitress take the check?\n\nOverall: 8 out of 10\n."}
{"input": "I was in the area today and decided to get my gyro fix. For two gyros it was just under 19 bucks. My wife and I were less than impressed. The gyros were noticeably smaller and less tasty than before. For 19 bucks, I'll look for a new gyro place."}
{"input": "We have been going here for three years now on a weekly basis and it is consistently good every time!  Tried almost everything on the menu and haven't had anything bad yet.\n\nPatron margaritas are the best!  Chips and salsa are never ending!  Never too crowded and always seated quickly.  Friendly staff remembers us  ;)\n\nUpdate:  place is going downhill now. :(."}
{"input": "I love everything about this place. Great vibes and great bartenders. What more can you ask for? I would recommend spinning the wheel to choose what drink you get. Each spin/drink cost $10 but there are 3 chances to get a free shots or a free drink. Seems like a better deal unless you land on smirnoff ice. \n\nWe tried all 3 gummy bears and my favorite was the mai tai. The drinks here aren't too overly sweet which I was afraid of. \n\nFYI - this place is above felipes. You will have to go through the staircase in the back to find this hidden gem."}
{"input": "Incredible service and incredible food! The black bean ravioli is succulent! The bone-in steak was flavorful and amazingly juicy and delicious. And the best of all, service was perfect. From the friendly hostess to the waiter to the chef who personally came over to make sure we enjoyed our food, everyone really made us feel at home. \n\nAs an added bonus, the ambiance is beautiful. Decor, lighting, and fireplace makes the place very homely. \n\nHighly recommended. I went as a group of four and had an excellent time."}
{"input": "Truly, the Skyway Cafe is one of those perfect Brunch spots. The service is excellent, the coffee is brewed well and is refilled often, and the atmosphere is saturated with a regular, local crowd with a loyal following. Get in before 11 because it gets crowded!"}
{"input": "I love tazikis. It may not be authentic Greek food but it's a healthier option when you're eating out. I love the gyros and the Greek salad. They also have a kids menu, which my kids aren't big fans of but. they are very very picky. \nEvery time I eat here I think I could live on Mediterranean diet."}
{"input": "This place is right around the corner and I'm sooo glad that it is!! Delicious barbecue that's decently priced!! Will return!!"}
{"input": "I love their mobile grooming service. Elizabeth brings the grooming bus and all four of our dogs are groomed the same morning."}
{"input": "Good place to take the children. The rangers really try to incorporate your children into the tour of the house. Take time to see the film at the visitor center. The museum is also worth the time."}
{"input": "The highest quality of cold or hot subs and Italian paninis in St Petersburg.  The bread for the sub is made onsite, high quality meats, veggies, and their own yummy coleslaw red pepper condiment.  The subs are only $5.00  Eating a sub without Mayo or mustard is really refreshing.  Eat one here (BTW, I really doubt you will be able to eat the whole thing in one sitting), and you will never go to Subway again unless someone else pays.  You will be surprised about the weight of the sub that is packed with yummy things.\n\nIf not having lunch, there is a bakery with all of the goodies, inexpensive coffee bar, cheese and wine room, fresh pasta, deli, olives, etc.  It's a St Pete landmark for a reason.   \n\nVisit on a non-Saturday, if you like elbow room."}
{"input": "An absolute gem. We were determined to hit a Diners, Drive-ins and Dives restaurant in New Orleans, and boy did we pick the right place. Excellent food, fun atmosphere and an overall great experience. I had the kalamata muffuletta and it was insanely good. A little bit out of the way and totally unassuming from the outside, but don't let that deter you. Highly recommend."}
{"input": "I think if I could, I would give Zen Yai a 3.5 stars, but alas, c'est la vie. \n\nThe prices for their curry are excellent, at less than $12. Zen Yai is a tiny place, which is both good and bad. Good if you don't have to wait, because it is nice and cozy, but bad if enough people eat here on a given evening -- because you may just have to wait a while.\n\nI like the decor a lot, and the use of colors. The tables and plates are full of refreshingly bright colors. \n\nThe service was fine, and the food was at our table in no time.\n\nMy Pineapple curry was excellent! And the rice is served in the shape of a pyramid, which is fun. \n\nAll that being said, my girlfriend had a less than pleasurable experience. She is a seasoned green curry lover, and was disappointed with their green curry offering."}
{"input": "Great store. Insane selection. Incredible customer service.\n\nWish they could come to Ft. McMurray. \n\n:("}
{"input": "Even with historical credibility that may be dubious, this was a neat stop on the river road.  There's not a lot to do here, no hiking trails or anything of that nature that I could see.  But it was still pretty cool to stop and stretch one's legs during a long drive."}
{"input": "A nice neighborhood feel, but it isn't the first place to pop into mind when asked for recommendations. The interior and service are nice, but the food and drinks are pricey for what is served, unless you go for their outdoor summer happy hour!"}
{"input": "We were strolling the French Quarter looking at Yelp and trying to decide where to eat. The hostess was at the open door welcoming passers by, I was hesitant but then took a look at the menu and decided it was worth a try. The decor looked updated, new and clean. There's a cool shaped tile along the bar and floor.  We learned it is a new restaurant. The picture of the deviled eggs on Yelp caught my attention but I ordered the chicken sandwich. It had yummy crunchy chicken and cole slaw in it, plus grilled sourdough that made it just right for me. The blasted Brussel sprouts - among the best I've ever had with fiery jelly, a great taste on it. I choose the grits because I wanted a real NOLA meal. There was corn in them and I think it made them tastier. My husband was happy with his NOLA pasta. We had a nice meal thanks to Yelp and the hostess. I hope they stick around so I can go back for the deviled eggs."}
{"input": "Waited 1 hour for a simple salad.\nThis place takes forever to bring out your food!\nThe service is slow and horrible.  I had to ask for my salad to go since I had a plane to catch.  When I was able to finally eat my salad, they forgot to put a side of salad dressing, needless to say my salad was awful!  There are plenty of other restaurants you can go to, don't waste your precious time and hard earned money on this dump!"}
{"input": "Was visiting NoLa and happy I came to Luke everything was awesome!!! Great seafood, definitely a must when in NoLa"}
{"input": "Awesome place. Great beer selection, music and friendly service. Check it out!"}
{"input": "Mummy's Day off was a great service! I called and spoke to a gentlemen and then ultimately to Angela. Memorial Day Weekend, we had 2 energetic 8 year olds, and a house with a big yard and pool.We were on a wine tour so this was an 8 hour sitting job. She arranged for a sitter that was perfect for the kids. Johanna. She swam with them and played games. The first thing my son said was \"best sitter ever\". He doesn't really get left with a sitter often so he was a little apprehensive, she made him feel at home and they had a great time. Johanna also watched our dog! Angela finds you the perfect sitter to meet all of your needs! \n\nGreat service, great result!"}
{"input": "A 12 dollar burger and fries that were not even edible. Seriously, I used to enjoy this place but man has the quality taken a nose dive."}
{"input": "Had not been for years.\n\nWe went for lunch. Great decor. Great wait staff. Personable and on the ball.\n\nMy bud had the fish special, serving was a bit small but delish he said.\n\nI had the fattoush salad with chicken. Spicing was everything it should be. The chicken was good, just that. The lettuce was limp and so was the pita. Not an olive in sight.\n\nPricey, especially for lunch. We will not be rushing back."}
{"input": "Ugh! I was so excited to get the new move-in packet with a $10 off deal here! (Although I'm not new to the area) I wanted to opt for the gluten free but that apparently was not part of the deal. So I chose Hawaiian and my boy chose BLT. We did half and half on a large pizza, The Hawaiian was o-k. I wasn't wowed. I didn't even try the BLT which just looked awful to me with an overload of balsamic glaze. (Please see pic) The bread sticks were decent. Just seemed like the pizza crust with cheese. Overall my experience was o-k or decent. I will be back to try the gluten free as I am trying TRYING! to not eat wheat!"}
{"input": "A little too \"pretty\", and not an outdoor range are my only negatives.\n\nHuge selection, helpful staff, decent prices, training classes, full auto rental guns.\n\nUpdated 2018 : They made it even better. Moved the rental guns to an easy to see case away from the cashier, decreasing clutter and wait time. Definitely the best range/shop I've ever been to."}
{"input": "Friendly bar tenders, great selection of beers on tap and a great chill place to hang for the night."}
{"input": "We went here because we found a Groupon and because of the owners, who star on It's Always Sunny. It was pretty loud and my food was lackluster. It tries to be upscale tavern food, but that type of food nearly always fails. They are strict about no substitutions which is annoying. They did have a good beer selection with some I've never heard of which is always good. I'm not sure I'd go here for the food, though the Groupon made it better. Also kind of slow service and kind of cramped since the bar crowd stated filling up the restaurant area. I would go for the beer selection."}
{"input": "Was looking for some good Thai food and took a chance.  The reviews on yelp were good and I think the food was great!  Had the rolls as an appetizer and they were so yummy!  Very friendly owners and staff.  Also had the Pad Thai Chicken and could not eat it all.  Very generous portions, just wish I had a way to take the left overs with me but no microwave at the hotel!  Splurged and also enjoyed an iced Thai tea and the coconut custard."}
{"input": "Great food. The owner was so nice.  Lacks a bit on atmosphere but makes up for it with the food.  Will return for sure the next time I'm in the area."}
{"input": "Average food with a really good location. I went for breakfast once and lunch another time. Breakfast was average, same with lunch, which was a choice because the first two places we picked were closed for lunch hours. For the lunch visit, we split a patty melt and a corned beef sandwich. The menu made it sound like the corned beef was a hot open faced sandwich, but it was nothing more than cold lunchmeat and dressing. Everything was bland and under seasoned. Wait staff hung out by the counter a lot to talk, but seemed friendly when they approached our table. Food wasn't 'bad', but the only reason I'd really go back is because of the location and if I was in a hurry, no other reason to really go back, and I live in the immediate area."}
{"input": "Amazing service! The bartender up front was phenomenal. She was very knowledgeable about wine and made our experience very fun. We drank wine and had a few appetizers; the meat & cheese tray and prosciutto. Good stuff, we'll be back!"}
{"input": "Service is great.\n\nThe food however... its a complete hit or miss. Don't order the fish and chips you get a half pound of fish and a pound of batter!!\n like learn how to batter fish. It is pretty simple. Thanks for reading my rant be cautious of what you order...."}
{"input": "Had a lovely experience last weekend at Coco Blue! Really appreciated Michelle's attention to detail. My nails look amazing! Will definitely be back! They still look perfect five days later, which I greatly appreciate :)"}
{"input": "Dirty bathrooms and very slow service, but I was pleased because they had a TV on with subtitles and the volume on, and it was turned to the news!  A good place to pass some time with a tasty Mc-snack and a hot coffee while in Philly during a chilly day!  We stopped here on the way to a football game and found it a very pleasant and relaxing place to hang out for a while."}
{"input": "Yummy but the staff refused to make a frappacino I have ordered at least three times before at the same location and at least fifty times before in my lifetime at other locations. Also she didn't get half my order then while we waited for it she lectured me about how old my request was . Oh come on. I just want to go to home. I won't be back. But I will say once I got my order to where she would be willing to make it it was very good"}
{"input": "The music and drinks were good. Bouncers were EXTREMELY disrespectful. I would not go back. It's a shame because the music was good and the atmosphere was fun."}
{"input": "2nd time here. First time in Philly, we went to eat here. We loved the food and the price is reasonable. We ordered the same stuff, salt and pepper pork chop, sautéed string beans and vegetable fried rice. We recommend this place. Accepts credit cards for orders $20 and over."}
{"input": "After golf: Cold spring. Bloody's and beers.\n\nThe BBQ beef sandwich is a classic.\n\nAnd the Sierra Nevada beer drenched Onion Rings?\nDynamite.\n\nIf the 19th hole is your only sane chance for redemption and you like to score....\n\n\nThis is your place."}
{"input": "This a cozy little place, hidden downstairs off of 15th street.  It was my first time trying afghan food, and it was delicious!  Very reminiscent of indian food, so i have a definite bias there, but it's an amazing meal for around $6.  If you go with friends, you can order a bunch of dishes and get a variety of veggies along with a plate of rice.  They also offer three different salads (greek, afghan, and i cant remember the third), only one of which i liked (the afghan salad), but it comes along w/ur meal so its not a loss at all.  definitely will be visiting again soon!"}
{"input": "Soooo good! We went with a team of people and hand no clue what to get so our server suggested and brought us a mix of things, all so delicious. There was something for everyone. It was unique and classic and hearty all in one. The black spaghetti is a must try (don't remember the name!) Service was phenomenal! The location was super convenient too, the whole street was lively and inviting!"}
{"input": "This place is amazing! My friends and I just happened to stumble upon it, and we felt so lucky. It's delicious, affordable, fresh, and authentic. The people there even gave us a free extra dish just because they wanted us to try it. We tried it and loved it!"}
{"input": "Jhonny's Pest Control, a local local company, has been very attentive in making sure that our clients are satisfied with the work they do. Their staff is very attentive and will respond to service requests within a day or even sooner. Jhonny, the owner will personally go to job sites and even do follow up treatments at no cost for our clients if initial treatments did not carry the expected results... They also do not sub-contract heat treatments anymore, which is helpful in only having to work with one contractor and not multiple; they have invested in the equipment needed for heat treatments which require a lot of coordination. I definitely recommend!"}
{"input": "We really enjoyed out dinner here. My husband and I took our tween son for dinner. His only experience with Greek Food was my Moussaka. In order to expand his horizons a bit, we shared the Sampler App and Tour of Greece Entree.\n\nEverything was seasoned perfectly and delicious. The waiter was prompt and courteous while avoiding bothering us every few minutes.\n\nSome of the portions are pricey for their size on the App but were plated nicely. We will be going back.\n\nOne note, I noticed worry on other diners faces when they spotted a child across the room. My son is used to people being surprised by his dining etiquette but I would not bring an ill mannered or unpredictable child along."}
{"input": "I'm not really into the fast food scene BUT Chick fil A is a step above. Great quality food! I don't feel like I'm eating a ton of fillers!"}
{"input": "My last full day in New Orleans and I HAD to come here!! Came in the pouring rain too!! I really wanted some authentic New Orleans style food (yes... it's still authentic if it's vegan, I don't care what you say! Lol!) Jamone was nice enough to give me a little taste of everything, so I could pick. That just made it harder, because I wanted it ALL!!. I'm telling you,  there is no bad choice here. Everything was SO good and flavorful!! And the bread pudding was the topper for me! I would be a regular if I lived out here! Do yourself a favor and come try this place. Come hungry too, so you can have it all, like me!  Oh...and the other great thing.  This is one vegan place where they give you a TON of food without emptying your wallet!!! Amazing food and service!!"}
{"input": "All I can really say is WoW.  The flavors were fantastic.  Quattro Formaggi, Crudo and Sea Salt and Rosemary.  The service was great.  The open pizza area was great to watch these guys at their work.  Beer list is awesome.  What else can I say.  Go.  Eat Pizza the way it should have always been."}
{"input": "Had a great time on the dinner cruise with friends. Thankfully the weather was breezy so it was fun standing outside on the bow, especially as the lights came on on shore. The music was delightful and it was a really fun way to cap off our vacation in NOLA."}
{"input": "I've only been here to pick up an outpatient, my father.  I was greeted warmly, right away, and though he has a difficult last name, the receptionist had no problem finding him.  She even told me that he was a great patient- funny and cheerful.  She told me to have a seat and that he'd be out soon.  He was out in approximately 5 minutes happy and mostly pain-free from the injection he received.  I wouldn't be able to give this facility a full review, but they treated me well while I waited."}
{"input": "Ordered a Passion Passport, I love the name! It contains Passion Fruit Juice Blend, Bananas, Pineapple Mango Juice Blend, Papaya Juice Blend, and Raw Cane Sugar. It was delicious and refreshing!"}
{"input": "I have a PCP here for the past 3 years. She is wonderful. She gets my form approved for Medicaid transportation every year. She refills my psych meds when I'm in a bind. If anyone is looking for a PCP go to dr maria delacruz. Shes sweet and spends as much time as you need. Sometimes it takes a few weeks to get a appt. But if your really sick you can get in right away"}
{"input": "LOVE this tea room and the owners are SUPER SWEET!!!  I've been to several events over the past few weeks and they are so professional, the tea is wonderful and the food is fabulous!!!  My favs are the scones and fresh creme, the herbal teas, and the cucumber sandwiches!!!! You can call to book special events, baby showers, bridal showers and more!"}
{"input": "Delicious top shelf pastries. I am outraged at the poor ratings. If you're looking for cheapness over flavor then go to Panera. Service has always been exceedingly pleasent when I go, and I am an obnoxious needy customer. We are so excited to have them make macaroons for our wedding."}
{"input": "I simply love this place, best breakfast in New Orleans by far ...... Ok so I must say more for this to be a review!!\nI had banana foster French toast to die for, the shrimp and grits are perfect. Not over season with Really creamy grits & a Fresh carrot& apple juice cold and refreshing omelet with ham cheese and avocado AMAZING!!!! Diet starts soon"}
{"input": "WOW!  I come to town once every 4 months and always make sure to stop by here at least once a visit.  That smoked mackerel is just something you can't get anywhere else.  The frosted mug of root beer only makes it better."}
{"input": "Awesome bar area.  Very customer service oriented.  GREAT location.  What more could you ask for?"}
{"input": "Wow have things changed at this location. I used to come here on a regular basis with a friend. I haven't been back in over a year and so couldn't wait to have lunch today. I was surprised at the deterioration in customer service...,.our server didn't smile, was unwilling to give a recommendation and didn't offer us a tea to go. When I used to come, every server was friendly, gave suggestions and always offered a tea to go. \n\nThe food was okay and probably would have been better if we had been treated better.  I noticed there was tape on the benches where the leather/vinyl is wearing out; this looks tacky.\n\nThis used to be my favorite lunch spot; this is no longer the case. I will not be back."}
{"input": "I really do enjoy this food. You can tell it is made with care and consideration. Overall delicious."}
{"input": "Excellent service! They were super fast, friendly and professional.  This is now my go to place for oil changes"}
{"input": "Corropolese is a staples in these parts. If you're looking to get tomato pie, it's sacrilege to go anywhere else for it! Now I will admit, they do offer a variety of other items, but I couldn't tell you what they are. Whenever an event calls for a tomato pie, this is where my family goes. No one does it better!"}
{"input": "Have Abita IPA. Got the fried chicken. It was decent. Loaded with hot sauce. Going a bit too commercial. Wait staff is awesome."}
{"input": "I had takeout because it was about 45 min prior to closing . I ordered the puttanesca. It was delicious . Perfect combo of salty spiciness. There was such a wide variety of menu combos or you could get the fold and creat your own . Genius ! My only gripe is they need to come up with a gluten free dough option. My tummy will pay for this gluttony later ."}
{"input": "Just moved into town and our family went for a bike ride.  Both my husband and myself had flats after about 15 minutes on the trail.  I called Eastside Cycles the next day and they fit me in...fixed both our bikes within a few hours.  amazingly fast and courteous.  great place!"}
{"input": "Worst experience ever!!!! \n\nI stood in line today for 1 hour and 20 minutes for 1 shot. They the walked up in front of me and closed the line. Told me they were done and leaving. There were 60 people behind me outraged as well. F*** this place"}
{"input": "Hi-energy gym!! I joined in Atlanta and was visiting Tampa and able to use my Perms Plus membership in Tampa. I took the yoga class which was nice. The gym is bigger and has more equipment than the Perimeter location in Atlanta. Parking in the garage was free up to two hours and I got to guest passes for local coworker."}
{"input": "Mediocre food, decent service.  Excellent fountain Coke.  My advice: If you have to eat here, use the salsa (which was way too sweet) to add some flavor to the rest of your meal.\n\nI was amazed by how many restaurants are in this shopping center... the fact that Estela's is still in business is bad commentary on the rest of them"}
{"input": "Great good-sized sandwiches, fresh, closest that you'll get to NY. Potato salad was awesome. Service is great. Will definitely be returning."}
{"input": "We've eaten here several times and the food has always been just delicious! 4 of us went this past Tuesday and the food was a knock out! I felt like I was in the DR!! We each had a different dish so we could try it all and it was all delicious! Shrimp was perfect, oxtail was amazing ( I'm a fan of oxtail and this is best ever!) goat was served in a rich broth that was not greasy and the best of the best was the whole fried snapper!!! It was so good, I that if I closed my eyes, I could easily be in the Caribbean!!  Awesome! I can't wait to go back and try the chicken and rice, the ropa vieja and those amazing empanadas! Oh, did I mention the reasonable price?\n\nA very nice evening and a 5 star Caribbean experience, right here in 'ol St Louis!"}
{"input": "Our second time we ordered from this place.  We placed an order at 600 told us it would be about 45 minutes. One pizza one order of fries and a hoagie and a bottle of Diet Coke. It's now 715 and a girl comes to our door with my husbands sandwich which the driver forgot to take with our order and asks if we got our food yet?  My husband said no we didn't.  Another half hour goes by and the kid brings us the pizza and fries which are ice cold.  Then asks him if he got his soda and again we said no. He said he would be right back,  1/2 hour longer he finally comes with it after we have already tried to eat the cold horrible food. Now I know I should ha e gone to pick it up since we are only right down the road but wanted to spend time with my grandson and have a great night.  It's pretty bad when a 6 year old won't even eat the pizza which by the way is his favorite.  NEVER AGAIN!  Wasted 30.00!!!!!"}
{"input": "I love Skyline Chili.  I first had this stuff in Cincinnati, and I was thrilled to when a location opened in Clearwater. \n\nThis particular Skyline, however, is not great.  The service is generally poor, and the food comes out very slowly.   It seems like every time that I go, they are \"out\" of something, or some equipment isn't working.  Sometimes it's baked potatoes, sometimes it is french fries, sometimes it is something else.\n\nLove the cheese coney hot dogs all the way!\n\nI hope this location can get their act together."}
{"input": "I would absolutely recommend this place. The authentic Ethiopian food is something you won't be able to find anywhere else in Reno and probably beyond. \n\nI recommend the gored gored and zil zil tibs...both beef dishes. Ye beg tibs is a delicious lamb dish. They serve a poultry dish among others. One dish that my kids love is called alicha. \n\nRead about the bread they use to eat with called \"teff.\" It is good for people who need gluten free diets and is also high in iron. \n\nIf you hate eating processed crap that 95% of restaurants will poison you with, then try this place which uses natural ingredients and doesn't make you feel terrible after you eat. It's worth the price for this amazing cuisine."}
{"input": "This is the tour to take when visiting New Orleans!  Great experience and an even greater tour guide.  He made sure we saw the biggest gator he could find. He also pointed out all the various wildlife throughout the swamp. Make sure you cross this off your bucket list!"}
{"input": "The staff was very friendly and helpful. The place was clean. They have a couple tables outside. Some of the food was really good but some of it lacked the spice I expected. I would go there again to explore more of the menu. Try it."}
{"input": "Rude, inattentive, uneducated and they always make you feel that you are bothering them. I have started using mobile order because it's one less idiot to deal within the chain. When they start making $15 an hour we will be ordering from kiosks and maybe dealing with one person."}
{"input": "I went here for happy hour a few weeks ago, and as I was disappointed that there was no \"happy hour\" I was not disappointed in  my experience in village whiskey. The drinks were fantastic- great exotic combinations. The veggie burger was probably the best I have ever consumed. I have been here several times when I cannot even get in for a seat, so be prepared. The drinks are small and expensive but delicious, but hte food is reasonably priced. I will definitely be back!"}

{"input": "Went on Saturday night for the 9:45 show to see the headliner Bob Marley.  Arrived early and had a drink before the doors opened. \n\nAs we were ushered we were asked whether we wanted to sit on the main floor or up a bit further in the back. Really appreciated that!\n\nThe servers were friendly and the service was quick for the amount of people in there! Being DD it was nice that they did not charge for a glass of water. (Thank you!)\n\nThe host, comedians and the headliner were really funny and kept us laughing all night. What a great time out! Can't wait to return with a group of friends to do it again!"}
{"input": "The reviews did not disappoint. The chargrilled oysters were the BEST!!!! Shrimp po boy fried fish po boy seasoned and fried to perfection. Ask for Shirley. Even though she is a Met fan we won't hold that against her. She is an excellent server. Will be back."}
{"input": "Very friendly and helpful staff. The dentists are very professional. Clean office and modern equipment. I feel like I'm an actual patient here and not a dollar sign."}
{"input": "Got the island green smoothie, pretty good prices and great tasting smoothie. Detoxing this Wolfpack sweet sixteen loss away"}
{"input": "All the food is pretty lack luster. Carne asada fries are less than lack-luster. The tacos are tiny, which would be fine if they didn't cost so much."}
{"input": "We have used Reno Vulcanizing for several years now and will not take a vehicles to anyone else. Ken, Bruce and all the other staff I have dealt with are always honest, courteous and helpful."}
{"input": "The food was good but service was ridiculous. A friend and I had bought a coupon book in support of the local high schools baseball team- one coupon being burger up. The coupon gave us a free milkshake with a purchase of a burger. Each of us being on separate checks and had our own separate coupons. The red headed server approached us with attitude and poor service not even asking us what milkshake we wanted when she had done it to the table next to ours. This was extremely frustrating and I will not be returning to Burger Up"}

{"input": "Picking up a roast and ordering meat for christmas;we decided to have a hamburger since it was late in the day and we didn't have any lunch.\nSarah made us one of the best hamburgers both of us had ever had.\nSo Porterhouse not only has great meats/seafood but a great deli and fresh made sandwiches.\nWe love Porterhouse"}
{"input": "I really wanted bagel and lox but they were out of bagels so I opted for the lox eggs Benedict. It came out with the lox fried! Yuck! Since I won't send anything back unless it is inedible I lived with it. I just don't understand frying lox. Who does that?  Otherwise this is a good diner with attentive wait staff but I just can't get past the fried lox.  Lox, by definition, are not cooked but smoked only. If it is going to be fried, then it's just salmon."}
{"input": "I went into this store today to buy a new phone and it was quite possibly the most awkward experience I've ever had in a retail store. I honestly should have just bought my phone online and not had to deal with the staff. The only reason that I went into the store was because they are usually really good and will transfer the data and settings from your old phone onto the new one and they will open and put whatever protection you decide to buy onto your device. This time however, there was never even an offer to do any of that. Not that I can't do that myself (I obviously had to), it was honestly just not the service that I had grown accustomed to for this location. Next time, I will definitely just be purchasing my device online."}
{"input": "This place is a very nice sit down or take out place. I tried the famous hot dog and it was delicious, the beans gave it just the right texture. I also had the Tortta de pollo. It was very good. And my sister got the veggie tacos and they were also delicious. The customer service was great, friendly and accommodating. I will be back"}
{"input": "Probably the the worst place ever still didn't get all that was ordered!! The picture of margarita is just a picture of ice ! And margarita mix WOW only 1 waitress ! Was not but maybe 5 tables to wait on WOULD NOT RECOMEND COMING HERE . will not return"}
{"input": "Don't let the size of the place fool you!  It's tiny with small tables and you'll have to twist your way around the chairs to get to the back corner, but the food is great.\n\nI really appreciate that the rice they served with the curry was a good hefty helping and not dry like other places.  The curries are really rich with flavor...so good!  The price is pretty much about $10-12 per person on average for a standard plate.  It goes up a bit for the more fancy add-ins.\n\nAnd for those of you who can't handle spicy too well like me, don't forget to request it mild because they won't ask you how you like it and it'll come served with a kick like it's supposed to (still yummy though...just order two more glasses of water lol).  We ordered the pumpkin curry, pineapple curry, and pad thai.\n\nLove the food, but the venue is pretty cramped."}
{"input": "Cheap food and large selection. Unfortunately, they forgot our order, we waited 15 minutes and they were not even sorry about it. Bad customer service."}
{"input": "good bun, pho, and bahn mi, haven't explored the rest of the menu"}
{"input": "My husband and I held our wedding reception at Hendel's Cafe and it was gorgeous, just a beautiful night and a perfect place in which to spend with our closest friends and family!"}
{"input": "This is authentic Chinese.  At first I was taken aback when the hostess tried (successfully) to talk me out of \"american\" chinese dishes and try something more authentic.  That was my first experience with Cumin Lamb.  Wow!  My only complaint is that the spiciness varies widely every time I get it.  Must be different chefs all the time."}
{"input": "The platter was very tasty and they give you more vegetables like onions, peppers, cucumbers, and tomatoes compared to other places. It's not my favorite cart but still a good stand by. I got the combo over rice with white and hot sauce, plus a drink, all for $5.00 :)"}
{"input": "Had dinner at cortina. 3rd time since they opened.  Food is OK but still doesn't quite do it for me. Also service in the restaurant has been below average every time not as bad at the bar."}
{"input": "I prefer this place over Banana Leaf or Penang in the Chinatown area. Food tastes good, good vegetarian options. I just like fusion places like this featuring food from a particular region in Asia. \n\nGood first impression when I came with a friend. Definitely will be back to try out more dishes."}
{"input": "I love this place. Super friendly. The interior design is really cute and fits the Asian theme. Food is always good. This is my regular sushi joint. They also serve Thai food. I tried the pad Thai. It was alrightttt. I've had better. But I love their sushi rolls. A MUST try is the Spicy Crawfish Roll and the BlueCrab Tempura roll. I don't think it's on the menu you have to order it. They don't always have crawfish though. Make sure to ask for extra eel sauce and sriracha for more sauce if you like it that way. I sure do! They also have happy hour. BOGO drinks. And happy hour on sushi too. Definitely worth checking out. Would recommend to anyone interested in sushi and Asian food."}
{"input": "I have been going to Tampa Shoe Repair for a few weeks now and Rick has been very accommodating making me, my wife's hero since it's her shoes that I am bringing. Rick makes no excuses...I believe he is from New York and brings that attitude here, but in a good way.  He is a good/hard worker and is straight and to the point. I had called other places before going to him, but he was actually the only one that was nice on the phone.  They are very busy, but it should not be confused with rude.  There are not too many shoe repair places and he is go go go the entire time to include his worker as well.  I will continue to use him.  Yes, sometimes the tickets are a waste of time, but he has always found the shoes...no problem.  At the end of the day, what matters is that my wife's shoes are good as new and they always are.  Thanks Rick!!  Fugeddaboudit!"}
{"input": "Very fast service, good food, and a fun/kitschy Mexican restaurant atmosphere. This is the kind of place I go to when I'm craving regular, good, fast Mexican food."}
{"input": "The food here is above average and the service is fantastic!\n\nThe owner, Teddy, and his wife are personable, nice, and amazing with names.  We have eaten in and had food delivered more times than I can count.  It is great to have a Chinese restaurant like this in our area as we have all been to \"not so great\" places that can just make your stomach turn.\n\nShanghai Express is and overall great experience and I would recommend to all!"}
{"input": "I had a date and Blue Sage and my favorite part was being able to eat ANYTHING off the menu!!! I loved not worrying about hidden bacon and things! The food was very good. We ordered a bunch of yummy stuff! The Yukon Quesadilla is what I had, and it was good, but a little greasy. Even my meat-loving bf loved this place! The only bad points were the greasiness and the tightness in the restaurant."}
{"input": "Gumbo ya ya ...... most excellent!  The best!  A Texan in our party said it wasn't the real gumbo...how does a Texan know that?  We listened to our tastebuds and they over ruled her.  \n\nGet the Gumbo Ya Ya"}

{"input": "I believe the gentlemen at the front desk name was Kris? He was great, the rain was coming down so hard and he went above and beyond and walked me as well as Leo with an umbrella to the car! \nI have taken Leonidas there for about two years now, unfortunately he is a nervous Nelly, but we started seeing Dr. Deutsch and he has been the best with Leo! He is thorough and takes his time to ensure Leo is comfy."}
{"input": "We were looking forward to checking out one of Besh's restaurants while visiting New Orleans and decided on Luke's.  We were not disappointed.  \n\nFor drinks, we started with the Champagne Au Peche and the French \"75\" which tasted like a cady margarita (I preferred the first drink).  The oysters were fresh and sweet and the rabbit/duck liver pate was delicious!  We went back again just for the pate!  For dinner, my bf had the mussels which were nice and buttery and I had the entrecote with bernaise sauce...yum.  The decor; simple, bistro style...nothing too fancy with nice, laid back service."}
{"input": "I was actually disappointed after reading the good reviews here. Had beef kabob and it tasted good but pretty boring. Jasmine rich with a little sauce on top. Service was a bit slow but it was full at lunch time. Price is ok, 7.50 for my beef kebab."}
{"input": "I really like Prep & Pastry - we have been twice in the last two months on a Sunday.  The best trick I learned is to put your name on the waitlist BEFORE YOU ARRIVE.  As long as you are within 5 miles of the restaurant, you can be added.  It is a great service.\n\nI have tried a number of things for brunch and all have been excellent - even their sweets. I think my favorite is the breakfast sandwich.  I am not a big drinker, so I usually order the ice team and it really is better than almost anything else I have tried. \n\nStaff is really, really nice.  I highly recommend a visit if you are in town."}
{"input": "I went in for a mani and pedi. My student was a nice person and we chatted. However it took 3 hours and my hands just look terrible. The feet are fine and feel great. Hands, just terrible. No one came and checked in if the work was done properly. I'm fine that it takes longer, they are there to learn. However, I shouldn't have been charged for the manicure (pedicure yes) or at least have someone else redo my nails. See the pictures for yourselves, this is 15 minutes out!\n\nEdit: just wanted to add that when I removed my shoes, my pedi was ruined. I asked if it was ready to put shoes on and I was told yes. 2 stars only because at least my student was nice but 0 for the service (34$!)"}
{"input": "Best pizza in my neighborhood. Better than NYPD, Zios, Pandora's, etc. I highly recommend the personal size for one person. Their eggplant pizza is outstanding. I'm also a big fan of sausage and mushroom. The sausage is actual slices of Italian sausage, not those nasty crumbly bits you get at a lot of places. Prices are reasonable.\n\nHaven't been too impressed with the rest of the menu, but for pizza near Jefferson, I don't think you can do any better. Burgers aren't bad too."}
{"input": "My dryer went out on the coldest day of the year. I had to quickly find a laundromat to wash and dry. Yolanda, the onsight attendant, could tell I was a newbie. She took the time to tell me which washers would work best for me, told me how much detergent to use and was right there to help me with the dryers. She keeps the place clean, constantly mopping the floor and cleaning off the machines. The atmosphere is very comfortable. I would highly recommend it if you ever find yourself in need of a laundromat!"}
{"input": "Mike and his people are top notch.  Very competent, used them twice with no issues... fair pricing, fast work.  Highly recommend!   JJ"}
{"input": "This place is really amazing! Its definitely a hidden gem away from the major city streets that deserves 5 stars and more! Go for brunch- the bloody Mary is so tasty and by itself is worth the trip. We tried the Andouille and Cheese Grits, Crabby Eggs, Crawfish Beignet and Lemon Ricotta Pancakes all of which were so good but the Crawfish Beignet and Lemon Ricotta Pancakes changed my breakfast food standards forever!"}
{"input": "Food was ok. We were there to watch playoff hockey. Waitress was horribly inattentive. Never did bring water even though I asked for it three times. She hardly stayed at the table long enough for us to even ask for appetizer and had to flag her down multiple times for everything else that evening."}
{"input": "I like the Clue game lookalike of this hotel. Respectful bell boys and valet drivers, bartenders delivering our drinks to our rooms quickly, phone etiquette with nice customer service, and my gf and I would come back to this hotel next year, great area, a little busy streets in downtown Boise. Coming from Cali, this service is phenomenal. Thank you guys. Watch your money spending here. Mine as well walk around and get cheaper foods to eat. The con's is no air vent in bathrooms especially of ours."}
{"input": "It's Joe's Crab Shack which doesn't need a lot more detail, however the staff here go above and beyond.  The food of coarse sells itself, love it"}
{"input": "good Mexican food.. I recommend the chicken enchiladas. service is excellent and I recommend sitting outside where it's quiet and hopefully sunny. I found the inside to be so noisy it sounds like a betting area in a casino."}
{"input": "I ate here twice in three days, it was that good. Everything is homemade, the environment (a former house) is really intimate and fun. The rolls are amazing and service was great. I highly recommend for a good steak or the sea bass!"}
{"input": "So this is a Jon besh restaurant and you might expect things.  You would be correct.  We stopped in for a late lunch after the day at the WWII museum.  As we doy wife and I ordered two different things and split to get to eat two different things. I ordered the Luke burger and she ordered the coque Madame.  I ate my burger and discovered the best burger I ever had.  Onions had a great sweet taste and the bacon was great with wonderfully cheese.  Then I tasted my wife's offering and I knew the burger was not the correct choice.  There was running egg and great cheese and cream sauce and wonderfully tasty ham.  The Fry's were not the best but the egg and cheese made it all worth it."}
{"input": "Yum and yum.   What a cute place w great food!  Have been twice and will be back again soon.   The burger, the crème brûlée pork belly special, are two instant faves.   I almost don't want people to know about this place so it doesn't get over crowded!"}
{"input": "Love the vegetarian burger. The desserts are alright."}
{"input": "Excellent deep dish pizza. Prolly the best local pizza in St. Louis. Come early on thur-sat night as it takes a long time to cook."}
{"input": "Impeccable food and service! We figured if we were gonna do Sbraga, we needed the chefs counter 6 course with wine pairings. A pricy endeavor but no regrets. I loved having a front row view of the deliciousness about to be laid in front of me. The team behind the line on this particular Saturday night ran like a well oiled machine. \n\nThe tone was set with the amuse Gruyere popover with foie gras soup. Heavenly! There were no duds on the menu, but other standouts were the saffron spaghetti with blue crab, the crispy Arctic char and the chicken liver mousse (btw I thought I hated chicken liver). The wines were matched very well. \n\nMy friend was celebrating a birthday so I included that in the notes when making the reservation. To top off the experience, they gave her a note signed by Sbraga and a little goodie bag. Can't wait to return!"}
{"input": "My favorite Italian restaurant in Tucson. Family owned since the 1930's or 40's. Excellent lasagna and chicken parmesean. Why people flock to the Olive Garden over this place is beyond me...."}
{"input": "Ok, the dinner was terrible. Just awful. I am not fond of tasteless fried chicken and nearly dry cornbread. The wine was OK. \n\nBut the tour and the rest of the experience was amazing!\n\nThe Steamboat offers dinner, jazz and an awesome cruise up and down the river with a fantastic overview of the history along the way. It was an informative and authentic experience worth the ticket. And while it was busy in our tour, there were still plenty of spaces to walk and sit and enjoy the view. And, as with everything else in New Orleans, you can take your drink with you.\n  \nOh! And the jazz music is live! And you can visit the engine room. Too cool!\n\nDo not forget a hat and sunscreen!"}
{"input": "First time here. Great bar and restaurant area. Open floor plan with plenty of TV's to watch the game. Attached to their O'Fallon brewery (in Maryland Heights, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis). They ranked 2nd in the St Louis area last year for volume of beer sold by a micro brewery. Today, I tried the House Special IPA...a wonderful IPA, not too bitter, just right. Look for Troy behind the bar! (The only reason for 4 stars is no desserts....)"}
{"input": "I love all types of barbecue, and Judge Bean's Texas-style brisket is no exception!  Ultra yummy and tender, and really spicy too!  I have had lots of different items from the menu.  \n\nThe small brisket plate is a great option--brisket plus 2 sides--I like the cowboy beans (spicy baked beans) and slaw.  Also, the chicken quesadilla isn't what you would normally expect.  Chicken is SO spicy, and it's pulled right off the bone.  It's fantastic.  The brisket tacos are amazing, and my all-time favorite is the shrimp diablo--a shrimp stuffed into a jalapeno with cream cheese, and wrapped with bacon.  Your mouth will be on FIRE but it's totally worth it!  \n\nI take away a star because the only location for Judge Bean's is now in Greer Stadium, where the Sounds play.  If you go to a game, be sure to go up to the restaurant on the 4th floor!  The 12th Avenue location is, sadly, closed."}
{"input": "The reviews seemed promising, maybe they had an off night, but the food here was not good. We were a small group of 3 and tried a handful of dishes: pulled pork sliders, mac and cheese, cheddar and chorizo fries, BBQ duck wings, aside from the BBQ duck wings everything was just not god, mac and cheese was watery and lacked flavor, fries were boring, sliders were just ok. With so many other restaurants popping up in this area I doubt I\"ll go back and give it a second chance. \n\nI can't say much about the drinks, I think my sister was happy with the manhattan she ordered. I got a whiskey sour, I know not very adventurous, but didn't finish it, after you've tasted a well made whiskey sour, its hard to drink any others."}
{"input": "First time customer! I decided to go for a mani and pedi Friday evening after work. My wait time was less than 10 minutes. Friendly environment and great customer service. They have so many polish options. Dip powder seems to be their most popular, which I'll try next time. I wasn't to thrilled about my pedicure because the work looked a bit sloppy, but my manicure turned out beautifully! I will be a returning customer."}
{"input": "This place is awesome. Stopped in for lunch last week and had a spirit tasting flight, delicious, then a beer tasting flight, even more delicious. Seriously good beers. Pork belly tacos were yummy, as was the artichoke and kale dip and the spinach salad with a soft boiled egg. The bartender was super knowledgeable as well and answered every question we had about the spirits, beer, food and the amazing space that they have. Ill be coming back every time I go to Reno."}
{"input": "Service here was excellent. They hosted us for an event and were awesome. \n\nHowever, I felt that is where the awesome stopped. The food I had (brisket) was mediocre at best, maybe it had been sitting under lamps all day? The bread it was served on was tough. The mac and cheese was pretty good. My glassware for beer was dirty, chilled, and they were out of everything on draft."}
{"input": "Cali did an absolute amazing job on a last minute order for delivery. I needed to get something cheerful, unique, and beautiful delivered to my MIL (who has all those same traits!) as she was in the hospital for a few days. They're all in Santa Barbara, I'm in San Diego, but Cali worked with me by phone and text and in a matter of a few hours had put together the most gorgeous arrangement. \nShe used a unique piece of pottery from Unurth out of Thousand Oaks and she added an array of colorful succulents for a cheerful look. The sea glass topping she added gave it a soothing vibe. I'm thoroughly impressed with Cali's skill and customer service! The best part is that this arrangement will last well beyond any flowers or balloons that I could have had delivered."}
{"input": "Spent July 4th weekend here and we loved it! Cleanliness is my main concern and we couldn't be happier with this place! I actually left my own pillows and blanket in the car! \n\nAside from the lack of luggage cart when we checked in, their washer/dryer not working properly and the need to always tell the parking attendant to get our cars every time we needed to get something, I would definitely go back when we visit NOLA again. The location is great too and did I mention they're really clean?"}
{"input": "What a scam!  UPS stores charge $2.50 to 'for use of a computer' to put a USB drive into a computer and 9 cents for the print out.  Even for a UPS label.\nwhy would someone pay $2.59 just to print one piece of paper when FedEX/Kinkos and OfficeMax/Office Depot charges 11 cents???  Go elsewhere."}
{"input": "Had high hopes for Convivio since the pasta is freshly made. We had the meatball appetizer, the rigatoni and the tagliatelle bolognese. Overall although fresh, the food had no flavor at all. The bread and flavored oil were good to start, our wine (the Sangiovese) was good and our waiter seemed like a good dude (can't remember his name). That's where it ended, though. The rigatoni was undercooked (even for al dente) and the tagliatelle was over cooked. The bolognese was bland and the rigatoni didn't taste right at all. This is a restaurant with bad food so it's hard to rate it highly even though the experience was good."}
{"input": "Awesome English Pub! Great food and amazing place to watch a game! We watched a soccer game with a fantastic crowd and stayed to watch baseball after. I highly recommend the HMS Belfast! Fantastic happy hour! Can't beat a $2 beer! Happy hour all day on Saturdays!"}
{"input": "Right in Frenchman's street, wanted to try some authentic food the decor is simple, it was my first time eating jambalaya so I have nothing to compare it to but I enjoyed it for sure"}
{"input": "This is one of the best if not THE best BBQ places in the Tampa Bay area.  Seriously smoky and delicious meats, especially the ribs and the brisket.  \n\nWe go here every now and then for the darn cheap brisket and pulled pork sandwiches and bring back a bunch for the office as well.  That always gets us some brownie points... :-)\n\nI hate to admit it, but I've never gotten any sides here before.  I don't even know if they HAVE sides their meats are so good.  And after all, isn't the point of BBQ the smoked meat?  \n\nI know this is a BBQ truck BUT it's a heck of a lot cheaper than Hungry Harry's (also GREAT bbq) but is of similar or slightly better flavor and quality.  \n\nIf you want to sit down to eat your bbq, just bring it back to your car and take a lean on the hood as you enjoy your brisket with the traffic whirring by."}
{"input": "love vegan food.\nshared a ziggy burger with a friend. presentation was cute...wrapped in brown parchment paper like a baseball.\ntempah patty was delicious-warm and crispy.  texture was nice and meat like.\nsauce on burger added to its juiciness and richness.  \n\nit was a very filling burger, although i only had half of it. \ni can totally eat here daily!"}
{"input": "Horrible!!! Not only did i wait over and hour and 40 mins for delivery my order was wrong and apparently the use a cell phone as their business phone and every time I called to inform them my order was wrong the kept hitting the button to send the call to voicemail! I will never order from there again and I can't see them staying in business for very long If that's how they run their business."}
{"input": "This is a great addition to the STL dining scene. Bacon fat fried cornbread is a must. It's so light and the honey butter drizzle on top gives just a touch of sweetness. Great way to start the meal. The smoked beet salad had the perfect balance of smoke flavor, fresh beets, crunch and creaminess. The burger was amazing. There was a little too much bread for me on the burger, but overall it was amazing. Butterscotch pudding did not disappoint. This place is incredible and I cannot wait to return."}
{"input": "My husband and I come here often. We love the food here, it's always fresh and the service is great. We highly recommend this place to anyone who loves sushi & hibachi."}
{"input": "NEVER AGAIN. This is a so called restaurant that does nothing that a restaurant should other than prepare food, because the rest is done by the patron. Want water? Get up and go across the yard to get it. Want a drink, walk up a flight of stairs and pay cash. Want to sit in a dirty yard in dirty lawn chairs, enjoy yourself. The wait staff is mildy helpful in that they bring you your food after you go to the window and pay cash for it...kind of like New Orleans Hamburger and Seafood, but dirty and with live music (which is nice). It's a one in a lifetime experience for me...just once."}
{"input": "I've eaten here numerous times and every time it's been absolutely fantastic. Great food, nice people, calm and quiet place. Their crepes are the best crepes I have ever had. Amazingly delicious. I recommend this place to my friends all the time. I've always heard great things from them as well."}
{"input": "Mediocre at best. Service was very slow. It took 5 min. just to get a menu. Place was not very clean. Breakfast sandwich was average and breakfast burrito was not flavorful. Biscuits and gravy were tasty but again, just average."}
{"input": "Hands down the best spaghetti & meatballs I've ever had. The atmosphere here is so nice and cozy. It has just won out as my favorite Italian restaurant."}
{"input": "Went on a Tuesday night for a couple of drinks. It's the perfect relax, chill place to have some beers over nice conversation. They are pretty laid back and you can sit either inside or outside by their porch, which sometimes can be super crowded. I will definitely be back!"}
{"input": "Such a cool atmosphere and unlike anything I've ever been to. You walk into the wine and cheese shop, select a bottle (or 2!) and then select whatever cheeses and meats you so choose from a refrigerator. Once you have your items, you bring it to the counter to pay, they take your cheeses and meats, and deliver it to your outside (or upstairs inside in our case due to the rain!) and it's like magic. It comes back a beautiful cheese board with nuts and spreads and a delicious loaf of sliced artisan bread! Highly recommended! They also have a menu t order from the kitchen if you really need more, but two of us were full after our platter and wine!"}
{"input": "I've been going to Boise Therapeutic Massage for 4 years now.  I'm giving it 5 stars because I can always get an appointment the day I call, every therapist is exceptional, and the price is reasonable.  I've never been disappointed.  It isn't a fancy spa but their clinic is relaxing and the staff makes you feel welcome and I go for the massage and not the spa experience anyway.  I've started going to Amy exclusively for all my massages. It's wonderful when you find someone who knows where your trouble spots are and can make you feel human again."}
{"input": "Finally an authentic Mexican taqueria! You know you're in the right place when it's packed with the locals. Hard to get a table on the weekends. Menu is small, prices are average, the tacos are packed with meat, but the star here are the handmade corn tortillas. Walking into this place I felt like I was back in Mexico visiting family. I would've given them 5 stars but one of the ladies there was rude when I asked for a fork. She said,\"they're tacos. You don't eat them with a fork.\" Well duh, but I use it to pick up all the meat that spills out of the taco. Whatever. Not a fancy place but food is good."}
{"input": "Tonight I went to Superior Grill expecting a delicious tex mex meal with great vibes. First it began with the rude waitress, then the manager came over and made in an appropriate \"joke\" regarding my ethnicity. The cherry on top to this awful evening was when i was served lifeless skinned rubber meat on a platter with lettuce and PEANUT SAUCE, what mexican restaurant puts peanut sauce on a salad. I would recommend not going here EVER unless you want slithery chicken weenus sliding down your throat."}
{"input": "The depot burger is so delicious along with the shishito peppers! Perfect food, perfect atmosphere, perfect drinks!"}
{"input": "I got the bazooka toast, it was amazing! A little bit pricey but totally worth it. So good it inspired me to give my first yelp review :)"}
{"input": "Blues city deli is seriously the best sandwich place in the city!! My personal favorites are the 7th street Sicilian and the Benton Park. I go at least once a week and the fact that I look forward to it could be considered sad\nBut everything is always that good!"}
{"input": "They run on Peruvian time.  This is like a three-woman-run  place.  I have to give the lady lots of credit for maintaining her cool.  She was the waitress, the server, and the sous chef.  I guess one lady was the chef.  Food came out extremely slow.  Find a good friend and spend time to catch up with each other or bring your IPad to play your game.  The food was fresh and good.  I love the crunchy chips.  If you check in with Yelp, you might get a free soda.  We had the chicken soup and Aji de Gallina, sauce with chicken, potato, and rice. If you like gravy, this would be the thing for you."}
{"input": "Great cheesesteak! Friendly and fast service. Lazo's really made my day."}
{"input": "Excellent food and service located in a cute town.. \n\nThe menu offers a variety of selections so it makes a good place for those with dietary restrictions. \n\nDefinitely recommend the lemon corn cake with the lemon curd and blueberry compote. They offer a full size order or a single. Because they are so sweet I'm not sure I could handle a full order.   We did not care for the breakfast potatoes which are 1/2 sweet and 1/2 regular potatoes."}
{"input": "Immediately upon entering you feel the Latin vibe and ambience. The lights are at a low setting but brighter than dim. There are high top tables and you usual dining size tables. The music is Latin as well.\n\nEach table includes water served out of a wine bottle....very cute yet chic presentation. The menu offers many options to suit all taste buds from pork shank, to salmon, to fried white fish tacos. The appetizers options are just enough with detailed descriptions of the dish. Nice wine and cocktail selection.\n\nThe Sangria is nicely made and taste fresh.\n\nService is attentive, but are in mind any extras or side condiments will be provided at a charge (sour cream, salsa picante, chim sauce, etc)\n\nOverall, it's a great dinner spot for a few girlfriends or a date with a new person. \n\nI would recommend dressy casual clothes and absolutely no gym shoes."}
{"input": "Such a beautiful hotel in a ideal location. You are within walking distance of anything that you might want to do. The staff was amazing. I had the pleasure of meeting Keith at the concierge. He ensured that we had everything that we needed. I appreciate the attention to customer service and I would return."}
{"input": "The only reason I came here was because there was a great deal for an oil change on Groupon. I bought it and booked the appointment online for the next day. So far, loving the experience. I show up at 3 pm for my scheduled appointment. I'm told that it will be an extra 15 minutes because they need to make a special order for my oil filter. I overhear one employee say to another, \"I was about to order that yesterday, but you know, people tend to not show up for their appointments, so I didn't order it.\" She then apologized. To the other employee. Not to me. One hour later (not 15 minutes later), a guy walks in and announces he has the oil filter. Now they can start doing the oil change, rather than an hour ago at the actual time of my appointment. Thank you for wasting the last hour of my life, Sears."}
{"input": "I'm so impressed with this coffee shop. Coming from Sacramento, my husband and I know good coffee. This place is such a gem, I wish there was something like this back in Sac! Anyways, this is my go-to Reno coffee shop for sure. Their Matcha lattes are so good. Sigh."}
{"input": "Love this place and highly recommend! I visited them today to fix another salons error. Now my nails and feet look PERFECT!!"}
{"input": "Good wings with lots of flavor choices. Good seasoned fries. Not a lot of beers to choose from bit I figure most of the people who hang out here are just fine with Budweiser and corona. Its a bit cramped but not too bad. Also, why do all the waitresses wear false eyelashes?"}
{"input": "I recently discovered that I'm gluten sensitive which makes eating anywhere else but home very difficult. For the most part I have sacrificed enjoying a meal out with family because eating something with even a risk of cross-contamination isn't worth it because I feel horrible afterward. I was thrilled when I found out about New Day here in St. Louis! At our first visit we tried the lasagna, biscuits and gravy, cheesecake, and a brownie. Yes, you can order breakfast and dinner at the same time of day and they were all very good! My husband doesn't have a gluten restriction and he loved everything as well. I'm excited about ordering some sweets and freshly baked breads and having them shipped to my home! What a nice option! :)"}
{"input": "Loved everything -- had great cocktails and wine, steak tartare that was awesome, broiled shrimp was delish, curried goat dish w/ sweet potato gnocchi was the bomb. Also had a special dish, oxtail raviolini. great choice. New favorite!"}
{"input": "They do not skimp on their sandwiches here. Solid 5 inches in diameter with tons of bacon and cheese. Not especially clean but definitely tasty."}
{"input": "Excellent service at this port of subs. Line gets extremely long on the weekends but it moves quickly. Always fresh and yummy."}
{"input": "Pretty average take-out chinese. Not bad, not the best, but id definitely eat there again. ***update--- just ate there again and they got our complex delivery perfect and the food was excellent! 5 stars now!!"}
{"input": "BEWARE ....this hotel has a case of bedbugs. I woke up at 1am scratiching my arm and I saw welts. I get out the bed turn on the light and I see one bug dead and one bug moving around in the bed. I told the night guy at the front desk to look at my video and he didn't want to see it he said you can't go back in your room we have to quarantine it. You can't grab any of your belongings. \n I ask to speak to the manager for a refund. Not only that I hope that the bugs did not get to my small luggage. The guy said he is the night auditor and can't answer any questions. He was a complete asshole After ready some reviews others have complained of bed bugs. There are many other hotels don't stay at this one."}
{"input": "I am sort of a sushi snob. \n\nI'm going to be honest. This was literally the worst sushi Ive ever had.  It was warm... WARM! (and NO! it wasn't tempura).\n\nI also paid $3 for a side salad which was literally iceberg lettuce. \n\nNope... no spring mix...no romaine...no iceberg with slivers of carrots or even purple cabbage... LITERALLY just iceberg. I was puzzled and then angry and then i had to smirk and whisper, \"well played my friend... well played\".\n\nI will never be back..\n\nCheck and Mate."}
{"input": "The food at this location was amazing. I throughly enjoyed the food and service provided by Ciara (I couldn't find my receipt, so I'm not sure if the spelling is correct). However, Ciara was pleasant, responsive, quick, and knowledgeable about the menu and the surrounding areas. I would definitely visit this location again!  P.S. the jalapeño cornbread was delicious."}
{"input": "They did a great job with my son's superhero cake. The bakery was clean and staff was very friendly and helpful when I went to order. I just showed them a couple of pictures of what I was looking for and they they came through. Everyone loved the taste too. I will definitely order here again."}
{"input": "Guy at the counter was rude, the place was filthy, and all around horrible! Would/will not recommend this place at all!"}
{"input": "First time at this place for my son and I as we attended a birthday party and it was pretty cool to have an indoor waterpark only an hour away from home.  \n\nHowever, two or three hours is for sure enough time to spend at the park -- after that you will probably be bored.  Also, the gaurds should do a better job controlling the kids in the lazy river -- it's called lazy for a reason.. not get in your tube and run as fast as you can bumping everyone out of the way.  Finally, the party it self -- it seemed as if the staff was highly un-organized and needs some better training.  Oh yea -- would you install \"locked\" light switches in the party room so the kids can switch the lights on and off!\n\nI might go back to Sahara Sam's but most likely not anytime soon."}
{"input": "This place is a hidden gem.  It is located in a strip mall, but this restaurant is anything but a strip mall restaurant.   My husband took me here for my birthday and I was blown away with the whole experience.  It's a very modern, romantic atmosphere.  The food is excellent.  I was shocked by the Fois gras-amazing.  I had the prix fixe menu and I loved ordering 3 courses.  The short ribs were great, but I want to try something new next time.  The desserts were awesome.  I usually take caramel, but there was a caramel tart that was to die for.  Can't wait to go back!!!!"}
{"input": "I like this place a lot. I stopped in once with friends for drinks and was eager to return for food. We finally did over the weekend. \n\nThe ambience is very nice -- somehow ideal for both a fun date as well as for a beer and sports crowd. \n\nI love the open kitchen. \n\nGreat beer selection. \n\nI'll definitely return for the rosemary fries, and my fiancée will return for the very good house burger."}
{"input": "I was at this restaurant yesterday...and I have to say that my entire family was disgusted of their food! We were four people and not one of us took a second bite of their food!! I am extremely shocked that this place has 3 stars let alone has people giving them 5 stars! It doesn't even deserve one star! If I could I wouldn't even give them one. Will not be returning and will be warning friends and families not to come here as well. Overall, horrible experience first time we left a restaurant hungry!"}
{"input": "It's ok, nothing great.  Prices are reasonable.  I didn't care for their sauce, too thin and watery.  Meat inside raviolis tasted a bit off to me.  My gf's alfredo was good.  Portions are fairly large so you're not going to go away hungry."}
{"input": "First things first:   The donuts are AMAZING.  Fresh, inventive, and true to their name. I tried the wedding cake, cinnamon sugar, and Nola Cream (not on the same day I swear).  The Nola cream has a slight hint of rum and reminded me of a Bushwacker for those of you familiar with the heavenly frozen-chocolatey-rum-concoction served near the Gulf Coast.  \nService was nice & fast, atmosphere was great!\nNOW- to address the comments about these donuts being a strange consistency.  The donuts here (in my opinion) have an almost beignet texture and flavor. Being from the area, I loved it and found nothing really odd about it.  Again, they are DELICIOUS."}
{"input": "I had the salted caramel donut and it was so delicious. Soft, fresh, and sweet. I also tried the pork belly slider and it was soooo delicious. I wish I had one right now. It had a wonderful combination of flavors and wonderful dressing. \n\nI was also able to see how they prepare their dish and it was nice to see all of the fresh ingredients they used"}
{"input": "Simply the best frozen custard you will ever have in the city. Do not come to St Louis, MO and not try this gem."}
{"input": "Was pleasantly surprised how much I like this place.  Vaulted ceilings, very clean, great service.  Started off with excellent Buffalo wings on the bone that were a nice size and made me break out in a happy sweat.  The meat lovers deep Dish Chicago style pizza rivaled the authentic one I actually had there, and it went down quick with knife and fork.  Now this New Yorker would say deep Dish is not pizza, butt it was still very good.  I would eat here again."}
{"input": "She was amazing both in knowledge and being dependable. We are so happy we hired her! She encouraged us to be strong and not induce too early and we had a normal vaginal birth. She was always available which was comforting as first Time Parents. But she was never pushy and accurately outlined the choices we had. Sometimes she can be strong in her language or points of view but she is our advocate! Needed in today's world. Bravo to her!!"}
{"input": "I just moved here into downtown 3 weeks ago, so  I am doing the search the best in every category as we woman do we're ever we reside, but will travel if that's what it takes to feel the comfort and trust in service .\nHaving your car run smoothly is almost as important as your nails done right and I give Cabrillo  Union 76  and its staff a well earned across the board THANKYou! \nBeing a Woman it's important to have trust in your auto service Technician. I trust this shop to give me the quality in service and repair and Smog for all my cars. \nTHANKYou Ray,\nSincerely , \n                      Cheyenne"}
{"input": "I came here on a hot night after hearing the hype about the new Thai style rolled ice cream place on South Street. And now I see what all the hype was about! The experience of watching the chefs at work was so entertaining, and the creations they came up with were deligant (delicious; elegant). I got the Pink Lady, and my sidepiece got the Bumblebee. It was lit AF. Go here."}
{"input": "Stayed here for one night prior to cruising out. Having access to the shuttle to pick my group up from the airport, take us to a restaurant for dinner and Walmart was absolutely great. Richard the shuttle driver kept us in stitches. The room was clean and neat. The breakfast was wonderful. Ms. Jenita's buttery grits were the highlight of my breakfast. Next time I'm in Tampa hands down this will be my go to hotel."}
{"input": "Seriously one of the go to restaurants for a date night with my husband. I have eaten here too many times to remember. The food is delicious! The meat eater as well as vegetarian will be equally pleased. The key to dining at Khmer is timing.  I am from this neighborhood so I know the pain of finding parking around here. Buffer in time to find a parking spot and get to Khmer early for a great experience."}
{"input": "Awesome place. I LOVE the food!  They were friendly. I ended up having them cater my sons graduation party. Carol is great"}
{"input": "Girls at front were awesome. Empty tables being held for later reservation. They said you have an hour take it!  Waitress was sweet. Food was OKAY. Tried lots of dishes with four of us. No home run. Music was fun though."}
{"input": "It's no different than any other Chinese place. Same menu, etc. this place does have some good lunch specials though, and the food is always ready when I go to pick it up."}
{"input": "I have heard rumors that this place is quiet good for a long time so I finally got around to trying it out. In the end I think it is middle of the road, the was good, I have had better. It was a better steak then you would get at a big chain like applebees or outback. The atmosphere was western with animal hides on the wall and rustic decor. The beans we were but I'm not big on beans anyhow. \n\nBetter then some, but not as good as others."}
{"input": "Big store, decent selection, plenty of parking and rather convenient location. The building is well lit, Items are always stocked, and if you have trouble finding anything - employees aren't far to ask. Everyone seems in a positive mood, happy to greet you and happy to help. I am a big fan of the fresh squeezed juice, their sandwiches, and all the snacks you can buy! I don't do my regular weekly shopping here but I still stop in frequently and pick up a thing here and there when I need or have a want for it. I have no complaints about this location! It's wonderful!"}
{"input": "My 2nd experience here was even better than the first.  I do believe there were some kinks during the grand opening.  This time around they seemed to have more than 1 beer bottle opener, and the portion size of the garlic noodle did improve.  \nThe place still looked like it would get drafty at certain tables but we were seated at a better table this time around and I was not bothered by it.  Food was amazing as ever and I am looking forward to my next visit!\nWe had no problem getting seated on a sat evening at 5pm.  So glad to have these guys in the local neighborhood.  :D"}
{"input": "The staff wasn't too interested in helping customers, instead focused on the TV in the lobby, flirting with each other and just standing around. I found the food to be ok, not great, not terrible. I'll round up from the 1.5 I give them."}
{"input": "The JW Marriott in downtown Indianapolis is absolutely beautiful with some of the best views of the city. The hotel has anything you could ask for from restaurants to the High Velocity Sports Bar to Starbucks. A few friends and I stayed here for a Bachelorette Party and its location in the city made it easy to walk to and from dinner without having to go outside in the snowy weather we had and is pretty centrally located. Although the room was not quite ready at 3:00PM when we checked and there was no fridge in the room, these were minor things compared to the excellence of this hotel. The staff was extremely helpful and made sure to assist their guests with any inquiries. The rooms were beautiful with comfortable beds and large bathrooms. I would definitely recommend this hotel not only for its amazing view of Indy, but for the excellent service they offer to all of their guests."}
{"input": "Great menu and right near the University of Arizona!\n\nThey specialize in a East coast cuisine that is fantastic no matter what you order!"}
{"input": "Very fun place. You wait in line and place your order and then pick it up when your restaurant pager buzzes. While you're waiting, go find a seat outside at one of the picnic tables all the way in the back and cross your fingers that the train will come by! This place is clearly a favorite for families with the huge sand pit and expansive lawn, so be prepared to dodge lots of small children running around.\n\nWe really wanted the ahi tuna sandwich but they didn't have any tuna (weird), so we got California burgers and they were great. The chocolate fudge shake was awesome too."}
{"input": "Great food and really good tequila drinks. The water they serve may need a new filtration system. They really need a kicked up salsa as well as the other 3, sometimes you want to feel the heat. Overall we will be back for more."}
{"input": "From the reviews here dating back to 2008, there hasn't been a price increase - hope one isn't coming soon!  :-(\n\nI've experienced the film getting \"stuck\", dodged potholes the size of tires in the parking lot, almost spilled to the floor while sitting in seats with broken latches, had to switch seats because the Duggars could afford to bring their crying family and then played on their smart phone the whole time, seated myself in the dark because the sconce lights weren't turned on prior to the movie as well as watched movies when the same lights weren't turned off, and even had to get up to shut the theatre doors myself.\n\nHowever, I've also enjoyed wonderful movies at reasonable prices,  fresh popcorn with *self-serve butter dispensers!!!*,  very friendly & speedy service from the small staff, and clean-for-its-age theatres and restrooms.\n\nYou get what you pay for here, but it's still a great value!"}
{"input": "I am from Texas and I was raised with authentic Mexican food in every corner. Living in Florida makes it difficult to find a restaurant with Mexican cooks. This isn't a place for someone that enjoys high end dining experience. However, if you are in need of eating real Mexican food this is the place. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the delicious food. I will be returning."}
{"input": "Excellent location!!   This hotel sits kitty-corner from Independence Hall entrance, right across the street from Liberty Bell and a stones-throw from many other historical significant sites in Philadelphia.  It is also an easy stroll to Penn's Landing, South Street and two blocks down from Market and 5th SEPTA station.  The rooms are the traditional Monaco decor with lots of bold wall coverings and period furniture.  Bathrooms are also nicely done with excellent water pressure and upscale finishes including free-standing tub and separate walk-in shower in the Spa King room.  Staff was very friendly and helpful as well and who can't love the daily coffee service in the morning and wine-tasting in the evenings.  My ONLY complaint would be the alley-facing rooms has to deal daily with the trash and delivery trucks at 6:30 AM sharp.  Would suggest management push to make this happen at some other time of the day."}
{"input": "Gotta love their starters. Great variety of food. I ordered Lobster Waffle, Oyster Lettuce Wrap, Suckling Pig and Duck Duck Goose. They are all delicious dishes. I would most definitely recommend the duck duck goose. I personally love the different sauces on the dish and the softness of the duck meat."}
{"input": "Finally! Great pizza & knots at the beach!!! Excellent location with a cool street presence. These guys know what they're doing."}
{"input": "Literally spent 2hrs+ making sure each curl is strategically placed  constantly asking how I like it so far and if I need any water, coffee, wine etc  and I was seriously shocked when I saw the price as it was way lower then I had expected, considering the princess treatment I had received. Thank you again. Hubby also approved"}
{"input": "Crumb de la Crumb is my favorite restaurant in Bellevue! The hospitality and warmth of the servant's hearts is felt as soon as you walk in the door. And the food is to die for. It's amazing what you can do tucked into a little nook in the heart of Bellevue. Trust me, it's worth discovering."}
{"input": "I don't know why JJT has such a crummy star rating on Yelp. This place is great. \n\nIt's cozy, cute, serves delish coffee, and has yummy biscotti on the side. I love the independent coffee shop vibe and I love that they have Open Mic Night's on Friday. When I want to \"check out\" and relax, I come here for a bit. It's also perfect on a snowy day.\n\nJust know... it's a $10 minimum to use a CC."}
{"input": "Came back here and had the pancakes. They were light, fluffy and delicious. It was a bit pricey at about $8 for a double stack compared to other places but I like supporting local establishments."}
{"input": "Ordered the Classic Margarita pizza and it was fantastic!  This place has the best crust and cheese!  The employee who took our order was very kind and the service was pretty quick.  Will definitely be stopping by again the next time I am back in Santa Barbara."}
{"input": "I brought my two littlest sisters here one rainy morning for pre-City Museum nourishment  and we were very impressed by the creative confections at Strange Donuts. From classics such as the Fat Steve's and glazed dones, to fun creations like the Fetty Wap and the Gooey Butter donut we had a great breakfast. I definitely recommend getting here earlier than later to make sure you get first crack at the fun donuts, and be sure to get enough to share because they'll disappear FAST!"}
{"input": "Super friendly people. Always helpful. It's a great place to take the kids. They even like the food!!"}
{"input": "My care at Temple has been so great that I am very hesitant to go outside of the system for any doctor. I also work for the organization and believe in the judgement of the professionals here. I've seen how much they place the patient at the center of what they do. Since moving from Massachusetts to Philadelphia, I've received care from some organizations and cannot compare the care and attention I receive at Temple to anywhere else."}
{"input": "Cupcakes are amazing and I love that they have a gluten free option! Anytime I need cupcakes I will order through here. The staff was so friendly and patient with my questions."}
{"input": "Great breakfast! Service was wonderful and met one of the \"chicks\". She was delightful to talk to and hear about the restaurant. I had a buckwheat crepe with crab, shrimp and veggies. Topped with an egg! Definitely see the Romanian influence. My wife had French toast and loved it."}
{"input": "So the atmosphere isn't that great. Kind of like a cafeteria that plays TMZ. I'm a vegetarian so there isn't much for me here. Which should have been obvious due to the \"7 course beef\" offering. I got the lemongrass tofu which was ok....I won't be returning to this place."}
{"input": "They should have a frequent buyers card because we spend a fortune here. When we are in Italy we eat gelato every day and Frost Gelato is very close in taste and texture. I would like to see some new exotic flavors but my favorites are sea salt caramel, stratchitella, mint chocolate chip, black cherry and at Christmas, peppermint! Love the peppermint.  And of course coconut. Yum \nThey do a great job with service, presentation and of course taste."}
{"input": "Great local brunch spot that seems to be more popular among the neighborhood folk than the tourist crowds.  I would certainly frequent this restaurant if I lived in the area.  The setting is very low-key, the service a little on the slow side, but the food was outstanding -- certainly the shrimp and grits, and the banana's foster french toast.  I really enjoyed the combination juice -- thick, fresh and flavorful and definitely not from concentrate.\n\nThis was a gem from the lonely planet guide that lived up to expectations.\n\nCash only."}
{"input": "Best breakfast sandwich I've ever had!  The Mrs. says their chicken is waffles are top notch too"}
{"input": "This place is great! We happened upon it accidentally on a Saturday morning but will definitely be back. Lots of outdoor seating, nice brunch menu, excellent Bloody Mary bar !! Friendly staff too. We had hummus and a bomb diggity kale salad. I'm a vegetarian so only a few options for brunch but they seem very accommodating.  We will be back!"}
{"input": "Simple, classic diner food. Delicious with a colorful clientele. Very busy Saturday and Sunday, open until 2pm, and CASH ONLY. Perfect turkey clubs, fresh burgers, and outstanding breakfast. I go once a day (though i often forget to check in!) Be nice to the waitstaff, they're the best around!"}
{"input": "I've been a fan of this place for a long time! Their hazelnut cake is awesome, as are many of their other cakes. I was 'sent' there years ago by recommendation for this signature cake and it more than lived up to it's reputation.\n\nTheir butter cookies are awesome -  absolutely love them. I frequently stop in to get cookie gifts to give to family and friends for special occasions - always a huge hit!\n\nI think their prices are right in line with their products. They are always consistently great.\n\nThe people that work there are wonderful - friendly and helpful!"}
{"input": "I stopped in the evening of St. Patty's just to check this place out & see what they have to offer.  A \"Whiskey Bar\" it is!  A nice wooden bar to your left upon walking in, with small tables dispersed around the perimeter of the restaurant.   They offer a solid selection of whiskey & bourbon at reasonable prices.  The bar staff was very knowledgeable and will help you make a decision if your not a connoisseur. \n  I toyed with the idea of going with a whiskey flight but I was tight on time.  My experience was great, and I look forward to going back here to explore their food options."}
{"input": "Fiorello's is awesome! My daughter's graduation was this past Saturday 5/31 and we were looking for something in west chester for lunch after the graduation with easy parking and great food.  we had 16 people and we all had GREAT meals. the service was outstanding and the ambiance was perfect - casual but very, very nice. I can't say enough about what a great experience we had."}
{"input": "Apartment is falling apart there is no insulation they don't repair anything. You can never get in touch with anyone the amenities are non existent there is no gate the pool is closed. The forced trash service sucks. Insects get in all the broken windows. They do anything to get you to move in and NOTHING to fix anything. You can hear your neighbors pee and everything else! Everyone has the same complaints it's crazy. We are trying to buy a house as soon as we find one we are out of here it's ridiculous. See pictures! Don't move here it's not worth it."}
{"input": "We originally came to eat at Pancake Pantry but it was raining cats and dogs. We didn't want to wait on the 2 hour line for just pancakes. So we looked around and noticed Jackson's. At this point, it was wet and cold and we didn't really care that much where we got a meal. \n\nFortunately, it was a good choice. We got seated right away and was quickly served a cup of Joe. At the time they were serving both breakfast and lunch menus. We all ordered breakfast, but the lunch dishes coming out of the kitchen looked mighty tasty too. I'm not sure if we were just glad to have food but overall the omelets and french toast were very good. Although, the hash browns is not what I consider to be hash browns. They were more like potato cubes."}
{"input": "The good: plush beds, huge flat screen tv, nice toiletries and great location. Very nice staff.\n\nThe bad: The hotel was under renovation, so there was construction outside and tarps making a nice courtyard look like a junkyard. We got stuck in the 3rd world country wing ( i think bc we got a cheap rate) where the air system was loud and obnoxious, and the wifi was broken. We had to take an elevator then a stair case to our room. The breakfast everyone raves about is quite mediocre compared to a spread places like the Intercontinental and other upscale hotels put together."}
{"input": "Had the best wings I've ever tasted! Not overly sauced and the skin is crispy. The tacos were just as good, but sadly they no longer offer the combo (one of each kind of taco, chicken, beef, and pork). We spoke with the manager (I'm assuming) several times. She made it a priority to speak with all of the customers. The food here is definitely too notch. My only criticism is that our food was slow coming out. Our server was nice enough to inform us that an appetizer was not going to be ready until near when our entrees would be so we just cancelled it. Overall a great experience and worth the try. \nCame back again and got the Fries and Wings and they came right out! Love the people and love the food."}
{"input": "Their mojo chicken sandwich is the best! It's an intimate restaurant with a hint of carribean and spanish flair. It has a laid back atmosphere and great service. The food is affordable and the staff are super friendly."}
{"input": "This has been an awful experience. We walked in around 1:30 pm and we waited for our drinks for 40 minutes and had to remind the waiter three times. Half of our table received their meals while the other half had to wait an extra 20 minutes. There were two tables here and a few at the bar, not busy at all. The table behind us walked out due to the awful service, and I'm currently wondering why I didn't. never going back"}
{"input": "After reading a lot of positive reviews, we were really excited to try this place. We were extremely disappointed in the food. I'm going to give the place the benefit of the doubt that it is not always like this as we came in at 10 PM, but if you cannot offer quality food at that hour then don't have your kitchen open. \nAll of our food came out within 5 to 10 minutes of ordering which leads me to believe it was not made fresh. The Caesar salad was room temperature and overdressed. The hush puppies were flavorless, and the chicken wings (3 full wings is a serving) were undercooked and barely warm. The only redeeming food item was the chicken and biscuits, which had a nice flavor profile- the biscuit was again, cold in spots. \n\nOn the positive side the place has a nice hip atmosphere and the service is friendly. \n\nUnfortunately, the food was so sub par we would not consider dining here again."}
{"input": "West Ave. Grill- Its a happy place in Jenkintown with a lot of locals eating outside under umbrellas with their dogs at their feet and kids on their lap.  Inside their is a large and small area with a bar to eat and look past the parking lot to nicer part of Jenkintown town square.  The wait staff is always nice and the owner is often around to talk to.  Free dum dum lolly pops at the counter as you walk out and news papers to read if you are eating alone or want to check in on the Phillies.\nFood- always good. Great pancakes that are fluffy and crispy on the edges.  Kansas City  is a great breakfast too- for the most part great.\nBig salads could have more Stuff in them- more of the things that are supposed to be there- as described etc.  But a complaint is readily heard and they always try to make you happy.  It's Nice- try it."}
{"input": "We stumbled upon Three Muses during our first few hours exploring Frenchmen Street. We put our names in for a table and had a long wait. But who cares! There's plenty to entertain you in the area while you wait. \n\nA late dinner at Three Muses was the perfect way to start our weekend in New Orleans: great food, local beers, wonderful live music, and friendly service. My group of four shared a bunch of tapas including: seared scallops, bacon wrapped dates, lamb sliders, swiss chard fritters (AMAZING), mac n' cheese, and feta fries. Almost everything we tried was great and we stayed for hours, listening to the music and ordering more tapas as the night went on. Definitely a gem on Frenchmen!"}
{"input": "Wow! What a spot! So neat. There's a store in the front if you're carrying out, or there's a huge backyard with a band if you're drinking there! There are small apps to purchase like cheese and meat, if you wish. There's also a small bar upstairs if you want an even more chill atmosphere. If you're starting to feel tipsy, there are water bins throughout the area so you can stay hydrated."}
{"input": "The French woman who owns the place ruined the experience for me.  She doesn't seem to have any respect for her stylists or staff.  Her concern was that halfway through my haircut, there was hair on the floor.  She whispered to my stylist to leave me and next thing I know my stylist is coming back with a broom to sweep up the hair. Who does that??  I have short hair, and not much of it so it looked like a really pissy move.  I felt intruded on, and such empathy for my stylist who, by the way, was the ultimate professional and gave me the best hair ever!  I don't patronize a salon, I faithfully follow a talented stylist.  Flamboyant untalented French lady ruins it for me every time.  Hoping my favorite stylist moves to another salon soon!"}
{"input": "I concur with user Lou D. I do not like that they removed some of the tables. While I've not had much of what was offered from those, it is cause for concern. If they remove two tables, who is to say they won't remove more food options down the line?\n\nWith that being said, for $8 lunch buffet, one cannot go wrong. The sushi is not exactly \"Morimoto\"-esque, obviously. However, combined with all the other, wide variety of Asian cuisine, it's more than worth it. The overall sampling of food is decent-to-good for that 8 bucks. \n\nIf you're feeling particularly hungry with a wide open stomach, I'd recommend this place, for sure!"}
{"input": "I don't get the chance to visit this location often, but the time I was there went great. Prompt service, good tasting drinks."}
{"input": "Rude staff that stands around and does nothing besides stand in a circle and talk to each other. Doesn't bother to greet you when you walk in the door. Facility is old and not well cared for."}
{"input": "I've been here many times and I always come back. Great location! The service however is touch and go. It's also noteworthy that I didn't see any African American servers or bartenders. The food is good, but not great, and I haven't seen a mouse the last couple times I've been. Enjoy!"}
{"input": "The service was great and they got us to a table really quick. The flavors were good and tasty. Perfect for a lunch date."}
{"input": "Our stay here was fantastic. The rooms are very modern and spacious. The staff was very friendly in helping us with any questions. The rooms are very quiet and the beds are extremely comfortable."}
{"input": "Normally I would rate this Fulin's a little higher but the experience that I just went through pulled them way down. It wasn't because of the food (which I would rate about 3 1/2 - 4) but due to the personnel working at this place I pulled the rating down to a 2. I had read similar reviews before I visited this restaurant that experienced the safe sort of negative behavior. The bartender (both of them) act as if they are the managers and really don't focus on the customers. The employees get together and openly discuss their issues right in from of the customers instead of working. I don't see how management makes money on a staff that doesn't seem to be concerned about how their customers feel."}
{"input": "Cute lil spot on Germantown Ave. I came in craving something sweet and they did not disappoint. There was an array of cookies and bars to choose from, if my memory serves me right. Behind the display of goodies there was a table with clear plastic cups filled with yumminess, labeled \"cake scrapple\" I was intrigued. They were different kinds of cakes and icings, most likely left over from a bake. There were about 5 different flavors to choose from and I went with my favorite Red Velvet with cream cheese frosting. I also ended up with an M&M cookie, my other fave! It was a nice day so I sat outside on their bench and had a couple bites of goodness! The cookie was great, soft & chewy with those hard candies for texture. The cake was also delicious and moist!"}
{"input": "Amazing place for lassi and chaat. The chaat is elegantly presented and tastes like traditional Karachi chaat. However, the chaat isn't as nearly as good as the lassi. It is soft and creamy and sweetened beautifully. Will be coming back for sure next time I'm in the area."}
{"input": "My dad and I stopped in on the way back to the hotel because we wanted a 2nd drink after being disappointed with our first at another place. We ordered the hand grenades rather than pore over the menu. There was a band playing so we decided to sit for a bit Holy cow on those drinks!! They were $9 each (with souvenir cup) and we were really feeling it towards the end of the drink. It was during the day and we were enjoying the nice weather and band playing. This place was on the corner of Bourbon, close to Jackson Square and there was lots of open air coming through. We were singing along with the band which is an indication of how good that drink made us feel, lol. We had a lot of fun, good atmosphere in that bar."}
{"input": "Please be aware if you have a pet and are staying here they only allow you on the 3rd floor, the room is the size of a closet, and has a view of a wall. The bed just had a sheet over the mattress. For the amount I paid to stay it was a bit upsetting. The staff is very nice and moved my wife to another room but I had to stay in this room with the dog."}
{"input": "Amazingly good. The only place I've found paneer butter masala locally and it's SO good. Can't wait to try some of the other vegetarian selections!"}
{"input": "The food was good. Price was Ok. We were instructed to sit on a table next to the window which I really liked. The waitress was not very smiley and kind but she managed well enough. \nOverall, Its recommend for a good coffee and brunch! :)"}
{"input": "Ice cream martinis. What more could one want one a Friday night? Their food is good as well. Portions are filling and taste good. The ambience of the place is what really sold it for me. It's a great hangout."}
{"input": "I definitely preferred the pizza from nabruzzi, but Enzo's is still a good take out option in the area. I recommend their meatball sub and garlic knots. The meatballs taste homemade and of good quality. We'll continue to get food from here, but I do wish they would still offer the pizzas they had when it was nabruzzi"}
{"input": "This place was my favorite brunch place in New Orleans. I didn't mind taking the walk down Magazine Street just to eat here. Stopped by the shop twice during my one week vacation in New Orleans. \n\nI loved the concept of having different specialty donuts and sliders on each day of the week. And the sliders were delicious with every bite that I took! A must go to place when you stay in New Orleans."}
{"input": "Incredible food! The owner is so hospitable and ales everyone feel like family. Had the lamb gyro and the flavor was over the top! Loved their tzatziki sauce was delicious! Loved their Greek Salad as well, definitely recommend to anyone wanting authentic Greek food!"}
{"input": "Well, I can't lie, they were definitely good--I got the Bacon & Eggs (3 pancakes, bacon, and 3 eggs) which were great. My bf got the Caribbean Pancakes (pancakes w/ bananas, walnuts, coconut shavings, and powered sugar) & side of Grits. The grits were my FAVORITE--all super buttery--and I don't even like grits! While everything was good, and I would surely go back and try other things, I think a lot of it is hype, it's good, but people make it sound glorious and orgasmic. I've had better pancakes that just melted in my mouth (literally) elsewhere. But for the overall experience, I'd say it's good, but it's not the hype people make it to be, but I'd def go back\n\nP.S. We saw Reese Witherspoon there"}
{"input": "So yummy! Spicy tofu banh mi rocks, along with the rainbow spring rolls. Service can be a little slow, but it's worth it for the quality of food.\n\nTheir pho is also always good. ALWAYS."}
{"input": "Great atmosphere. And great burger the Fondu burger was rediculous. The servers aren't bad to look at either."}
{"input": "There's lots of contention about the Euro-snooty attitude of La Colombe's baristas.  They may have a point.  However, since I lived in Philly and now in DC, La Colombe's Niza roast has been about the only roast that takes me back to my childhood.\n\nWhenever I come back to Philly to visit my BF, which is quite often, I end up buying a 5-lb bag of Niza roast, in beans, to use with my trusty Gaggia. I do my own grinding and the coffee is absolutely delicious.\n\nHaving said that, the baristas should attend the Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People, as well as read the old I'm OK You're OK trusty book.  Their attitude does need improvement fersure."}
{"input": "Very rich super sweet ice cream created with any combination of toppings crushed in with fanfare by your server. I found it to be a little to rich as far as sweet and fat for my blood as my stomach agreed for the ache and nausea that occurred later. If your in the are its a good place for high end ice cream. There is a yogurt shop and Baskin Robbins in the area also."}
{"input": "This is my favorite spot to go before Cardinal ball games. Good food and good people!!!"}
{"input": "this is a great fabrics store...soooo much to choose from especially in the upholstery/decorating fabrics.\n\ni went in on vacation when i was visiting my family and found the best kitschy cowgirl fabric i have ever seen! it is definitely a go to place for beautiful fabrics but it is also nice to know that the southwestern fabrics they have also have some humor! \n\nthe family who runs it has been there since i was a kid so it is a great Tucson business!  The special offer i was able to use made the price even better! although not all the staff was aware of it they honored it as a true/honest business should!\n\nI will definitely be back as soon as I am back in town!"}
{"input": "Yes, yes, yes, yesss! Dmitri's is a wonderful BYOB with delicious, fresh, flavorful food. The QV space is tiny, but not cramped. You get a great amount for the price and I have never had a bad dish. Only downside is I have experienced a \"3\" level service on a few occasions, but the food keeps me coming back."}
{"input": "Nice lounge, cool atmosphere great lighting.  Beds are low and you may bang you legs up, great location."}
{"input": "I'm all about the bargains, but, can someone PLEASE clean the door handles???  I walked in at 10am this morning-the door handles on their double entrance doors and the door frame area around the handles were FILTHY!!!   I couldn't wait to clean my hands after being in this store-and it should NOT be that way. \n\nNo excuse, all the staff were standing around talking.  \n\nPeople, take some pride, huh, what about it???"}
{"input": "I've eaten at this location countless times and it is always perfect! Awesome food, awesome beer, awesome service, what more can you ask for?\n\nParticularly love the outdoor seating."}
{"input": "My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in town. They are always quick with orders and they are cheap. I have never had something I don't like from them. Their pho is better than any other place in town. I normally get a #10 or #50."}
{"input": "Should have listened to other reviews--we were kind of disappointed.  The layout of the restaurant is interesting in that it's made to look sort of like the inside of a chicken coop (made for people).  However, the food was overpriced and underwhelming.  We ate from the Sunday brunch menu--only decent value on the menu is the chicken strips and fries.  My wife ordered the seasonal salad, which was comically small and was way short on the actual lettuce (and not cheap either).  Chicken was good, but nothing better than Raising Canes in my opinion.  Service and food seemed on the slow side, especially with the small crowd."}
{"input": "Ate here on memorial day for breakfast. TERRIBLE! The bacon was the only thing edible. My lady had their \"potatoes\" and half a scrambled egg. Literally that small of a portion. The \"potatoes\" were gross, she even had me try them to confirm it wasn't her, yuck! My biscuits and gravy was the smallest portion/price I've ever experienced and i think the lid may have come off the salt when they were making the gravy, ugh! Bacon bloody Mary was good as was the bacon. They didn't have any forks so we had to use plastic, absurd for a business that charges for the name on the front. Customer service was border line non existent and the place wasn't even half full, I'd hate to see what happens to all these kids when they're at capacity.  Don't waste your time unless you're just out for a drink and a piece of bacon."}
{"input": "\"I'll get to you when I can\"-- Not the best way to greet paying customers. If it was actually busy I could understand the server's frustration but it was dead in there at 4 in the afternoon. Pouring beers can't be that stressful... Thankfully the young lady at the counter was helpful."}
{"input": "It was crowded and a small place but they had AMAZING burgers! The food was wonderful! Best burger I had by far! The drinks were good too!"}
{"input": "I can't really complain about my stay here. We were in Philly for 5 days and spent the last 3 nights at the Windsor. The room we got was bigger than our apartment in NYC (we upgraded, but i think they accidently gave us a HUGE room, that or the price is just AMAZING).. the king size bed was amazing. We had a balcony, living room, and full kitchen. I wish it would have been a bit more clean and updated. That fitness room is kind of a joke, but i just used the treadmill. The staff seemed friendly and took care of everything we could have asked for. If we come to Philly next summer we will probably stay here again."}
{"input": "If you like Mac n Cheese you will love this place. It's located on a very busy street filled with shops and other surrounding restaurants. Mac Mart is very small so not ideal for crowds. Not a lot of seating but based on there niche it's probably expected. \nThey have a variety of options on how you want your dish. I went with the Jalapeño Poppers. Service was quick and my food was ready in no time. They do serve you your dish in a Rubbermaid type of container which doesn't look like much but it was very filling. The dish it's self was great, I loved it!! I would highly recommend this place for all  Mac n Cheese lovers.\nI also like how they encourage you to keep the container b/c it's reusable and encourages recycling.\nOverall service was good"}
{"input": "It is a decent place. The food is great and the service is nice. I was there twice during my stay in town. I ordered their daily specials and was very satisfied."}
{"input": "We just had dinner at this Greek restaurant that is A 10 minute walk from the art museum. We were seated in the back room that was really cute and the waitress was nice. I ordered the lamb shrank with vegetables and my husband roasted lamb with vegetables and potatoes. The lamb shank was very good, the roasted lamb was good. The mixed vegetables was a gray mash of peas cabbage and carrots cooked to death and they were just warm not hot. They tasted OK but look terrible. The waitress said that was how the vegetables were prepared. The food seem to be just dump together on a plate and didn't look very appetizing. We also split a Greek salad which for some strange reason didn't have any greens but the cucumbers and tomatoes and olives were tasty. I will try this place again and order something different."}
{"input": "Do not ever go to a Fried Chicken Joint and complain about the side dishes, especially the standard factory cans of commercial puddings ? lol. who does that ? The Pinellas Park eatery is a place to GORGE yourself on all the Chicken you can eat ! Do it and do it well."}
{"input": "I make it my goal to try every taco place in a new city I've moved to. Second best taco place in Tucson. Comparable to LA tacos which I love. These are true street tacos and for a great price. \nEasily one of my favorite places to go."}
{"input": "Can't go wrong with Frady's po-boys.  Then hang out on the corner with a beer."}
{"input": "Really surprised about the negative reviews. A lot of them seem to be for the buffet, which I can't comment on. I ordered from the regular menu and rather enjoyed it. The staff were attentive and I think we met the owner one night who gave us some rental advice and other local goss. Lovely guy! \n\nAdmittedly, my fave thing about this joint is the decor. It's got so much going on! Lots of ornaments and decorations. You can sit on the floor at a little table on soft cushions. There's always Bollywood movies on and it's in a fabulous location on State Street. \n\nI reckon if you order of the main menu and you're as easily impressed by pretty, shiny decor as I am - you'll give it at least 3-4 stars."}
{"input": "Nice merchandising in the lobby.  Fantastic breakfast for the morning after brewery crawls. \n\nThey had trouble with the taps when we went, but made up for it in heavy pours. \n\nThe beer selection makes flights a little hard to choose from, so go more than once to work through the brews. You won't be sorry."}
{"input": "Very lovely hotel. Very updated. I stayed on the 4th floor and I did not request a suite but it filled out to be like one. It had 2 tv's (one for the living room part & bedroom). I adore the separation units. The bedroom has very nice leather headboards & lights above to add flare. \n\nThe bathroom is spacious. Roomy. \nI would definitely stay here again. I've never stayed in a holiday inn that was Sooo nice. And it is not far from burbon at all. 10mins tops with no traffic."}
{"input": "I love craft beers. I decided to make a stop and try Deviate Brewing. This is the best local craft beer I've had since moving to Indy. I tried the Two IPAs, blood orange sour, Belgian peach, and the gingerbread stout. All of them were delicious. Prices are reasonable. Staff are friendly. Another plus dogs are allowed. I will definitely come back."}
{"input": "The best comedy club in Santa Barbara. Okay the only club. But still a great club to come watch a show. Don Friesen was the headliner the day we went and I have seen him several times before at various clubs but never gets old. Super talented and super funny and super impressive since Don is. Totally clean comedian. He has actually won the San Francisco comedy festival twice -the only person to ever have done that with two different hours of material. No I don't work for Don but he always impresses me. The acts from start to finish were terrific. And the food is great which says something bc a lot of comedy clubs just do crappy bar food: i had ahi and oysters which I was hesitating about but had no reason to. The food was greatl. The comedy was great.the staff was great. Run don't walk here."}
{"input": "Cracked iphone screen. I was an idiot and called my insurance plan and within a blink of an eye I had a brand new iphone for $170. Sent that back and took it here. Got the screen fixed in 5 min and had a case for $150. The guy was knowledgeable, helpful, and didnt try to upsale me on anything."}
{"input": "Yum.  Consistently excellent. The daily menu items are a great value and fun. I could eat here every day. But.....I could not fit through the revolving door....."}
{"input": "Our wedding at Winters Creek Lodge was absolutely fantastic. Judit was a rockstar. She got us organized, and was very flexible and helpful to allow us to fulfill our vision. Our guests have raved and raved about the views and what an amazing venue it was. Our photos are breath-taking. Regarding the food, you will hear that they do not offer tastings, but do not worry: we can confirm that it was absolutely delicious. Their pricing is also very competitive for the area.\n\nWe strongly recommend working with Judit at the Winters Creek Lodge."}
{"input": "I was very excited to try this place. Went at 2:30 on Saturday. They are supposed to open at 2. After ordering, my friend and I were told that \"nothing was prepped\" and it would be 25 more minutes. We said we did not mind waiting. We waited an hour but nothing was ever \"prepped\", except Mac and cheese or charcuterie. We had the charcuterie and left. There was no attempt to make things right or explain. Very strange experience and poor/ no customer service. The waiter was nice though, and I felt sorry for him."}
{"input": "Tried to go there the other night but got stopped at the door for wearing boots even though I've been there a dozen times with boots on and other people were going in and out wearing boots."}
{"input": "Really friendly staff .There's a white skinny  guy that always seems in a bad mood and is not friendly but other then that when hes not there the rest of the people are great .\nTheir biscuits and gravy are off the hook. I would definitely recommend this place to everybody ."}
{"input": "The attendant was extremely helpful,  we were looking for a fairly uncommon liquor and they had it. Pretty good selection, friendly staff."}
{"input": "Great environment, wonderful owners and great food. I tried the tortilla española and ate it \"cuban style\" where you put portions of the tortilla on Cuban bread with a layer of mayo. Delicious!"}
{"input": "Had the lengua burrito. It was non greesy and plated neatly. Simple food that was easy on the wallet. Think I will try the flan next time"}
{"input": "The service is going to be slooooww. And the food okay. Do not come here if you are with a group more than 4 if you have to be anywhere because it will be slow. \n\nI came with a group and we were the only ones around and the service was still a mess. There were multiple servers around who watched one server struggle. I felt bad for her. She was making drinks, serving, and running food."}
{"input": "The environment/ambiance were great but the host/ seating situation was awful! We had to explain to the hostess how to split our group and offered to split into groups or 2 to speed it up. The hostess said it wasn't necessary then sat 3 two tops that arrived much later than us. Thankfully after our hour wait and having our server Montez gave great service. The portion for some of the dishes were small for the price but I'd stop by again For a weekday brunch"}
{"input": "I previously reviewed this place because its my go to for cheesesteaks and such .... .... I still consider this place my favorte go to for such things and omg french fries yumm ... However i decided to try the pizza but the pizza was not my cup of tea .... It was pizza looked like chuck e cheese pizza ... WHATEVER IM PREGNANT .  it was bad !!! tasted like beer the cheese was rubbery ..... And it wasint the dough that tasted like beer it was sauce or cheese ugh .... This is 100% my go to for cheese steaks and chicken cheesesteaks and again the YUMMY fries ..... The chicken fingers are good too ... My stay away from on the pizza front it sucks too because they are always timely and nice !!"}
{"input": "I absolutely love this place! I go there about 5 times a month and ate almost everything on the menu at least once. My favorite is the B-nice cheesesteak (I get the wrap). My favorite part about this place is that they offer all their sandwiches as wraps. I wish they would offer wheat wraps but i'm just getting a little picky.  Their smoked wings, ribs, and quesadillas, burgers and fries are all awesome. Margarita pitchers are strong and fairly priced during happy hour. Everything I order here is amazing."}
{"input": "We tried this restaurant on the recommendation of some friends and we were not disappointed! We have eaten at quite a number of Thai restaurants over the past 40 years in various parts of the world and some were great and some not so great. Orchid Thai rates high on the list of really good ones. My standard for checking out a new Thai restaurants Is Pad Tai. The dish was great! My wife and our friends each had something different and everyone enjoyed their meals.\nTry this restaurant and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"input": "Great place to hang out!  I saw 10 people that I knew in there at the same time this morning!   Check it out!"}
{"input": "5 years into traveling for a career, I've never HAD to write a yelp review. \nWhile in town performing for a the week at The Playhouse on Rodney Square, our company chose to stay at this Hilton. After stepping outside to make a phone call and search for a bar of wifi, my colleague was locked out of her room (with all of her belongings inside.) \nAfter waking me at 2:30AM the front desk told me they are \"sorry I don't have the money in my account.\" This required me to show them my BANK ACCOUNT. It is then clear that I have the money and have ALREADY been charged. The man at the front desk, Laison, told me he is \"just the messenger\"... and then I was told by a random employee dressed in her street clothes (named Kamari) that they were going to call the COPS on me. What?? Great night, thanks Hilton -glad I'm an honors member."}
{"input": "My wife and I walked by here a few times and liked the music so we thought we would give it a try.  The bartender was snooty, first chastising us for having a hurricane cup in our possession  (this is a block off of Burbon street, and she's going about judging people).  Then she proceeds with two failed attempts at a PIMMS cup for my wife, does not offer me a glass for my beer....just plain failed at bar tending 101.  \n\nHope you have better luck.  Keep your pinky in the air (or in my case maybe a different finger, haha)"}
{"input": "Went here today with my little one for a pop in and play day.\nThings to know: This place can be super packed, so if you plan on going I would buy an advance ticket to the pop in day on their website.\nAlso go to Miracle Mile and then take the frontage road down towards Prince because it is between Miracle Mile and Prince.\n\nPositive:  it is a great place to take the kids on a hot day, my daughter loves it, parents can play with the kids, it is different and seems cleaner than a mall play place or fast food play place\n\nNegative: it can get super busy and parents seems to have no problem not watching their kids especially older kids which means the littler kids will get trampled (my daughter was pushed down at least 3 times within an hour today)"}
{"input": "Susanna Foo is a great upscale Chinese restaurant; this ain't your grandparent's chinese food.  The interior is a subdued contemporary design,  and great for romantic dinners or a family outing.  The food and service are excellent, many of the classic American-Chinese dishes but with superior ingredients.  There is also a great deal of innovative dishes (and cocktails) as well.  \n\nIf you want to have amazing Chinese cuisine, definitely check out Susanna Foo's."}
{"input": "It just wasn't fun, or informative, or interesting, and the water portion-which is the thing that makes it different from other tours-is like 7min. and super boring. The guide wasn't great either, but for us at least they gave out the quakers at the end of the tour, being on the boat for 90 seconds with those things made the tour seem hours longer. There must be a better way to spend your money. I've been on duck tours in other cities and this one is the worst."}
{"input": "This is my new favorite restaurant in NOLA.  I've been several times and can't stop raving  about it.  I have a huge crush on their curried goat.  The goat is tender and well seasoned.  If you're lucky and they are serving them get the fried squash blossoms stuff with cheese.  Perfect crunch...melts in your mouth.  You won't want to share this dish trust me.  Rarely do I ever order desert but the meal is always so I good I just can't pass it up.  It's not a huge place which I prefer.  The decor is well thought out, relaxed sophisticated.  I am thrilled Chef Nina Compton chose New Orleans to open her restaurant... or did New Orleans choose her?!"}
{"input": "Dmitri's is the best Greek food in town. If you're a seafood lover, go for the shrimp pil pil and the octopus. The grilled lamb and chicken entrees are the only non seafood items, but they're fantastic. Make sure to get the hummus - it comes with unlimited warm grilled pita and baguette.\n\nAlso - BYOB! And they don't take reservations. Kitchen closes at 10 so make sure to get there by 9:30."}
{"input": "Delicious. So happy I Yelped for a restaurant closer to home and stumbled upon this. It's small and pleasant inside with some decent hip hop setting the mood. The menu is small, but packed a punch. We ordered the Duck Fries, which were heaven. Fries smothered in smoked gouda,  shredded duck, and scallions. For 8 bucks came a pretty large bowl that I couldn't stop picking at. I ordered one of the specials, the scallop and foie gras  tacos...wow...so good (then I read the origin of foie gras and hated myself, but aside that...). The person I was with ordered the pork roll burger, which I tried of course. It was incredibly juicy and cooked perfect. I will definitely come back here. Definitely."}
{"input": "I tried their decaf latte which was tasty, foamy, so good and light that I didn't need to add sugar.\nThe store is cute and the baristas very friendly. It has a private parking lot but it's always packed.\nI definitely come back on my next visit to Santa Barbara."}
{"input": "Stunning hotel, great service and a fantastic brunch!! The best beignets in Nola! The hotel is old and can get a little loud if you're on the street side however so take that into account when booking. The carousel bar is great but can get crowded if they have live music. Go early for a pre dinner drink!"}
{"input": "Yelp, please let us start giving zero stars!  Terrible.  No concept of service or how to shift employees to help high volume times.   Almost no one dropping off cars at 6:30 pm to take flights and a line going out the door to pick up cars yet there are still employees just walking around out side while 2 ladies are slammed.  It has  already been 40 minutes and we will be in line another 45 minutes at this pace.\n\nof course...the self service kiosks are broken too.  \n\nThis place is a train wreck."}
{"input": "Update, it's been well over a month now, but multiple attempts to get It Can Fit to come fix/replace the couch have failed. They haven't even bothered responding to my review and even if I get them on the phone, I can't rely on them to stick to any appointments they offer.\n\nIf you are looking to move soon, my advice would be to find a more professional mover way ahead of time. These guys (ICF) were available last minute and I decided to bite with the lower rate that they quoted, but do yourself a favor and plan your move ahead of time and don't think too much about any slight price difference. It would be worth it to go with a professional moving company."}
{"input": "This place is a hoot (if you've had one of their jumbo margaritas).\n\nI'd never heard of Iggy's and expected the cliche strip mall Mexican joint. And as for the food, that's pretty much what I got (bean burritos are vegetarian, by the way). \n\nThe atmosphere was just plain bizarre! The space is very open (aside from the bar, which is behind an awkward half-wall), and there's a stage at the front of the main dining area. The night I visited was apparently karaoke night. No one was singing at the time of my departure, but there was definitely a rowdier bunch gearing up. This was on a Wednesday night, so I can't imagine what it's like on weekends.\n\nService was pretty slow, though our server was friendly enough. And the happy hour special of a jumbo margarita for $5.99 was thoroughly enjoyed."}
{"input": "These gentlemen saved me!  I had bizarre issues with my car driving from the Bay to Reno. I was treated daily and not price gouged like other quotes I got that weekend."}
{"input": "I enjoy Chick-fil-a's spicy chicken sandwich and waffle fries. The quality of the food at this location is no different relative to other stores in the chain although it may have a smaller menu. During lunch hours the long can get very long and it feels like they rush you away at the counter without much time to even put your money or credit card away. On the bright side because they are so busy the wait isn't too long after you order. Its better to get this to go and eat in your car unless you have a table already since seating can be hard to come by."}
{"input": "The pizza is subpar at best. The owner was a douche bag to my brother. We asked for a box and an employee told us his boxes are trash and pizza is quality. Lol what?! Well let me tell you. Size doesn't matter. His pizza is trash. Like his 50 cent boxes. FIGHT THE URGE AND GO ELSEWHERE!\nWith love,\nThe ducci duo!"}
{"input": "Very knowledgeable staff can help you do just about anything from buying 35mm film to reframing historical photographs to picking out the best camera for you!"}
{"input": "My favorite restaurant!  Pasquale's food is better than Italy.  I know, he helped spur a trip with friends to Italy in 2012!  Warm family, delicious food, a fabulous combination!"}
{"input": "this is probably one of the friendliest businesses I've ever been to all the mechanics and Personnel are very friendly and helpful willing to allow the way to make sure you have a pleasant visit the attendance out front take very well care of you with washing your windshields and letting you know if your inspections are due and very honest group of people at this place"}
{"input": "Went here on a Saturday night was seated right away I was shocked. Our server was amazing even helped pick out some drinks. I would suggest the white ale! Delicious! The food was amazing the best sushi I have had! I would drive 45 mins again to come back!"}
{"input": "We found Benny based on his yelp reviews.  We were in town to catch a cruise and after a red eye from California figured we could both use \"tuneups\".  The appointments were easy to make via email/text and I have to say he is an absolute gem of a find.  We scheduled a follow up appointment on our way out of town.   The best way I'd describe his work would be intense neuromuscular.  Relaxing it was not (although my boyfriend had a more relaxing experience) he did some intense release on my quads, hamstrings and glutes that did an amazing job on my sciatica.  Thank you Benny we will be back anytime we are in town.  I can't recommend this amazing healer highly enough!"}
{"input": "I am an Indian, I know what Indian food tastes. This place just sucks - the food, the service, you name it, way too pricey and not worth. The owner and waiter seem to be providing special services to special guests (those who don't know much about Indian food), others they just ignore.\n\nWe walked in and were asked to sit on a table. No one came to attend us for 10-15 mins. I had to go and and grab the menu myself. Still no one attended us, no one even came by to ask for water/drinks. We went to the person and placed our order. The order came by after 15 mins - and all he brought was curries - no bread, no water, no cutlery. He took another 5-7 mins to get them. The food was tasteless and watery - did not even get salt when asked for.\n\nSTAY AWAY! DON'T FALL FOR THE AMBIENCE!"}
{"input": "Great customer service!!  Last pizza I got was good.  Another one on the way"}
{"input": "We belong to lifetime in another state and were visitingvisiting from Colorado to buy a potential second-home in the area. First Jen The front desk person was so nice and very helpful.   She speaks so highly of the club and all of the amenities that it offers.    I also met Joe the general manager what a terrific guy.     The club is much smaller than other lifetimes however very full service for those who want The next level and service.    The bathrooms are fantastic and for the men fully stocked with shavers, shaving cream and lotions.   You need absolutely no toiletries all provided.  Great location next to the mall.  Highly recommend."}
{"input": "I really liked this place.  I went with a coworker during beer week.  We came from their sister bar Farmer's Cabinet.  Both places are quite similar, but FC had an air of pretentiousness that Boilermaker didn't.  FC was also considerably more expensive for smaller portions whereas Boilermaker's beers and food were reasonably-priced.\n\nTheir beer week offerings featured over a dozen from their brewery, Cabinet Artisinal Brewhouse which are mainly sour and/or really interesting beers.  I absolutely loved everything I tried.  One of the two bartenders was very knowledgeable and all were helpful.  We ordered their hot dog plate which was 2 bacon-wrapped hot dogs with a mountain of fries for $9 which is a pretty good deal IMO.\n\nUnfortunately, I just read that the headbrewer is leaving Cabinet Artisinal Brewhouse.  Hopefully they can get another highly skilled brewer to continue pumping out unique brews (especially my beloved sours) as their beers were a big reason I'd go back to this place."}
{"input": "I made my Yelp account for the soul purpose of reviewing this place; I think that very much speaks to how I enjoyed the experience. It's exactly what you would expect from a local cafe/coffee shop and then some. The food and coffee were great and the atmosphere was very friendly and casual. The architecture of the dining room was very cool as well - it had a very Victorian feel, which I personally love. The service was a bit slow, but the barista was the only person working behind the counter and she was also very personable, so for that we can forgive her. When I go to a coffee shop I usually go to stay and relax, often reading or sketching. It is the perfect place for that, with both indoor and outdoor tables, a booth, and a counter. I also appreciated the dog-friendly policy but that's definitely a personal preference and isn't right for everyone. The location is also great, being situated in the French quarter. My only complaint is that I could only visit once on my trip to New Orleans."}
{"input": "We ended up here because we were staying across the street and were too hungry to really scope out anything that required much work. Ended up being pleasantly surprised. My husband got a shrimp po boy with fries and I had a buffalo chicken wrap with sweet potato fries that was the day special and they were both REALLY good. Or maybe we were just really hungry. The service was on the good side of average- our waitress was a little forgetful but funny and was at least trying.  And my drink had a plastic mermaid with it. And an umbrella. And it wasn't even a fruity chick drink, so it made me happy. Strange to find a surfing bar theme in downtown New Orleans, but they made it work!"}
{"input": "Had to wait until my third trip to NOLA to actually get in the door.  First two times I tried waiting in line, this time around we got smart and bought reserved seats so we could be on the benches. Well worth the extra $20 to not hassle with waiting in line for an hour. It goes toward the preservation of Jazz so it's a good cause...just splurge.\n\nThe show was fantastic.  True musicians and great personalities to boot. I can only imagine that this is what concerts were like 50 years ago. The band members were dapper, engaging and insanely talented.  It's in a tiny hole in the wall space that only holds maybe 200 people? So it's very intimate and nice to see the smiles on the faces of the musicians as they share their craft with you. This is a must do while in NOLA!"}
{"input": "This is one of the best experiences I have had in an Extended Stay America motel. The manager comped my room for a minor mishap and I stayed another night. There was a broken drawer in the nightstand and the shower curtain was hung too high, like a LOT of hotels I have been in, and that sent water all over the floor but the staff made up for all of that. I would recommend this motel again."}
{"input": "Oh hertz shuttle, never to be found.  There goes avis again.  Alamo and national.  Sadly I stay loyal because you actually provide service outside of missouri."}
{"input": "The food here is tasty - love the brisket and the cheese grits. BUT - we have had terrible luck with take out. Tried it three times, and an item was missing every time. A disappointing blemish on an otherwise fine restaurant."}
{"input": "I love the prices ! The chicken and waffles were good but not the best I've ever had. The service was nice and quick also."}
{"input": "When I am back in the Indy area, this place will be on my list of potential places to visit. It was packed on a Wednesday night at 7pm, which I actually saw as a good sign and the service and quality of the food definitely met my expectations. My expectations were lower based on the fact that it is part of a small restaurant group, but they were exceeded by the experience and ambiance. The salads are all good and the salmon was cooked really well. I guess I could even say that the portion was too big for me (which is rare for me!), but overall I left with no complaints and the bread was really good!"}
{"input": "Only giving one star because I'm required to give A star in order to leave a review. \n\nFirst, rude employees. We were never greeted, never acknowledged, while multiple employees came to the station in front of us and then walked away. No one even looked up at us. As we were about to walk out, someone finally stood there and looked at us. Not sure if she actually said anything, but we gave her our order anyway. \n\nFood quality was BAD! The pinto beans were cold. The brisket was not warm, but I wouldn't call them quite cold. I looked for their health score but didn't see it posted anywhere. Maybe the lack of one should have been a sign.\n\nYeah, we won't be back. Like ever. With so many other restaurants in this shopping center, there are too many good choice to settle for food and service this bad. Save yourself the trouble and go next door to Panera, or Fulins, or Longhorn. Heck, even go buy you a candy bar from Target before choosing to eat here. You'll be glad you did."}
{"input": "I COULD HAVE MADE A BETTER PIZZA AT HOME !! STAY AWAY !! THE WORST PIZZA I HAVE HAD IN THE AREA !! \n\nRather than just ramble without substantial factual basis to back it up, let me describe this pizza. The sauce was partially cold, spicy in a bad way, and tasted out of the can. The dough tasted liked it was picked up off the floor after it had been cleaned with 409. The toppings and cheese were equally disturbing. All this for a large pizza for a $40.00 tab. \n\nThe place needs to be shut down."}
{"input": "When dining out, my girlfriend and I enjoy a mix of great food tastes, a well-managed beer menu, engaging staff, eclectic ambiance, and a good value (and yes, we are ok with dropping $200 for a dinner for two.)\n\nOur visit to Aldine satisfied 2.5 of these five stars - great tastes and an eclectic ambiance.\n\nTheir beer list was ok. The service was sterile and perfunctory. And, dinner for two was $135 before tip. The $25-26 entries were delicious and reminded us of tapas - however, Aldine is not a tapas restaurant.\n\nWe probably won't be returning."}
{"input": "Maybe caught the staff on a bad day, but the people in the pharmacy were not friendly. Was told my prescription be ready in 15, when i showed up 20 minutes later they said it would be ready in a half hour. If your in a hurry dont bother filling up your prescription here. Might as well go next door to Walmart!"}
{"input": "This place has the best wings ever and the fries totally rock.  We frequent this place and the food is consistently good and the servers couldn't be more friendly or helpful.  We highly recommend it for a fun casual atmosphere with great food.\n\nSherri and Steve\nPhiladelphia"}
{"input": "The fried chicken is really good here. I know that sounds weird that a donut place has fried chicken but not to people that live in philly and know about federal donuts. The location in NoLibs is on a sketchy street with nothing else around it. The donuts are really good too but the fried chicken is the star here."}
{"input": "Dine-in gets 2 stars. Disappointing service & venue falls short. \n\nThe food was ok; so if you were to do take out, maybe this place would get 3 stars. \n\nI ordered the lamb kebab, which tasted ok; but it was very plain. No sauces, lettuce or anything - just meat."}
{"input": "I pull into Concord Carwash and order the Deluxe package. The attendent lets me know that I can get the Supreme on sale and spend LESS for an upgraded wash. Who does that? Yes, I am sold on Concord Carwash. And they do a fantastic job on interior cleaning. When I want to baby my car, I take it to Concord."}
{"input": "First time there and it was excellent!!! It feels like your are entering someone's home. The waiters there funny and nice. The food come out very quickly and it is phenomenal!!! Definitely will be going back to this place."}
{"input": "Ordered the small plate tortellini. It wasn't cooked and had a long brown hair mixed into the marinara sauce. I went back to return the food and was the gentleman behind the countered became argumentative and defensive.  He then begrudgingly gave me a refund and offered no other solution.  Too add to the already terrible experience, he sarcastically wished a 'nice day'."}
{"input": "Best steak house in Edmonton! Great fresh salads, pizza and steak. Service for the most part is good and the steaks are always cooked perfectly!\n\nThe Cesar salad is the best I've ever had!"}
{"input": "OMG! Is the night crew here slow and frankly not too bright. Took 1/2 hour in the drive thru to get a chocolate chip milk shake and they still made it wrong. Yikes!  Skip this location and hit cold stone creamery instead."}
{"input": "Big fan of District. They have such innovative donuts and I love seeing what they come up with next. I have yet to try a slider, but am just waiting for the time to come. The coffee is great and you can't go wrong with a classic iced coffee. I also tried their nitro cold brew (doesn't have ice), which was interesting. Not really sure what the deal with it was, but it was good. \n\nThey also have a great interior - a great design job at a restaurant really makes the place. They employees all also seem generally happy and are great servers."}
{"input": "Don't let the outside fool ya or even the initial impression when you walk in because they food here is really good! When ya walk in this place it's like stepping back into the 1950's.  It's kinda awesome.  Definitely a small-town, homey feel that serves good ole family cookin'.  They had a iceskates up on the wall and a Christmas tree in the corner.  How precious.   \nDon't come here expecting the best food in the whole wide world.  It is great for grandma's greasy cooking.  I've only eaten breakfast here but it's been amazing everytime.  I got pancakes and they are so fluffy and light and awesome (esp if you add a little butter).  The bacon was nice, thick, large slices; slightly overcooked maybe but super good cuz I love bacon! :)\nThe prices are reasonable and the service is great.  This is a great place for a quick delicious home cooked breakfast!"}
{"input": "Not just for feet. All I can say is....Wow! Worth the extra $$ for an hour full body massage. Simon has the most talented hands to coax your muscles to relax, taking the kinks out with skill. The atmosphere is very desirable and comfortable. You don't realized the importance of human touch until you have a professional work their magic. They provide walk-in service, but I recommend scheduling an appointment for a massage, especially during the early evening hours. My daughter and I had a foot massage there and this too was fantastic! First place whose prices are affordable and well worth indulging in. I highly recommend this little slice of heaven."}
{"input": "We had such a great meal at Spiro's tonight! Neither my dining companion, nor myself had been there previously. We both had a Greek salad, which was prepared table side. I had the Dolmades, and my coworker, the combo plate which had moussaka and dolmas and lamb (which he could not stop raving about). To our surprise our server brought dessert on the house, since we had never dined there before, it was such a nice touch! Ben our server was fantastic and knowledgable. We are both in the industry so we felt guilty about staying until the restaurant closed, but we were just so comfortable and well fed that we lost track of time. Spiro's is very close to my house, it will definitely be my new regular spot. Thank you Ben, and the whole Spiro's crew, for a great time to compliment a rare night off! You rock!"}
{"input": "We had reservations for Easter dinner. Service was slow and we felt forgotten. We ordered the BBQ Oysters, loaded mash and crab cake to share. The oysters were good although the toast was literally a sliver, the loaded mash was very small and the crab cake was luke warm.  Disappointing."}
{"input": "We've been going to this place since it opened and it's always decent, not to mention super fast! TdM is owned by Subway and has a similar feel to it, but I think the quality is much better than Subway. It's a build-your-own burrito and taco place and the ingredients are always fresh and well-stocked. I usually eat vegetarian, so there are plenty of options for me to eat. I always get a veggie burrito and load it up with lots of veggies! I also like their chips and \"medium\" salsa. If ever around Delgado, check out Taco del Mar!"}
{"input": "I'm all about ice cream, really I am. But it was early and I wanted a hot chocolate. The problem is that I'm a hot chocolate snob. Only milk, only dark, whip cream? yes please. So I asked around and got a couple of recommendations from locals and was not disappointed. This is a first for me. I went to an ice cream joint and didn't get ice cream! So think of Mike's as an ice cream joint with a top quality coffee shop inside and you'll be right on."}
{"input": "The pizza here is to die for. Whenever I visit my family in the Olney section of Philadelphia, this is my first choice to order pizza. I recently tried their rib platter and was blown away. The ribs were so juicy, the meat was literally falling off the bone... yummy!!! I devoured the crust on the pizza, which is unusual since I normally don't eat pizza crust! TWO thumbs UP for the food, great service, and super fast delivery. I have no complaints!!\n\nUpdate: July 30, 2015:\n\nPlaced an order for two cheese steaks and the food was just as good as the first time we went. This will definitely be our go to spot in Olney."}
{"input": "Excellent fresh French pastry- so light, crisp, buttery you could suck down three or four before realizing what a decadent pig you were!! Toasted croissants filled with variety of meats, cheeses, veggies- all so good!! Coffee excellent, espresso spot on.  This is lunch and breakfast bakery only- so no booze but none needed.  Very bright clean French  cafe like decor; friendly staff.  Great place!"}
{"input": "Our first time trying on this rainy Sunday! We ordered a whole order of the House Special Fried Rice w/ beef added, A order of chicken wings, a egg roll, & a spring roll! The rice was delish!!!! The only thing was the egg roll was not what I prefer. The spring roll was the best out of the two! Definitely going back soon!!!"}
{"input": "If you like to wait while several tables are open,  terrible service, a dirty restaurant, and very mediocre food that is overpriced for breakfast then you'll love this place! This was one of the worst breakfasts I've ever had. With First Watch around the corner and Pinky's up the street don't waste your time here. I know what you're thinking...but Todd First Watch and Pinky's are way more expensive....Bullsh#t. don't waste your time on this old broken down dump."}
{"input": "I just moved to NOLA from Houston and was lamenting the lack of good Mexican restaurants to my friend when he suggested this place. \n\nSO glad he did! The queso was SO good...I filled up on that before we got our main dish. I ordered the seafood enchiladas and while they were good, they use a red sauce instead of a cream sauce. I would have preferred a cream sauce but these weren't bad at all. My husband ordered beef fajitas and those were good, too.\n\nI had a few margaritas and huh....that's funny. I really don't recall much else about the place.\n\nOh yeah! It's good for groups. There were 6 of us and we all sat around a table laughing, cutting up, drinking the strong, strong margaritas, and eating the delicious queso.  Good service, good food, good times. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"input": "It's a pretty small/cozy bar (so no dancing, pool tables, or room for activity), but the waitresses were able to accommodate the group of people (about 6 people) to a large booth without a problem.  It's a decent bar with a decent size list of beer selections.  There were over 50 beers listed, so you are likely to find something you'd like.  \n\nI'm more impressed that the bartender was able to make a good bitter lemon and gin.  So that's +1 from a 3 stars for me considering that a lotttt of bartenders do not know how to make it.  \n\nBesides the drinks, I've had the Chicken & Portabello Panini and Fish & Chips so none of the Irish dishes. The food is average that's just a tad bit pricey, although the proportion is slightly big.  \n\nService is great though. The waitresses kept checking back a lot to see if we needed more drinks and to reconfirm we've received everything we requested.  I highly appreciated that."}
{"input": "I enjoyed my stay here, despite the horrifically slow elevators. Come to think of it, I think only one (of three) was working!\n\nNow I know why people have weddings here-- I love the decor/look. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. \n\nFree internet and printing in the lobby (sure beats paying for it in your hotel room). Huge beds and a flat-screen TV make for a comfortable stay. \n\nConveniently located within a mall, near the metro. Easy access to Einstein's Bagels, a bar, and the HardRock Cafe."}
{"input": "We love AJ's! The specialty food selections are outstanding. We love to get a light dinner and eat on the patio. Tonight we enjoyed soup and salads. The service experience at the deli counter is sort of hit and miss. Tonight they were understaffed.  We will be back. \n\nFirst of all, the service at the deli was much improved since our last visit!  Tonight was another fun dinner on the patio! We enjoyed the fountain while enjoying our meal of turkey chili and the NY steak dinner. We will be back!"}
{"input": "Here's an update for my further Comcast experience. Our bill was increased to 250.00 a month. We called and removed some luxery items which brought our bill to 225.00 a month. Called 4 time a to see how we could get our bill lowered, as we have been a loyal customer for 14 years. \"Nothing we can do\" was all I heard. We decided to no longer be raped by this company and set up service with Verizon. Called Comcast to cancel once we got hooked up with Verizon. All of a sudden, they can do better and reduce my bill to 140.00 a month....which I would have been extremely happy with. Unfortunately, it should have been offered the four previous times I called.  I have Verizon now and have been quite happy with the installation, customer service, and overall product.  I wish Comcast would go under because they don't care about quality customer service. They could offer me a years free of service, yet I wouldn't take it on principle. Screw you Comcast!"}
{"input": "Having bottle service is KEY here.  The bar is always pretty packed.  I always have a good time here.  The roof has an awesome view and on a night with good weather it is perfect :) \n\nPretty good drinks, awesome atmosphere and great view... I like!"}
{"input": "Great atmosphere and service! I don't know how often they have live music but the band playing the night we stopped in was very good. As for the food, it was good; I wont say it was the best burger I ever had but it wasn't bad; just not as great as I had hoped it would have been. All and all we had a good time and will be back!"}
{"input": "Hmmm. Got a Groupon, ordered delivery.. fast- friendly, no problems there. Pizza was very meh (we got the Nameless.) I had the oven on so as to pop it in there if it was cool- and it was, but we tried it both out of the box, and after a min on a 500 degree pizza stone. Much better off the stone, but still- nothing special at all. The skinny sticks are just pizza crust, no sauce, with cheese.. and unfortunately they came all stuck together  in a jumble. Since the crust was no great shakes, the sticks weren't any better. Food taste alone- sadly the better frozen pies can surpass these guys. Maybe with some time they can tweak what they are doing- they have great ideas going- just need to get a much better product out the door. I really, really had high hopes that they'd be great (their website sells it so well), so it was a big letdown that they were sub-average."}
{"input": "Came across this place with my friends visiting Reno. We were not disappointed what so ever. We walked in around 9:00 and were seating immediately. The server Megan  was really fast and nice. The breakfast menu has a great variety. They have vegan and gluten free options if you prefer. I order the French toast with a side order of their chicken sausage. The portion size was larger than I expected and very affordable. I think my plate was around 8-10 because I added the sausages. The French toast is probably the best French toast that I have ever tasted so if you love French toast you will defiantly not be disappointed!!!"}
{"input": "I never try Trini food before I visit this place. It's like a food adventure for me. The Oxtail is amazing, unbelievable tasty. I will 100% return this place for the Oxtail dish. The jerk wing is also very favorable. I don't quite enjoy the goat Roti, is a ok dish for me."}
{"input": "This place has a great location for the hungry tourist. It manages to be edgy yet chill at the same time. My reason for stopping in was to try the ahi fish tacos with avocado relish, which sounded awesome. At around 3 there was still a healthy amount of people attesting to its popularity and eatability. They had a selection of local microbrews (bottle, not draft) for those interested in getting a taste of Philly in beer form. Alas, I ordered my tacos, but had a little Scooby Doo moment when the arrived. Somehow the chef decided that it was okay to put such a delicate fish in premade taco shells...enough to makes this SoCal girl wince a little and question whether I should consume. Luckily the flavor of the fish was great. I only saw one half inch cube of avocado, but at least the sauce was yummy! \nI got a glimpse of the brunch menu...looks pretty tasty I must say..."}
{"input": "I know I know, silly as it seems, I have not had the pizza here!  but I did get a tortilla soup and 1/2 a Mediterranean salad.  The soup was really yummy with a sprinkle of cilantro and avocado on top.  \n\nthe salad was more \"eh\", I think the dressing that comes with it is too salty.  \n\nBut I am looking to go back for the pizza!  Hopefully they can make a cheese-less one!"}
{"input": "Love this BYOB.  Albeit the environment is cramp and loud, so not a good place for an intimate dinner.   However, the food always lures us back.  The grilled, whole fish is wonderful.  My husband is a big fan of the lamb.   It's a good lively night out, with wonderful full flavored food and attentive, friendly service."}
{"input": "I love coming to this Home Depot.  Everyone is so friendly and helpful.  \n\nI have yet come to find an item \"out of stock' which is great because it's a one stop shopping.\n\nEverything is clean and organized.\n\nThey have do it herself classes (which I have taken a few a while back) and Kids workshops \n(which my son loves).\n\nThey have staff that can help your bring/load your stuff in your car.  \n\n\nWe will definitely be back!"}
{"input": "This place reminds me of home  It's different to the 1 back home but still great. I had the cheesecake fantasy which had bits of fruit & waffle chunks.\nGreat view to the river outside.\nService was efficient."}
{"input": "My friend really, really, really wanted to check this place out... We drove thirty minutes to get there. It wasn't great. The customer service was non existent (you need to ask for a menu, they hardly speak English, making ordering difficult), the food was meh, most things don't have any context/explanation of what the hell it is. It honestly reminded me of the quality of a food cart."}
{"input": "First thing about this place is they have great service. The room was kept very clean, a little out-dated in some aspects but the important stuff was great. I also enjoyed waking up to my windshield and windows on my car cleaned. The bed was VERY comfortable, and I enjoyed the fruit in the room. There is also a fitness room and a massage room (didn't get to try that). Free wi-fi which also allows you to print to their lobby. I also believe you get free amtrak shuttle service for staying here. I would stay again, overall nice and cozy."}
{"input": "Great waxing estheticians at this spa! I just moved to Philadelphia a few months ago and I've had a hard time finding good waxing salons that provide services at a reasonable price. Most places have a back curtain or a back room which is not private enough for body waxes. This is why I've never felt comfortable in other salons. \nThis salon/spa is different! The main floor is designated for manicures and pedicures, chair massages and facial waxing. The upstairs is the spa area where there is a relaxing waiting area and  private rooms. The light is dim and it is a very welcoming environment. I had a full arm and bikini wax, and not only was I happy with the results but I was even able to close my eyes and relax during my procedures. Every detail is taken care of. I can't wait to return!"}
{"input": "I have been going to Bakery House for years and absolutely love it every time! I usually get the chocolate chip cake- it's my favorite!"}
{"input": "This is a big store and is open 24 hours, but the customer service is absolutely terrible. Cashiers have an attitude and the pharmacy is never prepared. When going through the drive through to pick up prescriptions, you will have to wait at least 15 minutes for someone to even address you and then another half an hour to pick up your prescriptions. They should not only hire more people in the pharmacy if they need help, but also change their attitudes towards customers."}
{"input": "I don't know if its just me but I feel like El Camino's quality went down a lot. \n\nDon't get me wrong, if you're looking for a fun place, this is it with a vast variety of drinks this is it.  Food is decent too but nothing out of the norm.  Most of the times I've come here and ordered the same thing, it wasn't consistent or maybe I remembered it to be different?  \n\nMy favorite things to order here is the vegan wings, and even though I am a meat eater, they are pretty good.  Also, their desserts are usually on point, more so than their entrees.  They had a smores bread pudding that was to die for that they removed from their menu.\n\nIf i want drinks I stop on in here from time to time but if I want food, I walk down the street to Dos Segundos that always delivers. The only bonus I like is outdoor seating area where you can hang out with your friend and people watch."}
{"input": "This place has a northern California vibe. Reminds me of breweries in napa. Very open large space and a good selection of craft beer. The other side is a winery which is neat as well. \n\nI recommend trying their flight of beers to get a taste of everything."}
{"input": "Starving after a night on the town. Needed protein for breakfast and these chicken fingers hit the spot!!! Light delicious breading and moist chicken. Cooked perfectly!"}
{"input": "I found this place through yelp. I was attracted because of the +4 star rating! It was right down the street from where I was staying, so I ended up walking. I walked right in with no appointment and was taken immediately. The gentleman who did my nails was extremely nice and worked very precisely! We also had a few laughs too. He did amazing work and I also think it was the fastest mani I have ever gotten. He also did a light hand massage at the end. I got gel and it was $25 which I thought was reasonable. I will definitely go back when I'm back in the area. Highly recommend. \n\nIt is a spacious salon with many mani and pedi stations!"}
{"input": "What can I say?  I'm a sucker for new american.  The owner is a very nice gentleman who really enjoys food.  \n\nThe service was impeccable and the food was Ridiculously good.  We ordered a mixed berry waffle, huevo rancho, traditional breakfast bagel with grits, and best sandwich with fresh fruits.  \n\nI highly recommend the huevo rancho and best sandwich.  The grits was very good as well. \n\nIf you decide to visit this restaurant, say hi to the owner.  He's a great guy."}
{"input": "I have stayed here several times for conferences and always enjoyed my experience. The building itself is very sleek and conveniently located. Access to the skywalk is a huge plus during cold winter stays. Service is friendly and the rooms are comfortable and clean. Great amenities. The exercise room is excellent and well-equipped with plenty of machines, a yoga area, and a pool and hot tub. My only problem is that rooms do not come with a mini fridge, and although one can be requested, during my large conference stays I was not able to get one. Definitely a drawback when you are staying several days!"}
{"input": "First pizza place I tried after moving to STL in May.  We waited for 30 minutes for a table, but it is worth it. \n\nWe tried the SF -style crust(corn meal and thick style) and then the STL which is the thin crust.  I didn't care for, and never really like the thin crust at any pizza joint.  The toppings are amazing and the atmospere is great.  Hopping place!\n\nSit outside and people watch is the way to go here.\n\nPBR on tap and no AB products--don't ask."}
{"input": "I came to Dayley dental on recommendation from a friend. I went in for a checkup and found that I needed some cavities filled. I had put off going to the dentist for a while because I have had bad experiences in the past. I needed them done the same day for insurance purposes. Dr. Dayley and his staff was awesome. They stayed after to get me finished up and were so nice about everything. Dr. Dayley is so nice and friendly. He made the whole experience of getting dental work so much less uncomfortable just by chatting with me throughout. He recommended some things that I could benefit from but didn't push anything. I am so glad I went here and I will definitely be back and will recommend them forever. Wonderful office, hygentists, assistants, and doctor."}
{"input": "Best auto body shop in Philadelphia in my opinion. My Honda Fit had accumulated all sorts of nicks, dents, scratches, and even some really ugly lime deposit stains on the hood of my car. I took it to Devlin's to get touched up, and what I got back was a car that looked like it just rolled off the assembly line. Honestly, if I told you my car was 3 years old and had gone through a few scrape-ups, I don't think you'd be able to tell. Ed Devlin is a miracle worker, and he does his magic at a super affordable price... I was shocked at how inexpensive the bill came out to be."}
{"input": "I brought my fur baby Vito to The Grooming Room for the first time on Saturday 6/18/16 and requested Rachel because of the reviews I read about her. I have my cosmetology license so I know a good cut even though I cut humans, I know when you get a quality cut or a shit one as I've been doing hair since 95'.  Rachel was very good. I am finicky about my baby's face and she cut it the way I requested. (I did tweek it a tiny bit but usually I have to clean-up the whole cut when I bring him home).  He looked and smelled wonderful.   I will be going back and Rachel will be the one I request again.  She really did the best job of any groomer I have ever brought him to. Thanks Rachel."}
{"input": "Passably good dim sum. I was in love with the Chinese broccoli in oyster sauce, the sesame and red bean balls, and the shrimp stuffed eggplant. Most of the rest was good too. We also ended up with an odd, gelatinous beef that wasn't to my taste at all but I am sure it was a mistake of ordering to my liking rather than sub par cooking by the restaurant. I would return, but I think I would go for their soup with roast duck and dumplings over dim sum next time. Their duck and pork and bakery case items always look so tasty when I am here."}
{"input": "This was my 1st time here. I had the man do my pedicure. He took his time doing my feet, and then he did a great job painting my toenails. I will defentily come back here again."}
{"input": "I'm not sure why I'm seeing such low reviews but this place is AMAZING. We sat at the outside bar area, the service was excellent and the food came out super fast. Their guacamole is sooooo good and it's so fresh. Everything we ordered was fresh and wonderful. I will def be back. We had the ahi tuna taco and the mahi taco. Portions are pretty big too, prices are awesome."}
{"input": "Good, steady Saturday business but they're a bit slow. They only have one person doing the Pre-wash, and while thorough, it slows up the line.\n\nNo military discount, but they do offer one for law enforcement. Nice waiting area with tv, pinball, bowling game, Galaga and...Ms. Pac-Man!!! 5 stars for that!! However, they lose 4 of those stars for shabby work. My rims looked absolutely horrible! Apparently, the car washing gauntlet does not reach the wheels/rims. Additionally, they completely failed to wipe any of the brake dust from any of the 4 rims. I called one of the attendants to re-do the rims but the 2nd go round wasn't much more remarkable.\n\nFor the $25 \"St. Charles\" wash, I'd like my rims to be washed and shining!\n\nDo not EVER go here for your auto needs."}
{"input": "What a great local spot! Drinks, food, server and ambiance were very nice. You could tell everything takes a little longer to make because it's from scratch.... well worth the wait."}
{"input": "We tried two varieties of pizza and both were excellent. Easily some of the highest quality pizza I've had in South Jersey.   The owner John was there and was warm and friendly.  The actual facility is immaculately clean.  With all the mediocre pizza places on every corner, it's great to find a place that uses high quality ingredients.  You can absolutely taste the difference.  I highly recommend Organico."}
{"input": "We hired Minuteman to re-key our new home as well as add deadbolts as needed.  They were prompt, courteous, and friendly.  We will definitely use Minuteman in the future. (Meridian, ID)"}
{"input": "We found ourselves in South Tucson needing a good meal from somewhere other than the kitchens of the chain hotels surrounding the airport.  Thank you Yelpers for delivering another great place!\n\nA reconverted 1960's era A & W chain fast food stand [I can detect those old bone shards still!], we enjoyed a wonderful meal at a reasonable price.\n\nI had the catfish smothered in poblano sauce and melted cheese.  They told me it was farm catfish but it tasted like the catfish I used to catch out of a lake near my house as a little kid.  Farm fish never tastes this real.\n\nMy wife had chile relleno - fresh peppers, not surprising this time of year but definite kudos to the chef.\n\nThe late-stage adolescents with us enjoyed their enhiladas and chimichangas too."}
{"input": "The beer is fantastic.  Normally at a brewery there will be one or two standouts, with all the others just... meh... Try the flight.  For eight bucks or so you wont regret it, and every single one is special. The food and atmosphere is standard brew pub style, but fine. My buddies loved the fish and chips.  Service is excellent."}
{"input": "I love this place, too bad I only go about 4 times a year.  Its more of treat for me.  Quality food & service and would expect nothing less based on the price."}
{"input": "These guys are the best, I've used them twice for moves in Philly and NJ. Easy to book, even on short notice, the movers are great at their jobs, on time, and take great care to ensure nothing is damaged. Highly recommended."}
{"input": "I've spent an unmentionable amount of money at the Flying Cupcake Bakery because the cupcakes are just that good.  If you are going for the first time make sure to pick up at Red Velvet Elvis.  It might be my favorite cupcake in the entire world (and I've been to The Petite Cafe, home of the stuffed cupcake, in NJ)."}
{"input": "Cute little shop with a nice seating area out front. Tons of flavors to choose from and lots of extras too. Reasonable prices and very nice customer service. My only complaint is that the ice wasn't quite as soft as I would've liked but it was still good and the ice cream was delicious too."}
{"input": "Very honest, gave me right estimate. Fixed oil leak and never had problem again."}
{"input": "A favorite!!!  Always a good time and always enjoy great food from  the crab fries to wings to mussels to pizza.....all outstanding!   Personal favorites of mine are the buffalo wings, mussels white,  crab legs, and of course the crab fries!"}
{"input": "Just cut the cable cord and the huge expense that went with it. After reading others reviews on the time spent waiting to see a service rep to return Cox's equipment I was dreading going there. BUT (and the 5 stars is for this only) when I went to the Marrero store yesterday around 12pm there was no one there. Not one customer. Plenty of service reps though. I was helped immediately by a really nice rep and was in and out in under 5 minutes. Credit where credit is due!"}
{"input": "The owner Frank is super nice and always willing to look into ordering beer you want if they don't currently have it. They don't have a huge food menu but what they do have is good. I mostly go for the beer, they have one of the best selections around. The shop is clean, open late and has a small parking lot outback. They also have tables so you can sit and eat."}
{"input": "Updating previous trip- I still would take my kids there but the derma bond sucked. Poor buddy has a scar. Yea, yea...it's in a bad spot. And he's not quite two (read: squirmy.) \n\nI don't think it's too much to want it all. \n\n :-/"}
{"input": "Never had a problem with eating at wuffle house till today. The staff was just so rude and disrespectful. We had been sitting for 15 mins until we ask for service but all we got was just some rude server with an attitude who raise her voice at us telling us to wait because we weren't the only ones there but they seem to have time to be standing around getting there daily gossip,  Which seem more important then doing their job."}
{"input": "Oh my goodness, the cannoli!  Just amazing.  Simply amazing.  There's not much more to say than that."}
{"input": "I really, really, really like so much about this hotel. For starters, it's BEAUTIFUL!!  Everytime I go to Reno, this is where I stay and I will continue to stay here when I go!!\n\nPRO's:\n\n1. The Spa is amazing! The staff working there are so friendly and helpful.The pools in the spa area are so clean. There were plenty of towels, water, juice, etc. \n\n2. The rooms were very clean and organized. \n\n3. The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. We didnt like the location of our room, so they moved us to another location with no problems.\n\n4. They have a little diner that is there open 24 hours and has good food. Granted its a bit expensive, but it's a casino, what do you expect?\n\n\nCON's:\n\n1. The bathrooms in the hotel rooms didnt have fans, so when you're in the shower it gets so steamy, so fast!\n\n2. We ordered rooms services and we ordered coffee as well, and they didnt bring creamer."}
{"input": "Pretty cool place to visit. Has stuff priced from $10 up to thousands for some big beautiful geo displays. \n\nParking lot can get very crowded on the weekends so pray for a spot close to the door."}
{"input": "We see Dr. Gloudemans, and she's a wonderful doctor. Friendly, upbeat, up on the most recent research, and pro-vaxx (hooray!!). She's proactive about problems after making sure things are worth worrying about-- \"let's keep an eye on this, and if there's still a problem in a month or two, come back in and we'll see about a referral to a specialist.\"\n\nAs others have mentioned, we've had a few billing hiccups. We received a bill saying we were past due on 3 appointments' fees, despite paying all copays in the office. Luckily it was all straightened out after a phone call, but it's been frustrating on that front."}
{"input": "I wasn't up for coffee, so I opted for tea.  I got the red velvet tea, and it was so good!  It was sweet enough where I didn't need to use honey.\n\nIf you're not into coffee, definitely check out the tea selection."}
{"input": "Spent a Saturday afternoon here, and the pools and deck were crowded, but our server, Travis was awesome! He was attentive to our needs, and had great suggestions for our lunch. Drinks were delivered promptly.  Travis is a local, and very friendly. He was an encyclopedia of local places, and tipped is on where to find sand dollars that was spot on. \n\nIt was hot, but it's a beach, and there are two pools to cool off in right next to the bar and patio. Live music was great also. We had burgers and sandwiches and fries, and the good was great. If you go, wear a swimsuit and enjoy the refreshing pools! Didn't deal with bartenders, but rum runners were excellent, and so was our server, Travis!"}
{"input": "Reading these reviews about bad service, my suggestion would be to sit in the bar area. I was there last night to watch the bcs football game, and the server/bartender, daniel, was one of the best servers I have ever experienced. service was outstanding. They have over 40 beers on tap , which is kinda cool but many of them are unheard of beers so...  anyways the only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is that the nachos i ordered were not that great."}
{"input": "Love love loved this place! Will definitely be back! The quality is superb and fresh. They have really great roll concepts and a cozy little atmosphere."}
{"input": "Service was wonderful but the food said otherwise. The nachos they were dried and gross basically tasteless and the steak was over cooked and so was the burger. The fries were salty and the bread that came with the steak plate was over buttered. The broccoli was delicious though but everything else was disappointing. Maybe I should've ordered pizza or something else"}
{"input": "This is no where near as good as Tony Angelo's and way overpriced."}
{"input": "First of all, cash only. Which they prominently display, but if you're reading this and didn't catch that in the yelp description, you'd be missing out on delicious food. They have a decent menu of tacos, tortas etc. In addition they have a large variety of serve yourself condiments that are delicious and make the food that much better. It's outdoor seating but they have a tent so you are in the shade. I would recommend absolutely this as an affordable and delicious lunch option!"}
{"input": "The Eagles started out as such a strong team this year! I went to a couple of preseason games and was impressed by what we had. So much skill! The rookies we picked up are great and our starters are still strong. \n\nNow if only we could get rid of McNabb. The tie against the Bengals did it for me. Too much embarrassment. I still root for them and still wish they win (especially against the Cowboys) but I wouldn't pay to watch another game at the Linc this season. Its much easier to take the defeat at home. I watch every game and anticipate a win. I'm just tired of the disappointment. There were many games we could have won but didn't. I'm tired of McNabb's low throws. How is a receiver supposed to catch the ball and continue running if its thrown at the floor? Lets face it, McNabb folds under pressure and that's whats preventing us from winning more games. \n\nThe Eagles have no chance this year...but maybe next year!"}
{"input": "Love the food and the atmosphere. The waitresses are always outstanding! Plenty of bang for your buck. Would highly recommend. When our family comes in from Arkansas, we always make sure we take them to try Jerry Bob's."}
{"input": "I've been visiting NOLA, and Back to the Garden was one of the places listed that is great for vegetarians. I really enjoyed my lunch here. Had the red bean chili with TVP, salad, and corn chips, and a cup of fruit salad.\n\nI loved the chili, it was a bit bland, but very good. My friend put hot sauce all over hers. Salad, fruit and chips were fresh and good.\n\nI loved the basic atmosphere, and enjoyed watching the folks working in the kitchen area assemble everyone's orders.\n\nGood, basic vegetarian food. I really enjoyed it!"}
{"input": "It's hard to find Cafe Reconcile with its doors open, since it is only open for lunch on weekdays, but this innovative program/restaurant is worth a trip into Central City, my favorite New Orleans neighborhood.  Central City has a rich and fascinating civil rights history.  During segregation, Oretha Castle Haley Blvd, the main drag where Cafe Reconcile is located, was the Canal Street of black New Orleans.  Now, OC Haley is making a come back.  Cafe Reconcile is leading the charge.  Delicious Southern cooking, I love the collard greens and fried chicken, and a program to get vulnerable youth off the streets.  Youth in New Orleans, and especially Central City, have had it rough since Katrina.  Violence is at an all time high and there are very few options for jobs as these kids look at a bleak future.  Cafe Reconcile is creates an alternative community, another family, for kids.  So, tip big.  Stop by Ashe Cultural Arts Center, across the street, when you are in the area."}
{"input": "Food was great!!!! I had the crab cake Benedict and it was delicious! Great service and smoothies"}
{"input": "I've been a customer at Ted Peters since 1977 while attending college in St Petersburg and in Tampa. What can I say? ; they have the best smoked fish in the southeast. A laid-back atmosphere and super friendly service. An iced mug cold beer and a smoked mullet fish spread sandwich; it gets you a little bit closer to heaven on a hot Florida day."}
{"input": "Great little wine bar with an excellent patio for enjoying live music. Came to see Casey Reeves play music here and really enjoyed it. Nice wine selection, plenty of beer and spirits as well. No food, but a casual Italian place shares the patio, several other solid food options within walking distance. Bob has a nice place in a fun part of this small town's downtown. Keep up the good work!"}
{"input": "First time here and I had high expectations for this place with the high ratings. I was disappointed with my tacos and salsa. I love green spicy salsa and this place green salsa and avocado salsa was NOT spicy at all. I also love tacos de lengua and this place tacos de lengua had no flavor at all and they only give you one tortia per taco. They say hand made tortias and I was not able to tell since nothing had flavor. Wouldn't go back."}
{"input": "Everytime I'm in Santa Barbara, this place is the best for good food and a great view.... Nothing like enjoying a good meal while listening to the ocean!"}
{"input": "Excellent healthy options for NOLA dining with lots of to go choices. I had turkey meatballs and spaghetti. It is a wonderful lunch place."}
{"input": "I went last night with a few friends and let me say I was impressed, not necessarily with the quality of the food (nothing wrong with it by any means) or the decor, but the servers: how they don't kill every 4th customer is beyond me. I heard tables on both sides of us giving the most ridiculous of complaints to our/their server. Both tables were demanding as hell and already said loudly to eachother that they weren't tipping because of x, y and z reasons, and then were dumbfounded that there's a gratuity on their bill (it says it in the menu, anything over $50) their server, smaller girl so with purple hair, carried upwards of 4 plates at once, explained the menu perfectly and had an eagle eye for every table in her section and dealt with ridiculous complaints like a true professional. Thumbs up and five stars to the staff, customers, learn how to be basic humans, or stay home."}
{"input": "The atmosphere was nice and small. Very busy for brunch, expect at least a 30-45 minute wait. I recommend the spinach, caramelized onion and goat cheese omelet, but request a little less goat cheese. (this one was way too much, would have been better with 1/2 the amount).  Oh and the fruit was served perfectly ripe. Cash only."}
{"input": "I haven't been to a great many art museums, but this has got to be the best value around. How much better can you get than free?! And it is so peaceful and amazing inside! Even a casual art-viewer can appreciate the variety of interesting, beautiful pieces. And then there's the garden and 100 acres outside... I love this place."}
{"input": "Granted I don't eat cheese so reviwing a pizza joint is a little off, but myself and all the other vegans and ex-vegans I know swear by the alegro tomato pie. It's fricken delicious. Beare in mind this place in university city so your going to have to put up with more drunk jocks then you can shake a stick at but hey if you can't beat 'em join 'em...alegros sells beer."}
{"input": "Worst Wawa in the Tri-State area. Always full of druggies, weirdos, creeps, panhandlers and the worst deli staff ever."}
{"input": "Yo this draft latte is BS good. \n\nAlso the guy at the register complimented my tie. 10/10"}
{"input": "$1.00 any draft beer until 10, are you kidding me!!! (Pretty damn good selection if I do say so)"}
{"input": "The food here is good but I feel it's just a little over priced. For 2 adults and 2 kids, I spent a little over $40. For 3 burgers and a hot dog, I think it was a bit much."}
{"input": "The service and bathroom was horrible, The soap Dispenser didn't work (and the toilets were out of order) Zaxby's need to do better with who they are hiring and the cleanliness of the store. The lady at the drive thru and the cooks did not have on a hair net. The sweet tea was sour, the ice machine took forever (it seems like) to dispense ice. The chicken strips and fries were dry. The person taking my order was not welcoming at all. All the employees on the front line seem to be playing around rather then working. A lot of lout talking coming from the back. Not a inviting environment at all, I will not come back to this location and I \"suggest\" strongly that \"You\" think about it twice before coming to this location."}
{"input": "I'll never give 1 or 2 stars for a restaurant because I don't feel that does any good and it takes a lot to be that bad.\n\nI just got home after ordering takeout and I ordered the buffalo grilled chicken wrap. Well it's only grilled chicken minus the buffalo sauce. Not a big deal, but for the life of me, I can't seem to get a to-go order that is right when I leave this place. I blame the cook not doing his or her job and lack of management oversight. \n\nI think I've given up on to-go orders here."}
{"input": "What a find this place is! Wild game on the menu, cooked perfectly, a great local wine list, live music at the bar, and just a great vibe thru this old ass wood building...you have no reason not to come here, unless you suck"}
{"input": "Desserts and Ambience... Crowds vary by the time and day you go, but quiet or crowded, it's an interesting \"bistro\" type place. You can't miss with this spot as a date night locale - always delicious, and cozy. The menu has changed very little over time, and it's not overly extensive, but they often have a new \"special dessert\" or special of the day. Be warned as their favorites do run out, so the later in the day you go, items may not be available. Their carrot cake is pretty good, moist and not too sweet. Located close to local schools and Webster University, this is often a place to go to escape those \"regular\" establishments. #AsianLadyLikes"}
{"input": "YUM!!!\n\nI have became a fan of Earl's Sandwiches through my many trips to Las Vegas every year.\n\nEvery trip I make to Las Vegas, NV, I make it a point to eat there multiple times. So yesterday when returning to Philadelphia from a quick weekend trip home, I thought I'd treat myself to a quick sandwich before I was picked up from the airport. \n\nI ordered my regular Veggie Sandwich and although it was still tasteful and delicious it was different from the version I typically get in the Las Vegas Planet Hollywood casino. This PHL airport version had lettuce and tomatoes which the LV version does not, it was super peppery and the veggies had some sort of Italian dressing on them. \n\nI would definitely still recommend this location of Earl's Sandwiches to anyone wanted a great sandwich, however prefer the LV version better."}
{"input": "Great food! From the outside, the building is kind of nondescript. Inside set up just like a diner. Lots of selection for breakfast lunch and dinner, great service, coffee and food really good. Would definitely go back."}
{"input": "This Starbucks is struggling.  Understaffed and undertrained.  Avoid until they get it together"}
{"input": "We were on the top floor - 14th. Large, spacious, clean rooms. I would definitely return and stay here again. \n\nI liked that you needed to use the room key to use the elevators and to get through the front doors after 11pm. It was a more secure feeling.\n\nBreakfast was pretty good, loved the waffle maker!\n\nAlso, free computer/printer access dedicated to printing boarding passes. Very handy!\n\nFree room wifi, and front desk called to make sure we were happy with our room a couple hours after we checked in. \n\nThe door attendant was helpful too.. holding our bags in a closet while we went to a museum.. and hailing a cab in the rain for us.\n\nPrice was good too. Highly recommended!"}
{"input": "We had a wonderful breakfast here on a friends birthday. My food was really really good - had omelet and potatoes. Very interesting taste combination on the menu omelet. Can't recall the name. \nCompanions had similar experiences. \nService was very good. Pricing is fair."}
{"input": "Had lunch here twice while visiting New Orleans. Food was amazing both times. Had the filet mignon udon and honey glazed pork roll banh mi. Would definitely come back if visiting New Orleans again."}
{"input": "I came here to eat after moving my boyfriend into his apartment. I love the interior and the vibe was friendly and active. Lots of people at 11 pm on a Saturday night, although they came in waves. I was afraid their kitchen would be closed but I'm so glad it wasn't! I ordered the beef sandwich and it came in a reasonable amount of time. The sandwich was a respectable size and quite delicious. Their fries are to die for!!! Shoestring with just the right texture and amount of salt. \nMy bf and his family were drinking, and I was impressed with how friendly the bar staff was. They were more than happy to explain to us their beer selection and gave us samples often! They were always attentive, despite the busy hour, and our drinks were quickly replenished. I would gladly come here again."}
{"input": "It was a group of us and we had issues with our order. We had to send back some of our orders. The coffee was cold the omelette was disgusting taste as though they didn't clean the griddle it was cooked on. Two of my friends had steak and it was burnt!"}
{"input": "This was my favorite place on my trip to NOLA! The service was the best I've ever had (Gave a 30% tip). Very attentive and went though the entire menu. The Tuna appetizer was spectacular especially with Caviar on top! \nI also loved my catfish sandwich, great flavor and very lightly breaded. This will be a place I come to each time I'm in NOLA. They also give you complimentary bread! Bit on the pricier side for a lunch but oh so worth it!"}
{"input": "Tyson is on point, sharp and follows through on his word. I brought an RV with a ford front end to him not only did he get me in right away but he finished ahead of time. Parts were ordered and in shop and the guys were working on it next day. I had my RV bumper replaced on the ford front end in 3 days and back on the road. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Only place I will take my vehicles, as a business owner it's important for great service. Manny and Tyson are great!"}
{"input": "When with some local friends for dinner and drinks and it was a cool place, definitely very trendy with the old warehouse feel and wood and industrial vibe. They brew there own beers as the name suggests, I had the copperhead pale ale which was very good. I had the Reuben and it was great, lots of meat piled high, also had the beer battered fried and they were awesome...highly recommend the fries. Others had bacon cheeseburgers and they enjoyed them. Good place to meet friends for food and drinks."}
{"input": "I put five stars on this review but it seems to have disappeared \nAnyways this place serves such wonderful sushi, the workers here are really friendly especially Chef Giho! The atmosphere here is very pleasant \n my friends and I really enjoyed this place and will definitely come back for more"}

{"input": "Mmm, hibachi scallops :-)\n\nI am a sucker for scallops -- so simple, but the flavors are not.  Well, my seafood dinner started out perfectly with the Benihana punch.  Haha, I am a Malibu Bay Breeze babe, so bring on the yummy rum and fruitiness!\n\nWell, the hibachi experience at Benihana was predictable enough, but a good predictable as hibachi consists of clean, fun entertainment.  And, of course, there was the anticipation of a yummy scallop dinner, which I indeed had.  \n\nNot bad for the suburbs, woohoo!  \n\nP.S.: Thank you, Benihana, for playing \"Life Less Ordinary\" by Carbon Leaf ANNNND \"Hopeless\" by KT Tunstall IN A ROW while I was waiting for my hometown girlfriends to arrive ;-)"}
{"input": "The food was excellent.  The service was ok.  The fried oyster salad was very good.  The seafood gumbo is silky smooth.  The atmosphere is a bit noisy, in the front dining room.  The bar looked very old and cool."}
{"input": "I ate at Puckett's yesterday for lunch, and I have to say it was some mighty tasty food for an old-fashioned meat-and-three.  But I actually had a meat-and-two!  Definitely check out the squash casserole.  it was quite the tasty dish.  I'd also recommend their meatloaf, which is what I had.\n\nMy only complaint--and it's a minor one--is that they advertise cornbread.  Yes, it's cornbread, but not a slice of cornbread like you typically think of it.  People in the North would call it a corn fritter.  Being from KY, I'd call it a hoe cake.  It's cornbread but more like a cornbread pancake."}
{"input": "FAN.TAS.TIC! This place is the real deal, folks! A group of co-workers and I visited here for lunch this week. It came highly recommended by a few of them.  There was a decent sized group of us, but we were seated right away.\n\nWe started with the Flash Fried Brussel Sprouts. These were SO GOOD!!  Everyone at the table enjoyed them.  For my meal, I ordered the Block Burger with no bun, and was able to add a half salad instead of the fries. There's an upcharge of $3 to do this, but the salad is large! And it's only the half sized version! You chose between the Block salad or the Beet and Apple salad. I chose the Block which is almost like a Cobb salad. It was so fresh and tasty!  The burger was cooked to perfection and exactly what I wanted.\n\nThe staff were attentive, friendly, and personable.  The restaurant itself was clean and the decor was nice.  I would definitely visit again!"}
{"input": "I really liked the food. Our server was a bit uninformed of the menu, but she was nice. It's a beautiful spot with a great outside seating area. Will definitely be back to try more items from their menu. I overheard the owner telling another table that they grind up their own meat to make hamburger in house. That sounds good!"}
{"input": "Probably the most expensive game in town. But totally worth it for me. I upgraded myself to the executive locker rooms because that gives me zero excuses for why I can't go to the gym before work or after if I am going out later that night. I always have my makeup, hair stuff, etc in my locker. Just getting back to the gym after a long absence due to health issues so I'm taking it slow. I've seen one or two machines that are not quite working right but the facility as a whole is pretty sharp & welcoming. You have tons of options of what to do classes wise, equipment wise...\nMy only 2 down sides are that I wish they were open a little later on weekends, but that's just me moving slowly on my time off. I wish there was a bit more ritation with the class schedule. There are classes I'd like to take but they always run mid day, never really early, after work or weekends. So no option to try them. I'm sure it's an instructor issue so not likely something that will change. Overall I'm super happy that I joined."}
{"input": "Nice beach and not as crowed at Clearwater beach. Parking was easy but I went on a Wednesday so not sure how it is on the weekend. There is a parking meter and it's a dollar fifty or two dollars per hour. Calm water so it's great for kids and nice bathrooms. The beach was pretty clean except for the cigarette butts. I would definitely go back."}
{"input": "Awesome detailing job. My car was DIRTY. Hadn't washed it in months. Got the executive detailing option now look at me."}
{"input": "Terrible service.  I ordered take out and after 25 minutes I had to cancel my order.  I got my money back but what the hell?  It wasn't even busy.  I was watching them as the food came out of the kitchen and neither the kitchen staff nor the people serving had any idea what was going on.  Everyone looked clueless.  I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised that my food never appeared."}
{"input": "Omg this was so yummy!!!! Im here from Atlanta for work and this was so amazing!!!! I will be back for sure!!!!"}
{"input": "Came here on a Saturday night it was just ok. The bouncers were rude at the door but the bartenders and receptionist were nice. It was almost empty and nobody was dancing it was awkward. We ended up leaving and going to another spot."}
{"input": "Sooooo good!!! I prefer to take out and I have never actually picked up myself so I have no idea besides what I am told on how the dining experience is... Basically very Bosnian /Bosnian people in the restaurant... But who doesn't like diversity? And that's all I was told also I heard its pretty clean! Cheers to this place for making awesome gyros!"}
{"input": "AMAZING! The shrimp 4 way platter was SO GOOD! All 4 ways delicious but my fave was the coconut shrimp. I'm already addicted to the coconut rice. The service was fabulous! Josh did a great job! We went yesterday for lunch and plan on going back tonight for dinner. I can't wait to try something new and the key lime pie! Award winning!! Yum!"}
{"input": "This place is awesome ! The staff is amazing .. Love the authentic Italian food.. Best Pizza I ever had!! Gabby and Sheila were so polite and helpful in picking out some specials!!"}
{"input": "My cholesterol went up when I walked in the door and looked at the menu. What mattered most was the food was so good. The waitstaff was helpful in helping me make a decision. Don't expect to eat at the location and the prices are cheap. Enjoy!"}
{"input": "this review is in reference to business practice; a friend purchased a spa package for me when my  first son was born, very generous and sweet of her. Long story short, csection complications, motherhood, 2 moves and storage /movers nightmares. I could not find the physical gift card until this year from time we moved over 2 years ago, I tried to make an appointment without the physical card, they informed me I need the card and number on the card. I call now to make an appointment with the card information and they inform me now it expired after 1 year of issuing and they cant find the gift card in the system.\nCautionary tale for those thinking of buying gift cards or who currently need to redeem one.  I would expect more from a \"top\" tier spa."}
{"input": "They just opened today and WOW! Aren't we lucky to now have 2 meaderies within a mile or two of each other. \nMead is a type of fermented honey beverage. The ABV (alcohol percent) is generally 10-14% so more along the lines of wine than beer there. \n\nWe tried Goober Vitis (peanut butter and jelly), Suzy's Cherry Pie, and the coffee one. All were PERFECT. Flavors are pure, beautiful nose, all around great. \n\nThe space is very nice, nice big tables that seat 6-8 easily, an L-shaped bar, a stand-up bar around the tanks, then there are picnic tables outside."}
{"input": "sushi was great, service was great and best of all it is BYOB.  They have a lot of specialty rolls including the regular rolls."}
{"input": "When you absolutely have to satisfy your sweet tooth, this is the first place you should consider. No matter which cake you choose...you have chosen wisely! A friendly staff will let you sample whatever your eyes are set on!"}
{"input": "Let me start by saying I have had many great experiences at Jones but I forgot what it's like to book a reservation for a star group restaurant.\nI tried to make a Sunday brunch reservation before the flower show for 10 people and was told I needed to speak with some one in the events office( not sure when a party of ten became an event).\nI was told to book this i would need a preset menu and a deposit. Who does this? I spent over 25 years working in restaurants doing every job from busboy up to managing partner and I have never heard of doing this. I guess the Star group doesn't need the sales"}
{"input": "We set up an online appt, meeting and transaction was very simple and painless. We opted for a 2hr side by side ride where we had a four-seater with our guide Matt (who by the way was super awesome and informative).  Throughly enjoyed our ride with some superb views."}
{"input": "Good customer service. Bill was very accommodative. They were able to replace my brake pads in about an hour and send me on my way."}
{"input": "Here's the thing, y'all: Don't come expecting some fancy-shmancy-LA-annoying-hipster type of burger. This isn't exactly Instagram quality. But if you want a good, satisfying burger and shake that'll fill your little tummy? You got it here.\n\nAlso big props to our awesome server; she was hilarious.\nPS. Totally dug the banoculate milkshake-- chocolate and banana. Perfect for people like me who just want BOTH :)"}
{"input": "We were really impressed with the environment, service, pricing, and quality of the food. They have a good variety of food and we really enjoyed everything we got, especially the flatbread. We had our kids with us and I appreciated the variety included in the kid's meals, as many times it seems like kids meals are an afterthought with not many good (or healthy) options."}
{"input": "My first trip to Susanna Foo was at 6 months old when the restaurant was still a hole-in-the-wall takeout joint owned by Susanna's parents. My parents have been taking my brother and I ever since. I have many fond memories of Susanna fashioning dolls for us out of the linen napkins and preparing Chicken with Cashew Nuts when we refused to eat anything else. The food has always been reliable, but now that I am an adult, I find it lacking excitement. The service is always impeccable and I have never been disappointed by the overall decor or ambience. I'd like to see Susanna improve upon some of her traditional recipes by either adding new flavors or perhaps returning to her Chinese roots with a more ethnic menu. I'm hoping there will be a revitalization and that I will come to love Susanna Foo as much as I did as a child."}
{"input": "First time in Louisana and I was very happy. You can tell its good when the place is full of locals. I was already full after eatting the sampler! The fish was fresh and service was great. We didn't drive here but the parking situation was limited but I guess thats fine since there was still a wait. If you cant find parking....just know you will have to wait. Good experience."}
{"input": "We previously ordered traditional Greek fare here - gyros, spanakopita, falafel. Tonight I tried the blackened tilapia-- so glad I did -- it was fantastic. Delicious meal and good service from Sarah"}
{"input": "Excellent food! We had such a complicated order for hibachi, and they were so gracious. We had four tofu and vegetable, one vegan, and one chicken hibachi. For the rice, we had one without butter or eggs, four with butter but no eggs, and one with eggs and butter. As you can see, we were totally annoying. But our server and chef were so accommodating.  Our chef, Tanaka, was great...and the tofu was AMAZING. We also had miso soup, noodles, vegetables, and fried rice. Everything was great except the vegetables, which were pretty bland. We also got a side of mushrooms, which was a waste...not flavorful at all. Portions were big. Service was great!"}
{"input": "I ordered the chicken enchiladas and was rather pleased with them. I wouldn't say they're better than any other place, but they were satisfying. I didn't enjoy the beans that came with them, though. They were a little bitter in my opinion. The rice was dry.\n\nThis doesn't affect my view of the place, but the plate was so dang hot! I accidentally touched the edge of the plate with my pinky and burned myself instantly. I now have a fat blister because of it."}
{"input": "Pizza was good, many many options. Awesome Garlic Bread Ap. Salad was tasty and the desert (strawberries/ seasonal) is definitely worth ordering."}
{"input": "Prices are higher than other close by stores.  We decided to stop in and purchase an advertised (street sign advertisement) beer on a whim.  This would have been a good purchase but they didn't have it in stock.  Call it false advertising, bait and switch, or poor inventory planning as I stopped in a couple of days later and still no sale item.  This is not my first choice, rarely stop in due to the repeated nature of my concerns.  I assume they are less competitive due to their small footprint, so while I can accept higher prices as a result, the store should yank it's advertising if it can't fill orders."}
{"input": "Horrible experience tonight our service never checked on us. We had to ask the host for boxes, napkins drinks etc. Plus our food was cold. The ribs were burnt or over cooked. The food would have been good if it was warm. Ciara was able to give us complementary cornbread"}
{"input": "If I could give this place zero stars, I would.  All I can say is BYOP - Bring Your Own Purell.  I'm sure there are plenty of bars on Bourbon that have shady practices, but if you go in the women's bathroom in any sort of established bar or restaurant you should be able to wash your hands with soap without having to pay for it!  There is a female bathroom attendant for the women's bathroom that makes you tip her to use the soap and a paper towel.  What kind of place does this?  Are you going to start charging your patrons for the toilet paper too?"}
{"input": "We ate here tonight. The lettuce on my wife's salad was limp, the chicken was under cooked and the salad was drench in salad dressing. My dinner tasted good but was cold. By the time I got back to our motel room, the bathroom was all that was on my mind. Never again."}
{"input": "Tacos.....\nThe chips and salsa were pretty lame.....and the tacos were ok.....nothing special....."}
{"input": "Came for all-you-can-eat, and ended up waiting for over half an hour to get our order in. The servers completely ignored us, while taking orders from the tables around us. And on top of that, all of the rolls contain \"extras\" not listed on the menu. One roll surprised us by having sweet mustard sauce on it, which did NOT taste very good....\nOn the bright side, once we actually got our orders in they didn't take all that long to make them."}
{"input": "I don't usually like going home smelling like smoke for a week, but Pal's is one dive bar that is worth it. Taco Tuesdays (2 for $2) has my heart and I'm not ready to break it off any time soon.\n\nThe cocktail menu is creative and tasty, so I make it a point to try something new each time I go. I may make a few faces here and there at how strong the drinks are, but they don't disappoint. A drink being \"too strong\" has never been a bad complaint, I'm sure. \n\nBe warned: this is one SMALL bar! You may have to leave the entire posse at home."}
{"input": "Not bad. Sushi roll was good but options were limited. Hibachi grill: i got steak...chef asked me 2x how i like mine-medium...Still ended up with well done. Rest of my group had chicken which all voiced lacked seasoning. \n\nBeware they DO NOT have a late happy hour 8-11 as advertised on their website. We asked the staff about it and they claimed 8-11 was for a different location. Their website nowhere indicates the happy hour is for a specific location nor does the website indicate they have multiple locations at all."}
{"input": "As the name implies, very efficient service. Service person was also friendly, and he had me out in no time  Will definitely return in the future."}
{"input": "First time visit the other day, amazing!!!! Best hot chicken anywhere!!! Will def be a must stop every time we come to Nashville!!!"}
{"input": "While en route to see a friend perform at the Raven Lounge, I decided to pick up some sushi to go since said bar does not serve food.  The place itself is small, but the atmosphere is great for lunch or early dinner if you have time to sit down and eat there.  They also offer a special if you buy two or three rolls from the same list.  Their special rolls are great too--I had the American Dream roll (which had mango on the outside with spicy salmon, yellowtail, tuna, and tobiko (tiny fish roe)) and a regular shrimp tempura roll.  I will definitely come back again when I have time to eat in!"}
{"input": "I miss Mexically, but if you can't make the trek/wait in line for Don Memos then this is a decent option.  Most recently I had the chicken tostada.  It was a ton of food, but it didn't wow me.  The flavors are kind of bland.  I wish they didn't charge for guacamole.  It's cheap, quick Mexican style food."}
{"input": "Cookies and Canvas is one of our favorite new Saturday morning activities. My daughter has actually started a wall of paintings in our craft room. Totally recommend this for any crafty kid or adult out there."}
{"input": "Their sushi is on par with others in the area like Sushi Ninja and Sushi Maru. I always get either the Volcano, Mexican, or Yummy rolls. Can't go wrong with these choices!"}
{"input": "I love Jay's!!   It's affordable, they deliver, and it's really good, creative sushi!  Plus, the eggplant lady thing is amazing! Yes, it's true, they are not fluent in english but they know enough to take your order, and they are super friendly. I even like this place better than some of the big name sushi places!  I highly recommend!!"}
{"input": "Can't beat the price for the dixie cup filled with happiness.\n\nThe classics: Cherry, Chocolate and Pineapple flavors (all winners)\n\nIf I'm in the mood for their gelati; I get the Chocolate water ice with Rasberry ice cream.  They have off menu items such as rasberry choco chip ice cream; vanilla birthday cake; and vanilla peanut butter.  All winners.\n\nSummer is right around the corner and I'll be sitting on my stoop enjoying one of these bad boys."}
{"input": "Three stars not because of food, the food is good but, the service is slow. I think they need 1 or 2 more people up front when placing an order if your waiting and not using the kiosk to order."}
{"input": "After reading the mixed reviews I had my doubts but have to say our group of 5 was pleasantly surprised! We had made reservations, were seated promptly after a warm greeting at the door as we arrived.  \n\nOur group ordered 2 bottles of wine, both half price. I had a Chilean Syrah and found it to be very good.  It's rare to find a special like that for a decent wine, and even more rare on a Friday night!\n\nOur meals included pizza, salad, pasta. All prepared perfectly and quite tasty. \n\nOur server was friendly and efficient.  I plan to return!"}
{"input": "I've never been a huge fan of this place but my husband likes it. We went today for a late lunch and I got the hummus and pita for an app and the tossed Greek salad. The hummus was really yummy and the salad was very fresh and was a large serving. I couldn't finish it all so I took it home for tomorrow. Next time he wants to come here I know what I'll be getting - the tossed Greek salad!"}
{"input": "Foods good but don't order online for delivery. They've cancelled our orders numerous of times without due reason."}
{"input": "Great selection of mixed drinks  & beers! & a nice atmosphere :)\n\nThe customer service was 5 stars... Very Friendly! \n\nThe food wasn't the best very average - the cheese dip w/ the pretzels was funny tasting.. & the chicken asparagus was pretty bad."}
{"input": "So yummy!  We were visiting friends and craving some ice cream so I looked on yelp and found this place. We got a cookies and cream milkshake and a chocolate almond in a cone. Both were delicious. And the staff was very friendly."}
{"input": "Philippe wanted more BBQ shrimp. Not only did he get it here (with the head on!!), but he also got great gumbo-the Ya Ya-as well as excellent cocktails. The 201 drink with bourbon was divine. Martinis were a $1.50!! The service was excellent too. Places need not always be trendy and hip. Most often, simple and elegant food with good service wins!"}
{"input": "Used to love this place but the service and fish isn't what it used to. Fish didn't taste fresh  and color was pale on the maguro. Shrimp wasn't deveined and you could see the black spots on the shrimp tempura role. The red lotus continues to be a favorite and tastes great. Hopefully this place turns around, love the atmosphere and location."}
{"input": "I. Love. This. Place.\n\nIt's rather hit-or-miss, but I have picked up some lovely things here. The prices are reasonable despite what another reviewer thinks-- this is not a thrift shop. (If you want those kind of prices then check out Pelican Thrift)\nOn our recent visit to the Magazine Antique Mall I got an unusual-looking Homer Laughlin serving plate for $38 which is gorgeous; previously I got a vintage tablecloth in excellent condition for around $30.\n\nThere's something for everyone here and the staff wrapped my purchase up securely when I said I'd be packing it in my luggage."}
{"input": "Don't waste your time or money! They can never get an order right, they are slow and most of the kids that work there are rude!"}
{"input": "Sales: my experience was ok. The salesman I worked with was a complete fool, but some of the other salesmen were not too bad. \n\nService: so so. Avoid service manager Rick & you will be better off."}
{"input": "I love this salon!  They are so friendly! There nail polish selection is insane especially for gel! There spa pedicure is unlike any other salon! Kym does a great job!"}
{"input": "We don't eat at KFC very often. I had the lame idea of trying it again. First off, the cashier, Michelle, had a SERIOUS attitude problem. Rude as the day is long. No smile, no hello, no thank you. Looked like she really hated her job. We told her our food was dine-in. It was put in a to go bag, no plates, butter, sporks, etc. I didn't dare ask for plates. Chicken was under-cooked. Slaw and potatoes were OK. Biscuits fair. Are we going back? NOPE!!! Bad attitudes don't fare well with me."}
{"input": "This hotel was fantastic. I was in town for a week, working at my company's PA office in Wayne. Great location and easy to get in and out. Hotel staff was very friendly. Room was immaculately cleaned and very spacious for just one person. Kitchenette was fully stocked with dishes, silverware, utensils, a small dishwasher and a full size fridge. Windows surrounding the king size bed were great- lots of natural light. I liked that opting out of housekeeping got me a $5 credit at the restaurant. \n\nThe pool is small but no one was there the two times I went to use the hot tub. The bar has a decent drink selection, although I was bummed they were out of mint and couldn't make a mojito (which was on the drink menu). Burger was okay. Dessert was mediocre (but free with my $5 credit, so nbd). Omelet station was a nice touch in the AM. Coffee frequently had coffee grounds in it/was very weak, but the breakfast spread overall was nice."}
{"input": "Signature is professional, responsible and well run.  The valet's take pride in their service, which is refreshing."}
{"input": "Mint is a new Vietnamese restaurant just opened. A really nice modern place. I'm big on Pho & it did not disappoint me. My favorite is the wild slider with pork belly. Must try! Great staff & bartender.."}
{"input": "So I am going to come clean here up front.  I love this place.  I love the food, the casual atmosphere and the staff is professional and welcoming.  \nThey are adjacent to my hotel every time I come to NOLA so I am here at least once per visit.  \nI wanted to step outside my comfort zone and try something else today for a late lunch but when I sat at the bar, ordered a glass of wine and was given the menu- I didnt see what I wanted ( I had seen it on the lunch menu).  I wanted oysters, as in welcome to NOLA - oysters.  They would not serve them at the bar so I drank my wine and left. \nHere I am back at LUKE for my third meal this week.  And I got those oysters. \nI also got a warm welcome, great beer and hello - happy hour!  Thank you John Besh for doing what you do.  #superstar #kingofnola"}
{"input": "Waited longer then we were told. We could not carry  our bar check to our table we were told it's easier for bartender if we just pay it separate.  Staff seemed a little overwhelmed but nice and they were working hard.  Excellent beer selection. Food was good but not much quantity and the amount if fries was comical maybe 8! And the quality was not sufficient to make up for the quantity. Our one burger was under cooked the waiter did get a new burger but then we had to wait and watch my son eat it. My second time there and they  left me with no real reason to go return."}
{"input": "We went to this restaurant after running in the Philadelphia marathon.  We had a large group (12) with us including kids (ages 10-14), parents and grandparents.   The place is very clean and looks fairly new or at least newly decorated.  The service was excellent and friendly.  The food was very good for the parents but everything was on the spicy side which was not so great for the kids and grandparents.  The lighting was very dim which was an issue for the grandparents reading the menu.  \n\nThe Veggie wings were great as were the cactus and sweet potato burritos.   The guacamole was very good although the spicy chips were a little too much.\n\nThey offer pitchers of margaritas which was great for our large group."}
{"input": "Came here for my 21st birthday dinner with my family and had a great experience! The food and drinks were to die for, but they were extremely overpriced. Even though the quality of food was good, I still don't think it was worth what we paid for. I recommend getting the lobster mac and cheese as an appetizer, it was probably the best mac and cheese I've ever eaten. At the end of the meal, they gave us some small complimentary desserts, even though we ordered a bunch of desserts to top off our meal. Had a great time, but definitely overpriced."}
{"input": "Cute place, nice servers and good food but dish sizes are waaaaay too small. I left unsatisfied. I don't like it when restaurants are cheap with portions, especially neighborly ones!"}
{"input": "Well, I think that touring St.Louis Cemetery No. 1 would have been a great experience...if we had a better tour guide. My girlfriend and I decided to include a quick stop by one of New Orleans famous cemeteries before heading to the airport only to realize that entrance to the cemetery requires accompaniment by a licensed tour guide. As such, we decided to pay $20 each to join a 45-minute tour group that would be leaving soon.\n\nA word of advice: don't do what we did. Find a tour group online with good ratings if you want to do a cemetery tour. While our tour guide seemed to be somewhat informed about the history of the cemetery, she was lacking what I would think were basic tour guide skills like having your group make circle around you so that they can actually see the subject of your narration. That aside, it was still interesting to visit this above-ground cemetery and see the future pyramid-shaped tomb of Nicolas Cage."}
{"input": "Food 5/5\nService 5/5\nAtmosphere 5/5\n\nCame for lunch buffet. \n\nTandoori chicken : flavorful, juicy (not dry from the headlamps), chicken Tikka : delicious, chili chicken  and curry chicken : both very good. \nKheer (Indian rice pudding) : tastes yummy \nNaan : fresh, soft, and stayed soft throughout meal.\n\n Service : one lady doing so much.  I didn't have to ask for water refill, she was already there. Didn't have to ask for plate to be removed, she already did it. Hard working. \n\nAtmosphere : relaxed, has music and TV that shows how they cook. And cartoons for kids too."}
{"input": "Didn't make it to the main venue, but had lunch at the Den while in town for a conference at the convention center. Good food, huge selection of beer, and the most awesome bartender in NOLA!"}
{"input": "Synopsis: Great LITTLE restaurant with friendly service, great food, and reasonable prices...\n\nFYI: Cash Only- BYOB +\n\nThe 5-6 table restaurant was clean and had friendly service. I ordered the assorted meat skewers for appetizer ...they were mild in flavor cooked to perfection...came with sweet & spicy sauce (very good). Entrées were Prah-Hok Kahteeh & (forget the name) Beef with pineapples, peppers, and onions...both were great...reminds me a bit of Vietnamese food but definitely had its own unique flavors...I would recommend to anyone that likes tasty food especially Southeast Asian cuisine."}
{"input": "I had numerous things happen during my move and required additional services from this office. The guys in this office are top notch and are very trustworthy. I'd say more about how they took great care of me, but they may have gone above and beyond what they should have and afraid to say too much. I would recommend this office to my mother!"}
{"input": "Last Friday we met two friends at Abel's Authentic Mexican Cuisine located in Verdi, NV.  We enjoy Mexican food and really looked forward to trying out a new place we had never been to before.  Overall the food was good.  The salsa was fair.  However, the service was a horrible disaster.  When the waiter brought the wrong dish to my wife, he started arguing with her saying \"that is what you ordered!\"  We (all four of us) told him that it was NOT what she ordered and he appeared angry, took the dish back and forcefully tossed/dropped it on a tray at the side of the table and stomped off.  He brought back the correct order 10 minutes later; however, his behavior really ruined the experience.  Very disappointing."}
{"input": "Both the woman who did my pedicure and the woman who did my massage where very nice, but for the price I paid for each it was not worth it!  The pedicure was $50 and it's equal to an express pedicure at other salons. Very disappointing. The massage was ok. But I would never ever return:("}
{"input": "Pet Pals is where we take our dog and 2 cats, and the level of care is unsurpassed! Dr Towle and her team are knowledgeable and always provide wonderful care and try to accommodate their patients as much as possible. I love the fact that they use the holistic approach as the first step whenever possible. Dr Towle is very compassionate, especially when I had to have my loving 14 yr old kitty put down, due to advanced, debilitating kidney disease. She made the road, easier to bare!"}
{"input": "Diner food does not get any better than this!!!! Came here because I had been here before and loved it. This time I had the senior Meat Loaf. It came with 2 sides and the waitress let me have the soup as a side. A great choice as it was Navy Bean soup with big old chunks of ham in it!!! Meat loaf tasted like Mom made it!! Mashed taters and 2 buttermilk drop biscuits made this a scrumptious dinner!!!! I must eat healthy the rest of the week!!!!!! I love this place. Good thing it is in Tampa is for a treat now and then!!!!!!!"}
{"input": "Kudos to this place for providing a much needed late night snack while I was visiting Nashville! Didn't have to wait on delivery because they allowed pick-up at 2 AM! Pizza honestly looked like it wasn't going to be all that great but LOOKS WERE DECEIVING! The pizza was delicious and my only regret was that I didn't order a bigger one!"}
{"input": "I was in town for a short visit and decided to do some neighborhood exploration. I was in the garden district and wanted some cheap(er) lunch options. I found this place, had sliders and fries. I think both were very good (especially their chicken sliders). But there is more: the doughnuts. They are so so good: doughy perfectly pillowy and fresh. the flavor combinations are neat, creative. one last thing too: service is great. really helpful and nice staff."}
{"input": "In response to Doug F. who posted a review just about an hour ago....My husband and I were sitting right above you and your belligerent wife while she screamed in the manager's face, slurring her words and threatening to post poor reviews all over social media. We loved the dinnertime entertainment and the manager comped us nearly $20 off our meal because of the scene your wife caused.... and in front of your children no less. It was great and our meal was absolutely amazing. The service was great, the view was fantastic and the food was delicious."}
{"input": "I only got my eyebrows waxed but wow! Core took great care of me. She spent a lot of time, waxing, trimming and making sure everything was perfect. \n\nWhen I found out it was just $8 I was shocked. I also saw a gentleman getting his beard trimmed and the detail there was the same. Hope to go back for a haircut while I'm in town."}
{"input": "Great place for a large gathering. I was there for a private party and they have a great space for it. The cocktail menu is very good, and the good is great - would reccomend the black forest chocolate cake if you like chocolate."}
{"input": "Always delicious food and great service!! A+ The owner is a delight and really cares about his customers and food that is served. So glad he opened in Land O Lakes!!"}
{"input": "This is by far the best place in town to get a burger and enjoy a great atmosphere! My husband and I come here at least 4 times a month! The quinoa fritters are our fav and the happy hour is awesome! Totally worth it!"}
{"input": "Simply delicious and worth the wait. Not a super fan of their bacon, it tastes like cheap meat, but EVERYTHING ELSE is awesome. This most recent visit I had the Migas and it was fantastic. This is one of the best breakfast joints in town! \n\nThe ambience is fun and the service is good too!"}
{"input": "I cannot even believe someone gave this place one star. Here's the scoop. They have the BEST cannoli in the city. Termini's are no where NEAR as good, and Isgro's is far too hyped up for the quality. Potito's is my go to for cannoli, i wouldn't even THINK about going anywhere else. I'm there every xmas eve, and will be for the rest of my days. I stood in line for isgros for TWO HOURS this year for a tirimisu, i walked right into potito's and picked up my bambino cannoli stuffed cannoli. it's as good as it sounds, trust me."}
{"input": "I honestly didn't know this place existed until my friend suggested it for brunch over the weekend. I can't believe I live four blocks away and haven't been here before! I ordered the honeybee crepe and an almond croissant. I'm one to typically bring leftovers home but the food was so delicious there was nothing left to take much to the surprise of my friends. There is a small seating area downstairs and some window seating on the first floor. I'd recommend getting there on the earlier side if you're with a group and want to sit. I'd also recommend this for smaller groups. Will definitely be going back."}
{"input": "Visited friends in Philly a couple weekends ago and was very pleasantly surprised with this spot. What a quaint, cozy, speakeasy-type bar with a very knowledgeable staff. The service was impeccable and the drinks are impressive. At first, we didn't know what to order and our server (Daniel, i think) came over to hear our likes, dislikes and explained the menu and other off-menu options. All our drinks were amazing and delicious, you can tell the workmanship behind them, we had a great time! Will be back!"}
{"input": "I received flowers from an unknown source, and wanted to make sure I got a thank you to whomever sent them so called Amy's to see if they could provide more information. They weren't able to as it was ordered by a third party company, but gave me the necessary number. Great customer service! These said flowers were given to me 2 weeks ago, and they are still just as pretty as they were when I got them! Definitely will recommend and use Amy's for my future orders!"}
{"input": "My partner and I love McAlisters, but not this one! The service is horrible!! The manager leads by example- he does not seem to care that customers were waiting to place orders. He and two other employees did not acknowledge us or the other customers for at least 10 minutes. When he did he acted annoyed. The dining room was a mess, the employees were too busy engaged in their own conversations. We/I will not come back to this location. Though it is convenient we will go to the one in Creve Coeur."}
{"input": "Loved their rooms,  they are beautiful and they have comfortable beds. They have great restaurants, nice bars to hang out at and cute shopping stores. We are definitely coming back."}
{"input": "I love their rolls! :) I go here often, and I usually get a unagi and eel roll or a crunch roll. Their teriyaki chicken is really delicious too! ;-) Parking is a little difficult, I found..."}
{"input": "Very good pizza wife and I loved it so did my picky ass kids definitely will be back."}
{"input": "Wow! Great new addition to Broadway. The venue is amazing. Ate at the rooftop Lookout. Ordered almost half the menu between the five of us. Love the small plate concept, got to try and share so much. Cocktails are fabulous. Prices are extremely reasonable, especially for the quality. Service is spot on. Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu."}
{"input": "Seriously cool artisanal food. Find your way there or your culinary life will be all the poorer. Just  saying. Wish I lived in NOLA just for that."}
{"input": "Classic, old-school English pub with a fireplace, bit chairs and a great beer selection. Not just for hotel guests, this is a great place to unwind with a beverage in mid St. Louis. Very central location, lots of parking and friendly staff."}
{"input": "Came in on a Friday and the food and service was terrific. I had the cod fish special with carrots. The cobbler desert was amazing. \n\nThe interior is nice and the chairs are also super comfortable. This is my new favorite place!"}
{"input": "I've grown up in a Lebanese family and we owned a middle eastern restaurant for over 40 years. The food is everything to me. Their food and pleasentries makes me feel like I'm at my family's table. The smells bring me to sito's (grandmother's) kitchens. \nThis place is a must for truly authentic food and feel of middle eastern culture. \n\nI've tried a few in Philly, none compare."}
{"input": "This restaurant is located on the pool deck at The Vinoy Resort and open to the public.  They have indoor and outdoor service.  Outside they have tables and corn hole.  They serve lunch and dinner every day and on the weekends they have breakfast (sometimes a buffet).  They have a good selection of fruity tropical drinks and the menu has a Caribbean flare.  They have the best fish taco's I've ever eaten and use local fish.  Another favorite is the lobster quesadilla, huge chunks of lobster and you won't leave hungry even tho it is an app.  Conch fritters, chips and guac, all sorts of app's for sharing.  Black bean burger, turkey burger, cuban sandwhich . . . something for everyone from the veg head to the carnivore.  If you are looking for a unique salad try the Alfresco Salad with banana bread croutons, dried fruit and tasty dressing.  You can top with all sorts of things, but I like the scallops.  If you are downtown St Pete it is worth stopping by and they will validate your parking too.  Enjoy!"}
{"input": "Sultans Schlep did a great job on very short notice on a move of some office furniture that required timeliness and discretion. Would not hesitate to use them again."}
{"input": "Cute neighborhood and we found parking relatively easy. The prices were really affordable. I got the black and bleu and my bf got another hot beef sandwich that had peppers and onions. We both thought the sandwiches were amazing, We went around lunch time and there was a band that started playing music while we were there. Definately a good lunch spot."}
{"input": "If I could leave negative stars then I absolutely would. I waited for a long time for my pizza in a relatively empty restaurant then walked up and was handed a BURNING HOT pie that I couldn't carry. Mind you I worked in food service for 6 years and I myself would never carry a pizza that temperature. After dropping a scalding pizzas I was called \" stupid\" and then given the impression they would remake my pizza. After waiting 20 minutes, I followed up with them. The assistant manager then told me it was all my fault and I'd be lucky if I got a couple pieces. End of story is worst custom service ever!"}
{"input": "I called to get a price on getting a flat fixed $35.99WTH! Is this price legal... Smdh in a city where they don't EVEN pay livable wages.... #tragic ..smdh"}
{"input": "Went in looking for some Benjamin Moore paint colors we had picked out online - the worker worked with us to find all of the colors we had picked and then suggested similar ones to the ones that we had picked.  Great experience!"}
{"input": "I was so excited when West Elm opened! Like other reviews said, I just wish it wasn't inside of Galleria....oh well - worth it!\n\nMy boyfriend and I are re-doing our living room, and our new couch was just delivered (love you, Crate & Barrell). We stopped in to look for some accent pieces (pillow, throw, tray, etc.). We ended up finding a large tray for our ottoman. It was originally $40 but was half off then an additional 20% off today so it came out to like $16! Great deal. We also picked up a tree skirt and several ornaments which were 20% off. \n\nOur cashier was very friendly and pointed the trays out to us as we were about to check out with just the ornaments and tree skirt! So glad she did. \n\nI actually don't love how everything is organized (or not organized) in this store. I feel like it's hard to navigate. This is my only (minor) complaint."}
{"input": "I love this place. Visiting my folks in Hudson, Florida. This spot is on Hudson Beach across from the Inn at the Gulf motel and restaurant. It has seating outdoors or in with 2 bars. There are daily specials and $2 Killian Red pints all day, everyday. Usual fare for s beachfront grill and a nicely stocked souvenir shop. The top time to come is around sunset where it is an absolutely beautiful sighting. The staff is spread out pretty thin so you must be a bit patient hence 4 rather than 5 stars. If in the area, it's a must!"}
{"input": "More of a legitimate toy store (like, for children) than a toy store aimed at adults (no, not THAT kind, I mean the goofy sort with stuff that you can find in the Archie McPhee catalogue). But hey, regular toys are fun too! Puzzles, games, stuffed animals, you name it.\n\nObviously a good spot for buying gifts for the wee people in your life. Prices are a bit higher because of the \"boutique\" nature of the place. \nPoke around and get in touch with the youngster in you!"}
{"input": "Everything I have tried here has been excellent! Service is good and quick. Staff is friendly, and welcoming.  Groupon has a good deal."}
{"input": "Great service and awesome food!!!! We go here all the time. Each time it is excellent! Very very Stellar"}
{"input": "I'd like to update my review from a few years back. My how things can change. This place is now a 1-star joke. The food has gone downhill at all the restaurants. The 10 dollar parking is ridiculous (thankfully I'm an elite player so woohoo free parking) but my biggest gripe now is this \"bounce back\" play is AWFUL!! How can you truly expect someone who goes through $1000  in 2 days time to be happy with a measly $30 in free play. I plan on taking my mom to Fresh Harvest for her birthday and after that, you will NOT see me anymore. I'd rather drive to Immokalee or to the East Coast"}
{"input": "Came here to print copies of my grandpa's memorial service pamphlets and was pleasantly surprised at the service and prices. Dylan was knowledgeable and super helpful at formatting and printing the pamphlets perfectly centered and crisply colored. The prices were very competitive and I would come here all the time if I lived in the state. Definitely recommend to anyone for printing and packing/mailing services. Thanks Dylan!"}
{"input": "All you can eat lobsters.. $54.00. A steal of a deal... I had 10... $5.40 a lobster.,... . cooked to perfection!!!"}
{"input": "Nice staff, but the last two visits i've made here they have been unable to serve shakes. I understand things happen, but two times in a row? They didn't tell me this before starting my order either times. The first time they didn't even take my order for 15 minutes as I sat at the speaker. The manager, Patrick, was very apologetic about the situation and offered me two free shakes on my next visit. Wondering if ill ever be able to redeem them!"}
{"input": "This was probably the most dive type bar we visited this past weekend for our girls trip in Nashville but I tend to like smaller bars so I really enjoyed my time! \n\nWe stayed downstairs because 1. we wanted to hear the extremely talented band & 2. because upstairs felt about 20 degrees hotter. But overall the experience was very fun & relaxed.\n\nThe only suggestion would be to go with a smaller group because it felt smaller than the other bars we had been visiting so it was hard to find a spot for all 9 of us."}
{"input": "Overpriced but hey their in the KOP Mall and everything is higher at least the service is pleasant. I enjoy the DC Chicken and tomato soup. I've been there a few times."}
{"input": "Good BBQ!  Definitely more of an upscale type of BBQ...ribs were the best choice!"}
{"input": "I really enjoy coming here for dinner.  The service is great and the food is spectacular.  I always feel like I get my monies worth here."}
{"input": "My boyfriend took me here for lunch when I was craving some home cooked food (my mom was from NY and always made great Italian food) I walked in and right away it smelled DELICIOUS! Nino was behind the counter, as adorable as ever, and after looking at the lunch specials I just had to have it, so I did. While my boyfriend was waiting for his calzone, he gave us a plate of sausages with red sauce. I had a baked ziti (but with mini shells) and chicken marsala and oh my god. I want to come here tomorrow, and the next day. \n\nThe food just gave me a big warm hug and sent me on my way with a \"Ciao!\" out the door."}
{"input": "I'm a Barbecue judge and this ain't barbecue.  Not in Texas, not in the southeast.  Not in KC.  An earlier reviewer nailed it perfectly.  The brisket is fatty pot roast.  No evidence of smoke.  Mushy texture like long braised  meat.  My sandwich was 75 percent fat.  Big meatless chunks of fat.  Either the owner doesn't care or he's left the place in the hands of employees who don't know any better. Sorry.  But you can do much better elsewhere."}
{"input": "The service was great all around, very professional. The food is excellent in quality and to taste. \nI had a cheesteak, it was the best in the neighborhood and very good. \nBest vanilla milkshake like ever. \nI've been searching for a great pizzeria down here for the longest. Every where else everything is impossibly greasy, the food is old...blah blah. \nSalernos is far from disgusting. \nWorth every penny."}
{"input": "Appointments available as early as 7am and as late as 6pm- depending on the day of the week.\nNo one likes the dentist, which makes them a little difficult to review. However, I have been going to Friendly Smiles for years and am always satisfied. They work to accommodate your schedule, they have friendly staff and they have great amenities to make your visit as comfortable as possible. The Dentist's name is Dr. Smiley- you can't get much better than that in a dentist!"}
{"input": "Excellent gelato and sorbets.  You NEED to try this!  Conveniently located on the way back from the beach or after a trip to the Taco Bus."}
{"input": "It's been quite some time since I first reviewed New Day Meadery, and I can honestly say the experience here is the same if not better than even a few years ago. Brett and Tia are possibly the coolest entrepreneurial couple I know, and the pride in their craft certainly shows in the product.\n\nWe recently hit up their anniversary bottle release of gin barrel-aged Shelby Blue Ribbon, for which my wife and I were first in line. Naturally we purchased the maximum amount of bottles of this special elixir, as I believe it was approximately 3 years ago when this was last available.\n\nNew Day is truly one of the cornerstones of Fountain Square, and if you haven't stopped there yet, you haven't fully experienced Fountain Square."}
{"input": "During the parents' visit,  dad wanted some southern food. We tried Willie Maes, but the line was long and they weren't crazy about the area.  So we waited a bit and went down to The Praline Connection. Dad was in heaven. He's been talking about the food since we left. Dad got the taste of soul platter pictured below. He said the fried chicken was the best he's had and he had not tasted red beans and rice like that since he was a kid and my granny used to make em. Mom got the meatloaf with cabbage and lima beans. I got the ribs with potato salad and mac and cheese. My ribs were good but hard to cut the meat off the bone. I could've ate em with my hands but I didn't want a BBQ face. The potato salad was good but my mac & cheese was a little bland. The cornbread was great.  I'm going back next time for the fried chicken!"}
{"input": "Great people great ice cream Patricia makes the ice cream from scratch.... make sure you check it out"}
{"input": "I'm not much of a fan of modern mainstream country music but I like a lot of older stuff and love the blues. The band that was playing here today was perfect for me banging out a mix of electric blues, southern rock, bluegrass and everything in between. Assuming this is the type of band that normally plays here (and the vibe and decor here tells me it is) this would be a great spot in Nashville for those more into outlaw/alt country. Only bummer is that the beer and alcohol selection is a bit Spartan and generic; I asked for a local whiskey and was told all they had was Jack Daniels or one called Old Hickory (which is what I went with). Apparently they only have bottles for beer and it looks like only bud or corona."}
{"input": "This is simply the best Asian food available in Reno, period！Best traditional Chinese dish flavors.  But if you dont like oily pan fried food, tell them put less oil or much less oil.  The reception lady remember my wife when we went back to order after almost a year！！！ We lived in Daly City and we go there and eat there in Reno at least once.  They're good！Take my word for it.  IF NOT, well, nothing I can do so there 。。。"}
{"input": "I wanted to love this place.  I love the location.  I love Garces' stuff.  I went with another couple and none of our food was very good.  The cauliflower and burrata were decent appetizers.  The tuna pasta was sent back.  I got a salad which was ok and my date got the rabbit dish which was pretty small.  Nobody was excited about their food.  Will try again but disappointed to say the least...."}
{"input": "It's adjacent to a gas station and your view is of Fedex trucks, but the food is bright, delicious and well proportioned. I've been hoping to find a spot like this in Reno for a long time. Had the tacos (fish, shrimp, carve asada) and the Burrito Suizo. Loved them all."}
{"input": "I am a novice when it comes to Korean food, but wanted to try something new. My son and I stopped in after the gym, we were greeted and seated immediately, offered drinks then left to choose from the menu. We ordered fried dumplings and two soup dishes. When the dumplings arrived they were accompanied by an array of side plates which were all  good ,the dumplings were not what I expected but deep fried and delicious. Now to the soup,I ordered chicken with noodles and vegetables my son ordered a spicy beef and vegetables soup. Mine came in the largest bowl I have ever seen the noodles tasted freshly made the dish was excellent. We both enjoyed our meals and wouldn't hesitate to come back. Two dishes and dumplings 36 bucks not bad"}
{"input": "AMAZING Brunch spot in Tucson! The service was great as well as the food, I will definently be going back."}
{"input": "Enjoyed our meals here.  The service was great and the Sangria's are the best in town!  My husband had the all time favorite spaghetti and meatballs and I filled up on their amazing Chicken Alfredo Your Way and I added shrimp which were succulent and huge.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to those who like a smaller environment with personal service.  They were very busy for Mother's Day but the service was great and it did not take long for our food to arrive.  They were certainly prepared for the day and they even gave all Mothers a fresh cut red rose.  Excellent food, great service and wonderful environment."}
{"input": "Good food--loved the gnocchi with marinara\nthe baked eggplant appetizer was very good too\n\nThe service was very slow, but despite this, I'd go back, the food is just that good"}
{"input": "The enfrijoladaa are probably the best things I've ever eaten, period. Highly recommended. The competition next door is about as deep as you can get (la muada cafe) and yet I still keep coming back here.\n\nI'd recommend frequent visits until you've gotten through the entire menu. True gem."}
{"input": "By far the best deli I have ever been to in the US. YEP, the US. Lots of crazy choices and oh it is hard to pick!! The Muffalata is so big 4 people can share. It is so tasty and amazing! Go on Saturday or Thursday night when they have live music! The special is always a good pick and don't worry there are plenty of sides to choose from. Great Chili, potato salad and of course chips. GO NOW..."}
{"input": "I have been here a couple of times before and have never been that impressed, but I thought I'd give it another try.\n\nI ordered grilled salmon and bugolgi to take home last night. The salmon was dried out to the point of leather. The bugolgi was the absolute worst I've ever tasted. I would have thrown it all in the trash but the fridge and cupboards were bare. \n\nWe will never eat here again."}
{"input": "Charles is gold. Exactly as he said \"a job done right is done the first time\".  Had worked with him a few times. Very good and trustworthy."}
{"input": "This is the best tortilla soup I've ever eaten!!  This is going to sound strange but I actually crave their chips and salsa.  The restaurant is always clean, waitstaff is always friendly, and the food is always good!  Worth the trip!"}
{"input": "I think that the Outback in Wayne is unusually good.  We probably eat there at least once a month.  The service is perfectly adequate and so is the food.  We've been there with our grandchildren and the wait staff has always been very accommodating.  Its not a five star white tablecloth restaurant.  If you go there expecting that you will disappointed."}
{"input": "Amazing. Ham Dynasty is an interesting execution of really good Asian food. It's \"family style\" which means they bring each dish out as soon as it's ready and you're supposed to share. And when they say \"as soon as it's ready\" they mean within 5 minutes of your order. We were amazed at how fast the food came out, and our server was extremely nice and helpful. The menu also has helpful numbers to indicate how spicy each dish is going to be. \nWe had a few different dishes for the table, and polished them all off, because we loved almost everything we ordered. \nThis place is really a tremendous dining experience."}
{"input": "The service was fast and the soup and salad was up to standards. Can't say anything about entrees since we didn't order any, but the do have a variety."}
{"input": "was here twice -- first for a nightcap at the bar -- the drinks really were some good stuff and i tried a the lemon hummus and pita -- that was the best hummus ive ever had!\n\nthe next morning we came in for brunch, which was pretty much terrible. first of all, it took us 45 minutes to get our food for brunch....and it came out cold and we found a hair. the manager did comp our check though. overall, the bar is great, but i would skip breakfast. what a disappointment for a kimpton restaurant."}
{"input": "Just about to get tucked into a meatloaf that is smelling amazing and about to get devoured."}

{"input": "So many wonderful choices on the menu made it hard to pick. We choose the Fruit & Yogurt Power Jar along with the Chicken Biscuit with City Grits. The food was very good, we had great service from Linda and I was amazed how clean the kitchen was since I got a good view whenever the enter door opened.u"}
{"input": "Walked for what felt like an eternity down to the wharf because my BF claimed to have had the best clam chowder in his life here. Oh-em-gee he was right. BEST clam chowder EVER. We also got the coconut shrimp and the shrimp ceviche. These plates were meh. The ceviche wasn't a true ceviche since the shrimp wasn't actually \"cooked\" in lime. It felt more like a salad. Coconut shrimp was better but the accompanying fries and coleslaw was below average."}
{"input": "Last night we had a fabulous dinner! The food is very authentic and wonderful. This restaurant is extremely special. The waitstaff couldn't be sweeter or more attentive. Yoichi's is a gem!"}
{"input": "Christian is an amazing trainer! He listens, is dedicated to his clients, compassionate, and is just a really great guy!   He is professional and will help you accomplish any goal you set your mind to. I highly recommend him to anyone looking for a top notch trainer!"}
{"input": "Such a fun atmosphere and fun for all ages! Love this place! Great for family fun, or in the late hours good adult comedy."}
{"input": "This is definitely a different kind of store. The theme that washes over you when you walk in the door is gothic and it really keeps in tune with this theme throughout the store.\n\nI am not, nor have I ever been, a goth but I have been to this store on a couple different occasions. This place is packed with everything from clothing to accessories to books to incense.\n\nI have purchased incense as well as books from here. The book collection focuses on new age stuff. The book I bought from here that I can remember was a dream book. It basically was a dictionary for your dreams and you could look up aspects of your dream and see what it means in your real life. It is really fun.\n\nIf you like gothic punk style, check this place out. Chances are if you are a true goth, you already have!"}
{"input": "I have been a snowbird from Illinois for the past 5 years and now we moved here permanently. I wasn't able to get a good pedicure all the time I was coming down here to St. Pete Beach until now. I tried Alyssa Salon and Debbie did my pedicure. She gave me the best pedicure I ever had! She's very thorough and very good at giving pedicures. The salon is a very welcoming place and everyone is so friendly from the minute you walk into the place.  I am ecstatic that I found a great pedicurist!  \nI also had my hair done 2 weeks later by Lynda Scillitani and she is a fantastic stylist. She's also an expert in hair coloring. She mixed a color for my hair that was perfect. It's like my natural color. This salon is a beach treasure. I am so happy with Alyssa's Salon and will tell my friends."}
{"input": "If you have not had their cream filled donuts then you simply have not lived, my friend! Incredible! I came to Philly to visit my sister and she brought us here on our second to last day. The cream filled doughnut was so incredible that I drove all the way back here on our way home to get a half dozen of them for the drive back to Michigan! And if you're wondering...yes, yes I crushed all 6 of those delicious pieces of heaven and I won't apologize for it!"}
{"input": "Very much enjoyed this meal. The restaurant is nice and spacious, great views and on golf course. \n\nThe appetizers were good, not great. We got the pull-away rolls which were very nice when they came out warm. The spinach artichoke dip was also good, a little different than you get at most places. \n\nThe burger was excellent. I built my own with pretzel bun, bacon, onions and mushrooms. The fries and the onion rings were terrific. \n\nThe cookie skillet was a very nice ending, great cookie. It was my birthday and the server took a Polaroid and gave it to us in a nice card- it was a nice touch!"}
{"input": "From the first step you take in the door this place is top notch! Clean shop, really professional and personable barbers! This was my first time here and got my hair cut by Ish and I have absolutely zero complaints the man knows his stuff and makes sure your cut is perfect! I will definitely be back!"}
{"input": "what to do on a snowy day in philly?  go to tria!  this place is wonderful - the food is delicious, the drink list is great and the service is pleasant.  i can't comment on the atmosphere, because i was there at noon during a snowstorm, so no one else was in sight...  but, the smoked chicken panino and the banana caramel desert panino are SOO good."}
{"input": "I was very surprised to find that others had had such a less than satisfactory experience at Toyota of Santa Barbara. David Zuniga and sales associate Mikey were both friendly, honest, and accommodating with my car search. I had been looking for sometime at nearly every dealership new, used and otherwise in Santa Barbara County for over a month. Both David and Mikey went above and beyond to help me find the perfect fit. Something that I did not find at ANY other dealership in town. I can not speak for other staff at the dealership as I worked exclusively with them but I can imagine with the level of customer service that David and Mikey provided is the standard at Toyota Santa Barbara, anyone looking to get a new, used, or leased vehicle should seriously consider making your way to Toyota of Santa Barbara."}
{"input": "I really enjoy this theater! It is always clean and the staff is always friendly. the reason I am giving them for star in that V is because they haven't done some of the necessary updates that other theaters have done by updating the seating offering wait staff service excetera. You can go to the Roadhouse theater for $11 with a student discount or 12 bucks, which is all required liners and heated seats and they have wait staff with a chef. The pricing is nearly the same at this theater but it doesn't have all the same perks. I believe they may have one or two theaters with upgraded seats but they really need to go through the entire theater and update it."}
{"input": "This place should be on Restaurant Impossible. It's run down, the decor is tacky, beaten up, miss-matched and cheap. It's really dark...probably to hide how dingy it is. Everything was sticky. I ordered a burger medium and got a charred, tasteless hockey puck. My mom and aunt got the baked crab soup, which before we ordered, we misheard each other and called it baked crap soup. It turned out to be a better description. The crab stuffed mushrooms were heavy on the stuff and light on the crab.  The servers were super nice though."}
{"input": "5 stars on the beignets.  3 huge beignets for $2.69.  I'm not really sure why each batch needs 1 pound of powdered sugar, but no matter it was delicious fresh out of the fryer. I eat beignets at cafe du monde, but glancing at cafe du monde's, they are $0.50 more, but a lot bigger per order.  And there's not a 1 hour line at cafe beignet like there is a cafe du monde.  We went there twice in once day!"}
{"input": "Surprisingly good.  Had the grouper fish fry on a Friday night which was unlimited fish.  It was good.  Husband had buffalo chicken sandwich which he liked.  Kids at free as we were staying at hotel.  Ate there for breakfast which omelet was simple but was really good as well."}
{"input": "My hubby and I ate here (on our second visit) last Friday night before checking out Anthony Bourdain at the Fox.  We both ordered salads which arrived quickly, were nicely proportioned, and were pretty darn tasty.  We split a funghi pizza which was decent - a nice change of pace from the deep dish at Pi and the crappy delivered stuff - but I wouldn't call it great.  The service was good, but again not great, as it was on our first visit.  \n\nFor me, the draw of this place is the laid-back atmosphere.  We sat outside, had a couple of brewskis, and enjoyed a nice meal at a reasonable price.  I wouldn't choose this place to impress guests from out of town, but I will certainly return for a fun and low-key start to an evening out."}
{"input": "This salon is filthy.  There are cobwebs and dust every where.  The equipment is old and in disrepair.  My nail technician was actually watching you tube videos while doing my nails!  I do not know how the health department hasn't shut them down."}
{"input": "Scheduled a consult with this firm, was 20 minutes late. Thank god it was just a phone consult. Receptionist was rude and didn't seem to value my time. No apology was given for the tardiness. Told her that i was going to look elsewhere and she said ok and hung up. \n\nMaybe they don't care about clients for traffic tickets. If i had been given an apology or felt like they actually cared, i would have continued with them. \n\nLet's see if they respond to this review."}
{"input": "I dropped my car off first thing in the morning for a simple \"check engine\" light appointment. I was told at the end of that day that my car had not been looked at and would not be ready until the following day. What was the point of making an appointment, if they didn't even touch my car? The next evening when I came to pick it up, after they called me to tell me it was ready, I waited for a full hour before my car was given to me. They had parked so many cars in front of it they couldn't get it out. That is an hour of my life I will never get back, all because someone called and told me to come pick up my car (...which was there for two full business days, unnecessarily. For the record, there was nothing wrong with the car. It needed no repair and no maintenance). There was a kind woman who asked how they could make it up to me, but I had to tell her that I will likely never return, so it wasn't worth her time."}
{"input": "I like this place & will probably be back just for the bacon greased popcorn. Great beer too. Girlfriend and I stopped by for lunch one day and ordered the fried chicken and the duck sandwich. The duck was a solid dish. The chicken, however, is what drops this from 4 to 3 stars. Skimpy pieces of chicken with not a ton of flavor. Nice, crispy skin though. Mac n cheese was average. Bacon grease popcorn was the star."}
{"input": "The dark chocolate sorbetto is an absolute miracle. I don't know how something so creamy can possibly be dairy-free. It is, hands-down, the best dark chocolate sorbet I've ever had. Top it with their to-die-for peanut butter sauce and, well, deliciousness overload. \n\nI've also had the gelato and it's always really good, the hubs particularly likes the chocolate hazelnut gelato. The cookies are also very good, especially the ricotta cookies. And the employees are all so friendly! I was initially sad when What's the Scoop left, but I really love this place."}
{"input": "This place is terrible. They wouldn't serve me because of the color of my skin. We ended up waiting for our shitball ass food for 2 hours and one 8 oz drink took us 45 minutes. Very polite and courteous waiter though"}
{"input": "The food is EXCELLENT!!!! You order at the counter and then go sit down. They bring you your good and they are FAST!! My fiance order the chicken gyro and I order the beef kabob.  The plates are HUGE!!"}
{"input": "Capital beer definitely fills a void that's been missing in Fishtown. When you're in the moody for typical Chinese take out now you can look no further than capital beer. \n\nWe ordered egg rolls, veggie fried rice, Kung pao chicken, and beef Szechuan. Egg rolls were ON POINT. Perfectly fried and crispy. Fried rice was pretty standard and both of the entrees were nicely spiced and pretty much what one would expect from a Chinese takeout place. \n\nWe took out our food but the restaurant looked clean and inviting. We will definitely come back and try the sushi!"}
{"input": "I'm 100% biased to any Giordano's location that provides the same flavor and experience I'm used to growing up in Illinois.  This location checked enough boxes to make me happy.  The service was friendly and informative.  The fried cheese curds were on point.  The \"meat and more meat\" pizza was FANTASTIC.  I don't plan to be in Indianapolis at this location ever again but if it's an option, Imma take it in a heartbeat."}
{"input": "Went here with my wife for lunch. I had the crab cakes and my wife had the boardwalk shrimp. We had the hush puppies as an appetizer. All the food was pretty good. They know how to salt properly (too many places over salt their foods). Good portions, good service. The decor is very much like something from the shore with a marlin, boats, nets, etc on the walls. They were out of Margarita mix and one of the owners (I believe) apologized later. Cheap beer is also available. Probably one of the best seafood places in the area."}
{"input": "Best tacos in Tucson hands down. If i want tacos i must go here. They just opened another location in the park place mall and i love it! Worth the money"}
{"input": "Nope nope and nope again\nRude hostess \nAlways some nonesense with seating and sushi is mediocre at best... \nyes it's dirt cheap but it's also dirt food & dirt service \nOh the kicker - ginger smells like amonia\nGave this place a couple tries \nNever again"}
{"input": "Absolutely love this place! I arrived right before they opened (sorry!) at like 950. The woman (I think the owner) was so nice and had great energy! I got a spicy tuna bowl, and a juice and both were amazing! And the bowl was substantial for a size small. This place is definitely a cute little hidden gem. It's drive through only which I kinda like! It was a little difficult maneuvering my car but worth it. Definitely will be back to try an açaí bowl!"}
{"input": "This is my second time at Buena Onda, and I'm ordering my favorite dish--the Mahi Mahi tacos. I live in California where there are plenty of Fresh Mex restaurants, but Buena Onda has the best tasting fish tacos hands down. The fish is lightly grilled, moist and seasoned just right wrapped in fresh tortillas, garnished with pickled relish and small thin slices of avocado. The tacos are served in a taco holder which makes it easier to pick up and relish every bite! The restaurant itself is bright and clean, quick service and friendly staff. There are other menu options besides fish and the prices are cheap--fish tacos are at $3.50 per order."}
{"input": "Branched out passed manayunk and roxborough to East Falls for some pizza.  Got the family special of large pizza, buffalo chicken cheesesteak and wings with a 2 liter.\nThe pizza itself was better than average.  There was a good amount of cheese on the pie.  The sauce was tasty and well seasoned.  It seemed like it had a hint of anchovies in the sauce.  Either that or garlic.  The wings were excellent top notch.  Very hot even though it was take out which was hard to do.  With several flavors to choose from we got the naked honey BBQ.  Thy were meaty and massive.  I def would return for the wings.  A good sign upon walking in were the empty boxes of liscios rolls outside.  The roll of course was fresh and soft while the chicken was chopped breast meat with a spicy hot sauce and Gorgonzola.  Good sandwhich but not overfilling."}
{"input": "Needed a battery for my Lexus.  Drove over to AutoZone in Roxborough at 9 am Sunday morning.  Easy transaction, had the new battery installed within minutes!  Thank you for getting my car back on the road again!"}
{"input": "Well, I must say I was HIGHLY IMPRESSED by Bailey's Range.  The menu, specifically, was most impressive.  It was very hard to decide what to get, cause everything looked great!!  \nThe server was very friendly, prompt, and attentive.  \nThe food tasted fantastic, and was cooked just as we ordered it.\nThe two reasons I didn't give five stars:  \nFirst - The burgers were a little smallish for their price.  If I'm paying $10 for a burger, I want something substantial, and I found the amount of meat a little lacking.\nSecond - While I realize that there are only so many cooks for so many people (cause the place was pretty crowded), it did take like 45 minutes for our burgers to be ready; and, while I understand that these are gourmet burgers with all sorts of special  ingredients... bottom line is I think that the amount of time it takes meat to cook is sort of universal, and burgers should be a little quicker than that."}
{"input": "Most of the time I go through the drive thru here.  While sometimes the line is a bit long I have to say these guys move in record time.  The line moves fast and my coffee is waiting for me when I get to the window.  How much more can you ask for? \n\nInside there is a decent amount of seating and there is quite a bit of outdoor seating too.  Overall this is a great Starbucks."}
{"input": "There is no help in the appliance section. If you do receive help they don't know what they are talking about. Bad service. Sears home Appliance store in Springfield is definitely a better option if you're looking to get great prices and great service"}
{"input": "Outback is a backup steak shop.\nThey have pretty decent food, if you order the right thing.\nTheir steaks (filet) is pretty good, yet pricey.  Not always cooked to order.\nThe green beans are always great, but they get so cold so fast.\nTheir salads are really good, always fresh, crisp lettuce.  I like the tangy tomato dressing since they don't have catalina or french.\nWe get take out from there instead of eating in, the parking lot is insane and the take out is just as good as table service."}
{"input": "First time here and I'm not disappointed. Great seasoning on the seafood. I ordered oysters and their $45 combo and some garlic chicken wings for a family of six. It was more than enough for us. Only thing I can complain about is she messed up on our order."}
{"input": "Great spot to watch some sports and grab a 312 beer. Pizza takes a little longer, but it's worth it. The people are always nice, and they have deals when the Bears play. Also I like that they have bar level tables, not just a bar then tables. Bar isn't huge, but stools are comfy."}
{"input": "This place is always there for me when I need a pick me up. The coffee is great (as great as convenience store coffee can be!) and there's always an energy drink of sorts on sale. You can find a decent lunch in a pinch as well, the vegetarian/vegan section has some good finds and the chicken tenders are surprisingly good and inexpensive. The staff is always friendly and more than willing to help you or grab what you want if it's not on the shelf. As much as I love & miss Wawa, I am thankful for a nice, clean, friendly place to grab caffeine close to my work."}
{"input": "Wahoo's is a California staple in my opinion. Back in San Diego, my hometown, Wahoo's defines Baja cuisine. With amazing soft, grilled fish tacos, served alongside white rice and the best cajun beans on the West Coast, Wahoo's is sure to please. I recently had the Pork bowl, a hearty serving of the rice and beans topped with delicious slow-cooked carnitas: a definite repeat. There isn't much more to say about Wahoo's except that I will always be going back."}
{"input": "Excellent food and service. I had a Salmon and my friends a Burger. Sloan was our waitress and advised us from beers, wine all the way to our full meal. There was a two piece band that was a nice addition. This is a must for anyone. \nBonnie from San Diego"}
{"input": "I worked with the Sultans of Schlep last week on a small move within center city. I had a great experience for a number of reasons:\n\n-Tom is extremely attentive, responsive, and easy to work with\n-They have fair prices\n-The movers were on time and worked efficiently\n-They provided wardrobe boxes at no extra cost\n-They have a cool and funny name (don't you think?)\n\nI would definitely work with them again!"}

{"input": "Dr. Fox has a phenomenal bedside manner.  He is so genuine and kind, but also knowledgeable.  He helps explain things in terms his patients can understand and relate to, but not in a condescending way.  When I went to him I was so upset with a chronic illness I had, I felt really depressed over it.  But Dr. Fox helped explain it and put it into perspective, and had an optimistic outlook on my treatment and I immediately felt better.  Here I am six years later feeling much better, thanks to his guidance!"}

{"input": "If you're looking for some good tasty barbecue....this place isn't it. Ribs seem to be cooked in a pan and heavy smothered in a bbq type sauce. Pulled pork was just blah and comparable to Whitt's bbq. They do however have really good catfish and burgers.  Pretty generous portion of fish and sides. Mac n cheese is tasty and creamy. I don't believe I've ever had a bad side dish from here. I would tell you about dessert but I'm always so full from dinner. Be prepared to wait on any day and at anytime you come here. There is always a line and as other reviews stated they only take cash or check. Staff is friendly and helpful. Place could be cleaned a little more but it's what you'd expect from a small bbq joint."}
{"input": "To the point,\n\nI go to this Bruegger's everyday as it it close from where I work and I would like to point a few things out as reference for anyone that is thinking of going for breakfast or lunch.\n\n-Soups, Saladas and Sandwiches are great. (And fast)\n-Bagels and cream cheese variety and selection are amazing (specially if you go early in the morning)\n-Staff is nice, friendly, attentive and if they ask you \"How are you doing\" there's a genuine tone to the sentence.\n\nI am writing this today because I had an incident with my card (I forgot it) and because I go pretty often, I still got my order with a little note (Geovana will pay such and such tomorrow) and I did. Because of the nice staff I didn't have to leave hungry and embarrassed.  \n\nGreat food, great staff, great experience."}
{"input": "so bummed! \nwe ordered our favorite cheese steaks from Wimpy's on Thursday (3/17). While the meat, peppers and onions were to usual standards(yummy)...the bun was AWFUL!!!! Part of the whole Philly cheese steak mystique is that the roll adds to the whole experience. The new roll is a wicked, cheap, flavorless wrapping. It REALLY takes away from the rest of the sandwich....Did they also change the great bun on the burger, too? Gotta find a better  source for cheese steaks in Delco. So sad!"}
{"input": "Stopped in for dinner alone while taking a break from work.  Ordered wings for an appitizer and fish tacos for an entree.  The wings were over cooked and very difficult to eat.  The fish tacos were good.  The prices are thoroughly unreasonable, especially for the atmosphere and quality of food.  Frankly, don't really know how they're so busy.   Would not return."}
{"input": "I have been going to this studio for almost four years and have been quite satisfied with it. They offer a variety of classes including yoga, pilates, zumba and many more. I go here mostly for yoga and I think the teachers are fantastic. The Saturday morning class with Kim Kaplan is one of the best. My only suggestion is that some of the yoga teachers could use a wider variety of poses. There are so many out there! Overall, a great studio."}
{"input": "I really can't say enough about Susanna Foo. I had heard mediocre things but the place blew me away. Everything on the menu looked good and we licked every plate clean. Start with the dim sum style dumplings and don't skimp. We didn't have enough. The light, fresh, fusion twists on Chinese classics are amazing. We also downed the desserts which though not as good as the main course were pretty darn good."}
{"input": "Never had Malaysian food before eating here, but it's extremely good.  Roti canai was an excellent appetizer, almost better than the breads at dedicated Indian restaurants.  The noodle dishes are also delicious.  Atmosphere was great; I'll be back soon."}
{"input": "Thoroughly enjoyed our private tour today with Carrie (it was very rainy so not too many visitors).  Her knowledge and passion about the Civil War was captivating. The Battle of Franklin deserves such a memorial."}
{"input": "Hey what can I say...its pizza after being on the east coast for a while I can just say its pizza!!!! its thin crust like imos and it gives them a nice run for the money. I had a 2 topping and the toasted raviolis which both were good! I would recommend. The lil lady cooking was a sweetheart she brought everything out to the car piping hot!!!! Really cheesy and hot cheap and good!"}
{"input": "Worst chicken tenders ever!! they take 15-20mins to make them and once they are finally at your table.....they are harder than a rock. Terrible."}
{"input": "We are from out of town staying the night in Reno and we're looking for something close to our hotel. We gave Pizza Guys a try and they did not disappoint. The place was very clean and the service was outstanding. We ordered one of the deals and got 2 large pizzas, cheezee bread, and a 2 liter for $30 and easily fed my family of five which includes 2 teenagers. The pizza and breadsticks were awesome. Great crust and excellent marinara. Not to mention the premium toppings. It is not very often when you find a place with great food and great service. I would highly recommend."}
{"input": "Cockroach in my room, wifi is slower than aol in 1996, private beach costs $10 a chair. I'll never come here again."}
{"input": "Delicious red velvet cupcakes!!! Absolutely a must-go if you are in the area. Definitely going to try to make the effort to stop by whenever I'm in Philly. \n\nTried the banana pudding about 2 years ago too, and it was fantastic. Surprisingly no wait! It's a small shop with great desserts."}
{"input": "We were lucky it wasn't busy. Service was good and fast. Food was fine. We had two gumbos, one crawfish etouffee, and one spaghetti meatballs. Not super delicious but wasn't bad either. I have no complaint but am just curious about the tax they added to my receipt. Is it supposed to be 10% fixed or it varies from different areas? I know it's NOLA and everything could happen here."}
{"input": "The food definitely did not live up to my expectations! The service was good despite the long wait and huge crowd, but the food itself was subpar. I ate the lobster bisque in a bread bowl and a crab sandwich. The bisque was too tomatoey and I didn't even see and lobster chunks in it, and the bread bowl was NOT fresh. The crab sandwich was decent, but flavorless, you could hardly tell that it was crab. My mother had the lobster roll which was apparently delicious, though ridiculously overpriced at $20. The clam chowder was thick and buttery, and the bread bowl was once again stale. Overall, a very disappointing meal that was insanely overpriced. Such a bummer."}
{"input": "Good: view, breeze, weather on this day.\nBad: understaffed, picnic tables as seating, and no drink menu. I think that the incredible weather and view save this restaurant from being 2 stars. The food was \"okay\", service was slow because they needed more staff. All in all I'd come back again for a beer to watch the sunset on a nice day, but not big on dinner here."}
{"input": "We made our way to Surrey's one morning before checking out the WWII D Day museum (just a few blocks apart). \n\nThey don't take reservations and we did encounter a small line.... We were seated within 10 minutes and everything was great. \n\nTheir menu was really interesting... lots of different and things. \n\nWe were disappointed that the juice bar didn't have any oranges to make orange juice for breakfast. \n\nI had the Shrimp and Gritts... wife had their Banana's Foster French Toast, neither disappointed. \n\nI'll be back to try some of the other things... This really is a great find just outside the French Quarter! \n\nCash only too.. so plan ahead."}
{"input": "What's not to like? Raw milk, kefir, yogurt, plus farm-fresh eggs and meat.  A little expensive but you're paying for quality stuff, not over-processed garbage from a factory farm. Having grown up on a dairy farm in upstate NY, I drank only raw milk. I miss that milk; thankfully I never outgrew shaking up the milk bottle before drinking so I don't have to readjust now that I'm back on the raw milk.\n\nThey also have homemade rice pudding - amazing. So good. They also make their own ice cream. I'm guessing they're conservatives, based on the politically-charged names but whatevs. Also saw some raw honey on the shelves. If they had more stuff, I'd probably buy it."}
{"input": "Wow!  We had the most amazing food and service at Blue Fig!  The food is all freshly made.  We had the hummus and home made chips to start...highly recommend!!! They have a variety of gluten and dairy free options that are delicious. The falafel salad was the best. \n      Great to find a restaurant close by that's both healthy and affordable."}
{"input": "I really really enjoy this place,  one of my favorite places to go.  Their French onion soup... oh my word I'm craving it right now I'm only sad that they're not open for lunch I wish they were!! Coffee cured fillet is something I recommend!"}
{"input": "Been coming to Casa for 10 years. Only ate in the restaurant side twice! I am a bar guy! The best margaritas in town for the money and I have had them all over town. Bean dip is great and salsa is usually very good, although inconsistent.  Food is usually good, although also hit and miss depending on the kitchen staff on a given night. Sit at the bar and talk with long-time bartender Dave. He will keep laughing and well libated. In short,  if you are looking for decent (sometimes very good) food, great margaritas,  and a very good bartender,  this might be your spot. Zero in on one or two menu items and enjoy the drinks and company."}
{"input": "As a property manger I have used Alpine consistently for the last 4 almost 5 years for my re-keys and lock outs.  The quality and  continuity of their service is unparalleled.  I probably should admit this but after locking my keys in my car at a showing at the back of Cold Springs....on a Friday late in the afternoon the guys at Alpine came to my rescue.  I cant imagine using another locksmith.  They are great with my clients and exhibit professionalism beyond compare at evictions.  They are  my go to and will remain such for years to come."}
{"input": "Stopped in for happy hour on a Friday night. Sat at the bar with with great bartenders. Had the happy meat balls and calamari wow yum. Beautiful place and atmosphere with delish food.

{"input": "Went here with family on a vacation. We were told by the hotel it was a steakhouse. But we still were happy with the food. The guacamole was a little bland (needed more cilantro or jalapeño), but the dish I had (numero uno) was delicious. The tres leches cake was amazing! Recommend this place to anyone visiting tucson"}
{"input": "Not sure why it took until now for us to find this place. We started out going to the chain lobster restaurant but wanted something more authentic. A friend recommended Lobster Haven and I checked it out online. Looked like a type of place we would eat at in Massachusetts when we visit family. We were not disappointed! Service was great, fast and very friendly. Huge selection of all of the favorites. You have to visit this place if you want authentic New England seafood. You can also purchase live lobster and fresh seafood to go and cook it yourself."}
{"input": "All time fav pizza joint! Love the location, it's tucked away in this cute little shopping center. The pizza and service is always great. Love the marghritra, downieville and mushtacheride pizzas. (Hope I spelled those right) Eclipse is very similar to Bluemoon pizza."}
{"input": "Best pizza I have ever had! Delivery is always so fast, never waited longer that 45 minutes ! I Highly recommend this restaurant! Prices are great as well!"}
{"input": "If you go you must try the barbecue shrimp delicious!! you get about 8-10 in a special sauce you eat them with your hands and a bib if you want to stay clean. (Highly recommended) the red fish was awesome as well. Classy place best service in New Orleans they pick up the plates from your table as soon as your done eating it's like they were watching me eat freaky but great :). Go here!!"}
{"input": "There are restaurants with views and then there are views with restaurants. This belongs to the latter group. Had I known there was a view involved I would not have booked a table as the food is so often an afterthought and overpriced; this was no exception. The cooking was erratic, ranging from superb to amateurish. Fennel appetizer was sensational. Short ribs were dry and stringy and served tepid. The skate was perfect but the fettuccine lackluster. The light over our table was burned out so we ate in partial darkness which only served to highlight the short comings of the dishes. Loved the bread selection at the start and the shortbread cookies and jellies at the end were great! It's a good place for drinks and bar snacks and it feels special. If you care about the food, go elsewhere."}
{"input": "These guys are GREAT.  The coffee is delicious, the vibe is relaxed yet well put together, and the staff is friendly but not overbearing.  Go by - it's a a cool spot."}
{"input": "Start with table side guacamole! A bit sweet but delicious, smooth and creamy! Excellent! Next the Market Margarita (pineapple juice, agave nectar, cilantro and jalapeño!  Unusual. Spicy with a hint of sweetness. Very good! Chicken tacos were great.  The Carne Asada had good flavor but was not very tender.  I've had much better!  Ambiance is suitable for first date (not too dark) very open seating, casual dress OK. Music not to loud, you're able to carry on a conversion.  Also very comfortable choice for business or eating alone.  Service was excellent. Eddie my waiter, was very nice and helpful regarding the menu.  Also other waiters make sure you don't need anything. Very nice group effort in that regard. Nice outdoor seating available as well. This is a bit upscale so expect that to be reflected in prices.   And you certainly can't beat the nice touch of mini churros to go!  Highly recommended."}
{"input": "About 2 months ago I ordered a sandwich and a side of coleslaw for lunch while at work. It took about 45 minutes for delivery, less than a mile away, no big deal. I absolutely can not stand toasted. I specifically told them not toasted, and no middle slice of bread. When my order arrived the coleslaw was missing, the middle piece of bread was in it, not big deal I can take that out. The big deal was it was toasted. I called, and they offered to give me a free sandwich on a future order. Today I placed my order at 12:08. I called at 1:07 to find out where my lunch was. The lady told me it was made and sitting there. What the hell you leave a sandwich sitting there for an hour? Apparently they only have two drivers on today. I guess since it was a free order the driver did not think he was getting tipped, so I became low priority. Here it is 1:23 and still no food."}

{"input": "We booked this hotel by an undisclosed purchase on priceline.com. The rate was $55 a night for 3 nights. Make sure you have the correct La Quinta since there are two right near Busch Gardens. The other one is not very nice. This La Quinta was running about $80 a night. It was in the process of renovation. Our room was redone. The only part that was not very nice was the bathroom. It was not as clean as it could have been, and the there were cracked tiles and the tub was beat up. The pool was heated and all of the surroundings were just painted. Breakfast was Ok. It was waffles, bagels, cereal, fruit, yogurt etc. The hotel was 1.5 miles from the entrance to Busch Gardens. I drove and dropped off my family at the park and then would return to the hotel, park and would walk back. The walk was 20 minutes. Overall it was worth $80. I thought is was a great deal for $55. Great location for Busch Gardens."}

{"input": "We have been trying to find a great local spot for Breakfast and we finally found it. Great food at a great price with great service. We tried a little bit of everything and it was all delicious. I highly recommend the French toast and the crab soup."}
{"input": "Yes, it's a little pricey, but it was darned near worth it. \nIt certainly didn't seem a priority to get us our menus, but once they did, the service was pretty on point. The bread was good. I ordered a chopped salad and a crab cake, and the hub got a crab cake sandwich with fries. We had water to drink, no appetizers-walked out for $45 with tip. The food came quickly.  My food was great-and I'm no salad eater. The crab cake was quality, fries were good. \nAnother drawback is that we had to sit in the bar area bc it was after 9. The table was the size of a chair, 3 plates were too much.\n\nP.S. i used my bank card, and noticed that I was charged significantly more than I agreed to, so I called the restaurant. The manager said it's a banking glitch, and should correct itself before the money comes out of my account... It better."}

He is very passionate about the birds and it shows. He taught the kids things about parrots and at dinner time that night the kids were excited to answer questions I asked about parrots. Me. Bob made sure each kid got a feather from a bird too. It was a wonderful way to spend a couple of hours in the morning and well worth the 1.5 hour drive (1 way) to get there. We are planning another trip next spring to visit again. When your there, make sure you pet Jack the dog too."}

{"input": "We came in to Cru for wine Wednesday and had such a great time. On some Wednesdays they have wine tastings, so we were able to taste 5 different wines, mainly from the napa area, which were all excellent. We came with a group so we were also able to sample a ton of the food (we were told food is new within the last few weeks). We were blown away with the food! The orzo was Amazing, the flatbreads (fig and prosciutto, and mushroom and goat cheese) were also delicious. If you are interested in cheese pairings you can also do a platter of cheeses and italian meats to match with the wines. I'd highly recommend Cru."}
{"input": "Over priced . Every time I go there the owner works the register and changes the prices . He just guesses. Food has gone down hill the last 2 years also. I asked for sour cream an onion chips and he said he only had BBQ . Then after I payed I seen the other chips and asked for them and he was all mad. Then I asked for napkins ( they don't have them out ) and he was all mad again like I asked for his first born."}

It was 10:30 on a Sunday and we only waited 10 minutes."}

I travel extensively, spending at least 200 nights per year in hotels, with most of those being the Hilton chain.  I've come to expect a certain level of service.  The Garden Inn at Vanderbilt consistently fails to live up to even minimum expectations as have other Hilton chain hotels in the downtown area (Homewood and Doubletree).  Inept and often condescending front desk staff, awful wireless, bland surroundings and generally bad service.  My team and I will be trying a new hotel brand!"}

{"input": "I went back and forth before writing this review - but have gotten a sad meal here now three times- first we had pancakes that they didn't mix the things in and brought them out on the side after we waited 25 min, then we got almost well done burgers after asking for med rare and today I ordered French toast to go and it literally tasted like the bread from a grilled cheese. There was nothing French toast about it - it was griddle partially burned challa- completely regular bread in the middle, it didnt have a trace of egg soaked French toast flavor. it was as if they took the bread out of the bag and stuck it on  a greasy  fry top with whatever they used- threw the whole thing in the trash after two bites."}
{"input": "I've been on the Natchez twice this year.  Once doing the dinner cruise (which is overpriced in my opnion but has very good bread pudding) and once without.  I feel like if you paid that much money to go on the paddlewheel that you probably should eat before and that way you can enjoy all of the sights of the ride so definitely eat before rather than do the dinner.  The food was good but it made no sense to pay for it with the cruise when you'd miss half of the cruise.  Nice people on the ship.  There's a mini steam room that's pretty cool for kids."}
{"input": "The food was excellent and the staff was extremely courteous and friendly. I highly recommend this to all my family and friends!"}
{"input": "It's a college-town bar, what do you expect? Lol. Alcohol, pub/bar food, good tap selection, good atmosphere and specials. A Villanova tradition. It's not an upscale bar, or a great place to grab lunch. It is what it is, a bar!"}
{"input": "Best brunch place in Tennessee. Banana foster, Germantown Benedict and coffee are all amazing. The staff is super friendly and helpful.  Great place to spend a Saturday morning!"}
{"input": "I am an Italian southern girl who grew up on Italian creole food, thus, finding great Spanish food has been hard for me.  This restaurant has the best authentic Mexican/Spanish food in the greater New Orleans area.  The food is cooked fresh in an open kitchen that smells so good it will have your stomach growling.  The menu used to be written in Spanish however, they switched to pictures and an English menu which has only allowed me to explore Spanish cuisine further.  My husband and I are addicted to the horchata drinks.  He loves the fajitas, I love their enchiladas.  I chose a red sauce over my enchiladas instead of green which the hostess explained the green sauce was hotter but I found the red sauce to be spicy to perfection.   We placed our order to go because we love to eat at home, however they have a huge dining area and flat screen t.v. with soccer playing last time we went.  If your looking for real, authentic Mexican/Spanish cuisine then I recommend this restaurant."}
{"input": "Love this location! The staff is so friendly and helpful, one staff member even helped me search for a lost baby shoe my ten month old had kicked off his foot! A+++ customer service. Prices are reasonable. This is a huge location! Drop the kids off and set aside 2-3 hours to explore this Mecca of current style clothing, vintage gems, records galore, housewares, great toys,etc."}
{"input": "Was visiting for work and discovered this gem behind Publix.  The interior is clean, well decorated, has low, ambient traditional music in the background, cloth napkins (always a good sign), and excellent, attentive staff.  I was pleased with a large bowl of vegetarian soup one night while I was sick and returned the next day for the Pumpkin Curry special (with tofu/veg).  The waiter remembered me and asked how I was feeling; a pleasant surprise as a transient in town for the work week.  Tea was served in an individual-sized teapot.  The prices are affordable and well worth the return!  I would eat here regularly if I were a local...enjoy Port Richey!"}
{"input": "My family and I were visiting from CA and it was our first time at a Chick fil a. We ordered the spicy chicken, original chicken, chicken nuggets, strips, fries, and had a cookies and cream shake. Food was great, we loved the sauces. The only down point was the service. I asked the guy if there were free refills on the soda and he yes and the staff would be walking around. Every time I asked for a refill I'd get a \"surprised or annoyed\" look. It wasn't busy and I didn't understand why they just didn't put the fountain machines in the lobby like a normal restaurant?"}
{"input": "I really think Herbie's is more in the 3.5 stars range, and it could be bumped up to 4 after we try out their brunch (heard it's amazing!) or some of their cocktails that other reviewers raved about.\n\nNot sure if this place is ever crowded, but it certainly was fairly empty on a Wednesday night, so we were seated immediately.  I love sitting in the patio area with the view of Euclid.\n\nFood:\n1) Corn Chowder (special) - heard it was pretty good.\n2) Ligurian Shrimp Pasta - nice and fresh.  It def had a spicy kick to it, but not so much that someone like me who can't handle spiciness was able to enjoy a few bites.  Shrimp was cooked perfectly and were pretty large.\n3) Lobster Mac & Cheese (special) - pretty good.  Not swamped in cheese, though it lacked a little flavor (nothing some salt didn't fix).  Pretty big pieces of lobster."}
{"input": "New favorite spot in stl. Make a reservation and make it early. Place gets crowded. Best burger in stl in my opinion. Share some sides, you won't be mad."}
{"input": "This is a great place to hang on the patio with friends and tell a few tales over some ale. Start with the Carolina Sweets, move the cheese steak or burger, and end with the cookie!"}
{"input": "My hairdresser was very thorough in getting details of what I wanted. Then she checked frequently during the haircut to make sure I liked it.  I did!"}
{"input": "If you want The Best burger in Philly, this is the right place to come. The bread was fresh, meat was nothing but juicy, service was a amiable, price was descent and affordable to everybody!"}
{"input": "If you are not Italian and \"from the neighborhood\" expect to get \"less than\" everything - service, time at the table you reserved because a \"regular\" wants your table, and even smaller portions than the regulars! No kidding! The food is great so I definitely recommend it for that, but everything else around the food was, well, unpleasant (and I am being polite)! It's clear the owners don't care about generating new clientele from outside the neighborhood. Oh well, their loss. The owners should take note of the zillions of other restaurants within walking distance."}
{"input": "The Pros; beautiful view. Decent food\nThe Cons; waited over 30 minutes for a table while tables, yes plural as many as 6 at one point, sat empty. Multiple complaints to the hostess had no positive result. \nOne more pro: great waitress named Megan got us fed and kept our drinks full, eventually."}
{"input": "The salsa and guacamole is. Made fresh daily. The chips are home made as well. The shrimp burrito was huge but was tasty and fresh. The wait staff was just average."}
{"input": "My wife and I just moved to town and where saddened to have to move away from our local beloved Mexican restaurant.  We passed by this place several times knowing that once we moved in we would have to try it.  And OMG we where floored, the restaurant had great traditional ambiance and the service was top knotch.  They served glass bottle sodas which personally is something I love.  The food was amazing, my wife had the Taco Sombrero and I had the Chimichanga.  Both where amazing.  This place is 6 stars if I could give it."}
{"input": "Quick and super friendly. Emily was super helpful with our order. The burgers were cooked just right and our order of fries and onion rings were just the right amount of crisp. Overall, this was a great experience."}
{"input": "First let me say I've always gone here right when they open so I've never experienced the song time. That is a good thing, I think, because I would definitely need to be in just the right mood to enjoy that.  Having said that, I love the place!  I agree that it can take awhile, but Veronica is really quite entertaining and we always get a kick out of her.  The big thing, though, is the food.  I've tried a few German places around the country and this is without question the best.  We especially love the cheese spatzle, but honestly we've liked almost everything we've tried.  I wasn't a huge fan of the potato pancakes, but the soup with the pickles was fantastic, and oh wow was the crepe dessert a treat!  I've never managed to eat all that is served, and that works out fine because it makes for great leftovers.  I live in arizone but make a point of stopping here any time I am within an hour away.  Definitely very authentic and very good."}
{"input": "We made reservations, and were seated upstairs about a foot from the band at a table that seemed more like a bar table. After sitting for 45 min with NO SERVICE, just empty glasses and silverware, we left. While leaving the host kindly insisted to grab the manager after we told her what happened. (The hosts were wonderful!)   The manager did nothing besides essentially say that this wasn't typical and to come back."}
{"input": "Joe's is the place for great seafood! Service was fast and friendly! Clam chowder was great and of course the crab is always amazing! Eat at Joe's!! Love this place!"}
{"input": "One word: MEH\n\nHad dinner here Sunday Night...It's nice decoration and everything and the chef is funny but it's just for that money I've had more  delicious and entertaining hibachi. Good to go occasionally tho."}
{"input": "If you go to the Drafting Room just to try a new, interesting beer, you will never be disapppointed, even if you aren't impressed with the food.  But the food is interesting and good enough to stand on it's own."}
{"input": "I just had a relaxing shave and a nice cut from Billy. A nice authentic barber experience for the lads. The staff is friendly and welcoming. The space is comfortable and they offer coffee or tea to make you feel at home. Recommended."}
{"input": "So something with this truck must have changed, because I just went here for lunch and it was on point. I got the BBQ Meatball sandwich. The guy is definitely a joker and says what's on his mind, but nothing was insulting. Meatballs were hot and had soft texture. Sandwich roll is fantastic. Hoping people give this place a go because I'd go back for sure."}
{"input": "Really good bbq. The atmosphere was quite, service was quick. I recommend the coleslaw and kielbasa with sauerkraut."}
{"input": "Say you decide that you need a new door...and you only have $35.  Where do you go?  the Green Project. \n\nOr you have a bunch of left over building supplies, random bits of lumber, some roofing materials, maybe even some paint?  Where can you bring it so it doesn't end up in a landfill?  Again, the Green Project."}
{"input": "Best of the best!! Blue City is the best deli/sandwich shop in STL. Typically the small location is filled with live blues music and lots of great people. Don't be scared of the line, the food moves very quickly and you can enjoy a great unique soda or beer while you wait. If you haven't been to Blue City it's an STL staple, not eating here is like not seeing the arch!"}
{"input": "Happiness is:  warm cheese dip, fresh tacos made to order, and a bucket of beer.  I f'n love this place.  Don't compare it to authentic Mexican food, because that's not what it's trying to be.  Satco is Satco, and you are a commie if you don't like it.  There, I said it."}
{"input": "Loved the noodles, charred brussels sprouts, beer options, decor, and service. The overall character is superb. When you have non-Asians run an Asian-themed noodle bar, greatness happens. Can't wait to come back."}
{"input": "30th Street Station - how I prefer you over Penn Station in NYC! There is plenty of wide open space and seating that doesn't make me feel like I'm in an underground bunker. The lines for Amtrak trains tend to be orderly because you aren't forced to snake around the 400 other passengers milling about or sitting smack in the middle of the floor.\n\nThere are plenty of options for a meal or a snack before your journey. The new Old Nelson Market serves up a good breakfast sandwich in addition to having the odd sundries that you might need on your way home via SEPTA. I like that I can get fresh fruit there instead of from Au Bon Pain which charges an arm and a leg.\n\nSEPTA still bites most days but that's not the station's fault."}
{"input": "Good beer. Much better than most beer made in STL. Sweet. If you love sweet. \n\nAmbiance is sterile. No vibe. Looks like an office building. destination spot."}
{"input": "Wings Wings and more Wings!  Chatham Tap is my favorite place to get wings in the Indianapolis area.  They are meaty, the sauce is great, and I usually always have to take some home for the next day.  I went with a fairly large group and got to sample different things on the menu.  I highly recommend the onion rings!  They have a large selection of beer as well.  Since I heard they were a \"soccer bar\" I did not know what to expect when I first arrived.  However, the atmosphere is great.  It is full of fans of all different sports and the staff is willing to show whatever sport you want to watch on TV.  The service was excellent.  No one in my group had to ask for one thing while we were there.  I highly recommend this place to anyone who is up for a great meal, great service and a great time with friends."}
{"input": "Third Degree was commissioned to create an Eternal Light for our synagogue's new sanctuary in Deerfield, IL. This is one of the most sacred of fixtures in our new sanctuary. Together with our architect, Finegold + Alexander, a design and concept of both metal and glass was conceived. With guidance from Riggo Design, a metal artist in Chicago, Third Degree engaged Troco Custom Fabricators to jointly create the eternal light.\n\nNone of the parties involved in this project had ever designed an eternal light. We did our research, discussed various concepts and then worked with Doug Auer and Michael Moran for the implementation. We then held our breath as Third Degree and Troco did their work.\n\nThe result is magnificent: A breathtaking sculpture that has our congregation in awe!\n\nThe only thing better than the fixture itself was getting to know Doug and Mike and their genuine hearts - which illuminated everyone in the process."}
{"input": "We just left Mr T's and found them to be seriously overpriced.  For example, a white resin lounger was $40 higher than 3 other places we googled, and another lounger was $150 higher than advertised elsewhere.  For a slice that advertises as having 30% off their prices are still very high.  Seems like they just raised their prices to lower them 30%."}
{"input": "BBQ good lawd have mercy !"}
{"input": "I thought this place was really good! I love Thai food, and I've tried a good amount of places, this is definitely one of the fresher and better tasting ones I've had! The service is excellent, and the food is good too!"}
{"input": "The best of the best! Great outfitters with great employees. This business cares about its customers,even to the point of closing if conditions are unsafe on the river. That costs them revenue but they put safety first!"}
{"input": "Great, beautiful spot to do wine tasting. I loved all the wines I tried, great prices as well as service. I had a good"}
{"input": "Walk around inside and soak up the history. Talk to the guy selling shirts outside, he has some amazing stories to tell. They love jazz there and you can see it in their eyes. \n\nPeople who don't even like jazz walk away after spending some time there and talk about the fun and newfound appreciation for this American creation. \n\nWear loose clothing in the summer and try to ignore just how BAD everything around the area smells. It's worth it."}
{"input": "If you are going to charge $6 for truffle fries it would be great if they were close to warm and didn't look like the scrap fries at the bottom of the tray, we had to wait 10 minutes for our burgers to arrive you could put on a fresh batch of fries on during that time."}
{"input": "Nice building. Great location. Most of the staff are nice with the exception of the condescending and rude property manager."}
{"input": "Exceptional Greek food. Authentic and well done. Greatly situated in the sponge docks of Tarpon Springs and they handled my party of 15 well. Our server Nonda was very kind and most certainly very Greek! :) \n\nThe food was well done, especially the classic Greek salad, pork souvlaki, and gyro. The seafood was great too! The octopus was tender with a great char, and the snapper was very flavorful. My only regret was that I didn't have time for the bakery!"}
{"input": "Cool, cute, friendly, but genuine.  Great atmosphere and service.  Helpful staff and a perfect location on the edge of things.  \n\nAnd the food...  great.  My partner is an expatriate from NOLA, she and I are now living near San Francisco, and we came here *twice* for brunch over this past week.  (Granted, the second time was after the Ruby Slipper was too noisy ;).  I enjoyed the cornbread waffles, the Crabby Wife was complex and one of the most exciting brunch-y dishes I've had.  Yay for creativity and edge-pushing!"}
{"input": "Thank god there is finally a decent coffee shop in Brandon and I don't have to settle for Starbucks any longer! I got a cold brew and my boyfriend got a frozen latte and it was under $10 after tip! I am so happy right now!"}
{"input": "Fun, no-frills atmosphere, right on the water, where you can watch passersby and dolphins alike, while enjoying great food and accommodating service.\n\nMembers of our dining party ranged from a picky 7 year old, to two 40 somethings and a 72 year old grandmother. Captain Bill's had menu choices for everyone in our party, and they even made some ingredient substitutions for us. \n\nThe food arrived hot, fresh, and exactly to our specifications. Wait service and wait time were on point, and we all left the restaurant satisfied and having enjoyed the experience. We'll be back to Captain Bill's next time we visit John's pass. I hope you consider it too!"}
{"input": "Good pizza, and their plain cheese pizza is soo cheap! \n\nService is horrible though. Calzones are iffy....sometimes they are really good, other times just horrible!!! I guess it depends on who is working. Just not consistent in size either."}
{"input": "I did not want to post this on Yelp.  But after a surprisingly unconcerned and deflective conversation with the management of the Sandpiper Lodge here it is:\n\nI stayed in room 239 at the Sandpiper Lodge in Santa Barbara on 5-20 and 5-21- 2011.  Today, 5-27-2011, my physician has informed me that I am hosting SCABIES.   I am a married, 44 year-old, home-owner.  I did not do anything risky or unusual in the last month, or for many months (sigh).  I offer this information to all readers of yelp to draw their own conclusions.   Of course, I'm not using my real name here on the Internet, but there are hotel and medical records that will confirm all the relevant facts."}
{"input": "3.5 stars\n\nSome people have no clue how to eat Vietnamese food.  Lilly's is packed for lunch,  I've definitely never seen so many white people at a Vietnamese restaurant, and a good many of them seem clueless about Viet food but determined to eat it nonetheless.  That's a spirit worthy of admiration.  Now if they would actually try a bit of the sauce instead of eating plain dry vermicelli, or use the soup spoon when they eat pho, they would get a lot more out of the experience.  Perhaps the server should explain a bit or have a quick intro written into the menu. \n\nI was glad I got the vermicelli instead of the pho, which did not look appetizing.  The vermicelli was good.  But again, compared to other cities, the food is about average and a few dollars overpriced.  But you would be paying for the clean and modern atmosphere over the sticky floor and tacky setup of your average Viet place."}
{"input": "I like his branch. I have only been inside twice, but things moved quickly and efficiently and people were super friendly. The drive through usually doesn't have a line and the bankers are friendly, quick and helpful. Awesome branch!"}
{"input": "If anyone ever needs keys locks or anything of that sort for your car or house  Alpine Lock and Key Inc. is the bomb!! The owner Rick Carroll is one great person to deal with! I had a chipped key and key fob made for a third of the price of the dealer!"}
{"input": "Excellent oyster and catfish po' boys along with their red beans and rice. The catfish was moist and crispy as well as the oysters. The bread was fresh with the perfect amount of chew. Our server was attentive and pleasant throughout the meal. This is definitely a restaurant frequented by locals. Their prices are very reasonable and though their hours are limited the full menu is available during business hours. We were seeking to tick off a few more items on our to eat list and are so \"pleased\" we chose \"Please U\"!"}
{"input": "Ate lunch here today with my parents and we were beyond impressed! We ordered a Cuban sandwich, the turkey & avocado sandwich and the 51st Philly cheesesteak. We also got a side of tortilla chips and sides of guacamole and pico de gallo. The sandwiches were huge and absolutely delicious. The guac and pico were both very fresh and very tasty. The prices were great. The employees were very friendly. I will definitely be back to try other sandwiches and the tacos as well."}
{"input": "I stumbled on this for breakfast. I had a Backyard Bowl - yummy. The large is pretty big. The granola in it was fabulous crunchy but not overly sweet. It's great to find a restaurant that serves up organic foods. Tomorrow I'm going to try the Island bowl.  Pricing is about $6-7 but worth it --- better than eating pancakes."}
{"input": "Great haircut - needed a quick shape-up for seminar at Rutgers. They came through - highly recommended."}
{"input": "I echo the same sentiment that if you havent really had any type of gourmet donut, you will love these. I think the flavors are interesting and creative, but the actual dough is bland and made without sugar. If you get the donuts, get the Extra Fancy which are cream filled and usually tastier. I will say that their sandwiches and burgers are really good! Flavored just right, good ingredients."}
{"input": "OK...yeah yeah crab fries obviously! Thin crinkle cut extra crispy dusted in Old Bay and dunked in warm white cheese sauce- and must have red sauce mussels - the sauce is what I like, not a big fan of mussels but the sauce makes them so good I don't care they are weird little blackish green gloppy sea filters.    The buffalo chicken tenders are average .... I find the sauce too jarred tasting.  I love the atmosphere at the Packer Ave location - it's so big there is usually room to grab food/ watch a game.  It's Philly in your face so to all the other reviewers complaining about the noise....whaaah."}
{"input": "I'm certainly not a sports girl. At all.\n\nIn my 23 years of living across the bridge from the city, I've been to two Phillies games, both in the last year. I'm quickly realizing why people love to attend so much.\n\nCBP is in a great location, is fresh and newish, and has many perks, including the Hall of Fame Club, several Philly eateries, and semi-decent parking.\n\nNow, if only the Phillies would get their act together this year! (-- My attempt to sound like a sports fan."}
{"input": "While a bit out of the way as a lover of Mexican food I found this place to be quite good all the way to their dessert. The menu had items I rarely saw else where and the food was great taste wise as well. They even accommodated a special request for a meat selection not listed for an item. The tri leches dessert was one of the best I have had like that and they had a slightly different way of doing it. \n\nI would recommend this place!"}
{"input": "This is my favourite place to get fish tacos! It's all I ever order, along with the occasional queso or beans which are also delicious. My friend was visiting from out of town and he ordered the beef taco and chicken fajitas and thought they were pretty average. However, he agreed that the fish tacos were amazing. Since 2 full me up and they're only like $2.60 each it's a pretty happy visit all round for me! Plus the interior and patio are awesome\n(And there's Ben and Jerry's right next door for dessert)"}
{"input": "Best casino in Reno.   4 deck and 2 deck blackjack, real drink glasses (no plastic fratboy cups), amazing decorum that will burn your retinas, and the restaurants inside are better the big casinos on the strip by a factor of a thousand.\r\nThe rooms are stellar for the price.  Get a hot tub and chilllllll."}
{"input": "My new favorite place in Philly.  I will put this place up to any of the other cocktail bars in Philly and NY.  Service was outstanding.  the cocktails (especially the Fancy Free) are to die for.  The bar snacks (spicy nut mixture) was great too.  Great job guys.  Staff, decor, atmosphere...all spot on."}
{"input": "The barbers here will make you look TOO good. I'm not even joking. I got a haircut and shave yesterday and today I'm getting smiles and hellos from women walking past. I'm not used to this at all. I swear I've never looked this good in my life. In my opinion anyway. My barber was Katie. She really took care of me."}
{"input": "My husband and I went with another car, but I thought that Lou deserved a shout out for his customer service. He was personable, yet professional and never pushy. I've had issues with having service done on my car here a few years ago as well as others have complained about.. but if you are looking to get a new car, ask for Lou."}
{"input": "Boulevard Pizza is our go to place in the Sparks/Reno area. It looks like the decor has not changed since 1985, but who cares when they serve you a pizza this delicious! They have some fun arcade games for the kids."}
{"input": "This is seriously one of the best farmer's markets I've been to between (and including) San Francisco and San Diego. You can get almost anything here - from painted gourds to shrimps to organic lavender bunches to sweet cherries. Add in a backdrop of perfect weather and background music from a sitar player and a high school minstrel troupe and you'll start to get an idea of what's what here. All this and mas at totally reasonable prices too. I recommend trying out a cherimoya if you've never had one - it's a real treat!\n\nFor more info on the weekly schedule, check out the website - the one on Saturday is on the corner of Santa Barbara and Cota Streets and it goes from 8:30 to 12:30. Even though it's pretty bustling, parking wasn't a problem."}
{"input": "I am from Colorado and am visiting Santa Barbara and let me tell you... what a great place to eat. The food was quality, but the customer service was even better. Also, I thought the price was really good for the amount of food you get. Food came out fast as well. Overall, I'd say it's a great breakfast place if you are in Santa Barbara"}
{"input": "Meagan is amazing! She fit me in last minute and gave me one of the best deep tissue massages I've ever had. I went in with lower back pain and discomfort and left feeling amazing. She makes it seem easy. She found every sore spot on me and just fixed it all within an hour appointment. She obviously knows her anatomy well. She also has a welcoming and genuine personality. Do yourself a favor and book with her. You won't be sorry."}
{"input": "I've been to New Day Meadery quite a few times, and every time I come I'm never disappointed! Normally when I come here I order the South Cider or the Shelby Blue Ribbon, but on my last trip I decided to taste one of their seasonal items. I tasted the Paulding Light which has cranberry, honey, and a touch of lime. It was pretty good, but was not as sweet as Shelby Blue Ribbon in my opinion. But that is what I like about New Day, they always have a variety of meads and ciders that everyone can enjoy, not just sugar fans like myself. All in all it is one of my favorite places in Fountain Square! Their service is always prompt and their staff always friendly."}
{"input": "This place just could not be better. I love how they have a fully stocked new release section. You never have to worry if whether they have a new release or not. Great! I even have to admit that I don't mind when I have to pay late fees, because I love supporting this place."}
{"input": "I went to Landmark Americana to support a charitable event the restaurant was doing for my son's school, Woodlynde. I had avoided the restaurant because of lukewarm experiences at restaurants that had previously occupied this space. But they have a new customer now due to the friendly service and good food.\n\nThey did a good job keeping the menu short and sweet which seems to allow them to focus on what they do best. I had crab bisque and a Thai salad with chicken. Both were fresh and delicious. Our server kept our drinks full. I plan to visit again with the rest of my family."}
{"input": "I went to so many Chinese restaurants , but never likes the food. But here, for the first time I truly enjoyed myself at this place. Best Chinese food ever. I loved it :). I will always recommend Han Dynasty.  Very slow service but tasty when finally arrived!"}
{"input": "Went here for a weekday lunch, did two ala cartes and two all you can eats. All the rolls were fresh and  tasted marvelous. Recommend!"}
{"input": "I chose to try this salon out because it was close to home and I needed my solar nails removed and I wanted gel instead. They clearly didn't know how to remove solar as they spent an hour scraping it off after the initial  soak. They proceed to do gel, but she coated my skin more than the nail and after several redos finally finished. A few days later, the gel is coming up. Never will return."}
{"input": "Great local bar. Exremely good bartenders, they never let a drink get close to being empty. Pretty good burger and wings. Great prices, miss the 50-75-100 special though..."}
{"input": "Today I dined at the Spice Kitchen for the buffet. I got there at 11:30 am, and although the food is still good, I am sad to say the level of service has plummeted.  I was seated and the host/waiter forgot to ask me what type of naan I wanted.  He asked, I told, and 15 minutes later the naan finally arrived. I also ordered an iced tea. He NEVER offered a refill. Also, he only refilled my water once, and those of you who eat spicy food know that \"Once is not enough\". \n\nThe host/ waiter seemed to spend most of his time talking on the headset phone. (and I doubt it was all business)\n\nI am VERY disappointed, and if they don't shape up by my next visit, I will be taking my patronage elsewhere."}
{"input": "What a great shop!\n\nI have been there several times and I only have good things to say about it.\n\nThe store is family owned and all of the family members that work there are very friendly and knowledgeable about their product. Ask them anything!\n\nThe selection of spices is huge! I have browsed there for over and hour, looking at all of their items. Just to give you an idea, they have dozens of different salts and peppers alone! Lots of fun and unique items as well, like spicy Mayan chocolate (great for brownies with a kick), and rose water.\n\nI love the freeze-dried corn that they sell, try it!"}
{"input": "Have been about 6 times and felt a decline in the service and food each time. The beer will always be quirky and tasty but the food...not worth it for the price. Server seemed to be on their first day and didn't know much about the beer - never the case if you sit at the bar so head there if just looking for some innovative beers."}
{"input": "The eggroll was amazing. \n\nThe sesame chicken was average. I asked for spicy and it wasn't hot at all. \n\nThe fried wontons were kinda weird. \n\nOther than that, the delivery was quick and got the orser correct. \n\nI think I would order again but ask for extra spiciness and see if it comes hot."}
{"input": "This place has been around for years and it is consistently wonderful. Fresh food, healthy ingredients, home-made tasty dressings, reasonable prices, fast service. The owner is always there at the counter, and you can see he has a loyal, well-treated, and helpful staff with low turnover. I only wish there was a Back to the Garden Uptown!"}
{"input": "Don't order take out! The portions are Smaller but the price is same. Hibachi wasn't worth 25 dollars. If your gonna get this place eat in. The meat and sushi is good. Just wish they portion it right."}
{"input": "Great place, very modern. I like the choices of food items and beverages, it was well thought. Great sitting spaces, the concept is absolutely fantastic, with the clients in mind. You can pick from a very intimate, romantic corner to a more casual stool sitting by the bar area. Not sure about the charm of their live singers, they can be truly annoying if they are singing for a long time, which is usually the case. Heavy metal by the end of the day? That is a \"no-no\", please! Other than that, this is quite an interesting place to meet and relax."}
{"input": "Decent food, decent amounts. Just order a few different plates and share with the others at the table."}
{"input": "What what???\n\nI've seen these all over the country and haven't been back since about 6 years ago so I couldn't recall what the place was all about.\n\nWent last night with a friend and discovered why us americans are the size we are.\n\nEverything is HUGE, and I mean HUGE! However everything is also \"good 'ol American home cookin\" which translates to \" Oh hell yes I'll have another scoop\" \n\nI had the Goldpan chicken (I think that's right) which consisted of chicken in a sour cream based sauce with red onions and mixed with sauteed veggies, mashed potatoes and a large, buttermilk biscuit.\n\nI only dare to come here once every couple years, otherwise I will DIE of chronic heart failure from too much goodness."}
{"input": "I drive down the 101 from the Bay Area to LA frequently. Whenever I can, I stop here for a meal.  Their charashi bowl is fantastic and for the lunch special, it's a great price!  Love the people here and this something I always look forward to on my drive!"}
{"input": "Best Mexican restaurant I've been to in a long time food was great drinks were great and prices are reasonable"}
{"input": "Our first visit to El Sol was to celebrate my daughter's birthday.  Needless to say, we were all BLOWN AWAY!   Our waiter was so attentive and polite, the pina colodas, margaritas and food was to die for, and at the end of the meal the whole staff came out with a very large cake, a desert for my daughter, sombreros and FIREWORKS!!  Birthday songs were played on the televisions and it was very festive.  \nI'm so happy this gem is close enough to make regular dinner visits.  I'm also happy that an order of fajitas will feed me for dinner an lunch the next day. \nGood job, guys!"}
{"input": "Love this place! The turkey, beans, and biscuits are amazing. Have had better pecan pie but that won't stop me from coming back :)"}
{"input": "I love this place.  The food is great and the space and staff are very pleasant.  Highly recommended for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike."}
{"input": "The new location at 667 Central Avenue Rocks the Coffee Kasba...  So friendly, comfortable seating and grounds for many return visits."}
{"input": "This place was packed at lunch time, I'm talking one or two spots in the dining room and a drive thru line wrapped around the building. Despite this, they kept the line moving, the tables clean, and all the employees were very pleasant.\n\nI always expect quality product from them, I don't know that I've ever had truly bad food from Chick fil a, but I was impressed by the way this one ran so efficiently while still delivering good product. This is how far food should look."}
{"input": "Excellent store with great selection and very knowledgeable sales people.  Whether it's Pyramid Lake fishing or Las Vegas Sheep hunting they will know exactly what to use and have it in stock."}
{"input": "Excellent service and food was delicious from the spring rolls, wonton soup, shrimp fried rice to the spicy noodle with shrimp. Atmosphere is pleasant quiet music, indoor or outdoor seating and someone  always coming around to check on your table without being a pest! The prices are beyond reasonable for portion, flavor and location."}
{"input": "Super clean and very friendly.  Well priced for range time.  We went on a Friday, which happens to be $15 Friday date night.  It was technically 2:00 in the afternoon, but the pricing was still good.\n\nThe range safety officer is a nice guy, keeps an eye on everything and gives pointers if you ask.  Knows A LOT about correct pistol grip and eye domination.  \n\nThe gun prices seemed in line with what I would expect from a gun store and they have a lot of rental options. Nothing full auto though."}
{"input": "When in the middle of nowhere with just a few hours before a flight home, I bought too much stuff for my New Years trip to St. Louis and figured I'd check to see if I could get a used suitcase for a good price.  I found a Samsonite suitcase for $6.   SIX DOLLARS.  I know if I went to Ross or TJ Maxx it would have been $130 easy.   So thanks again Goodwill.  You always seem to do me right in the heat of the moment which is why I always donate to you guys before anyone else with my old unused clothing items.  Happy New Year."}
{"input": "My first experience did mot go well due to the heavy accents of the employees. I called ahead so my order would be ready for me to pick up and it was, it just was not what I ordered. They are nice people and corrected my order but instead of simply picking up my food I had to wait 20 minutes To get my original order. When all was said and done, the food was good.\n\nI was nearby and decided to give them a second chance. This time I ordered a pizza steak and I was really impressed! I need to have a couple more before I can declare them my new favorite pizza steak. Plenty of mozzarella cheese and the roll is stuffed with meat and just enough sauce. It's looking like this place is a lot better than my first impression."}
{"input": "After trying the pizza here on Halloween night when we arrived I did not think I would give it a second try. Pizza that night was bad. Card board crust and No flavor. Short staffed and our poor waitress was completely overwhelmed. \n\nOn my last night being tired and not wanting to go all over NOLA trying to find the perfect meal we decided to give it another try. So I went with the simple cheddar burger and sweet potato fries. My boss went with the oyster po boy. Let just say this was one of the best meals I had all week. My boss raved about her oyster po boy (huge portion).  My burger was juicy and very nicely seasoned. Sweet potato fries were excellent. The sushi looked fresh and beautifully made. Would have tried but could not eat another bite. Just goes to show that most places can have an off night. Glad I gave this place a second chance."}
{"input": "The food here is greatbut kinda expensive. The curry noodle is kinda salty, but I recommend the vege fried rice, it is really good. The place is kinda small so if you decide to go better call for reservation."}
{"input": "This a great little coffee shop that has great coffee and espresso. Great place to grab a coffee and get some work done if necessary. I will definitely be stopping by again to get some iced coffee or cappuccino when I'm in town."}
{"input": "We had a very nice brunch here. The food was consistently quite good and the service was pretty efficient and courteous. The omelets were sumptuous, the beverages fun (including a bloody mary bar.. we did have to ask for fresh bacon as it had run out). \n\nI did the budget breakfast which hit the spot with scrambled eggs, roaster taters, and a sweet muffin. The fish tacos were also good. Nice al fresco dining on the patio."}
{"input": "Not really any seating. No air conditioning inside but the bagels are fresh and kettle-cooked. Kind of a hole in the wall. I'm sure we would never want to know just how dirty the kitchen is. But the bagel tasted like sweet, sweet love."}
{"input": "We were looking for a dairy free ice cream place to take the kids. BAM! GELATO!!!! When we walked in, my kids both instantly got super excited. The display of Gelato is beautiful. Very fancy. Lots of colors. The menu also included lots of paninis and other little snacks and soups. It would be a great place for lunch if you're looking for something quick, but not fast food and greasy. We had the vanilla and the strawberry kids size gelato for our first trip. We will definitely be going back again. It is a great stop for family walk time too. We definitely recommend."}
{"input": "How this place gets so many stars I just don't know.  Devil's food cake with cheap icing and chocolate shavings does not make a great cake.  If you are in a pinch for a good cake go to the Whole Foods at 20th & Callowhill and they can generally letter up a birthday cake for you with a quickness."}
{"input": "This place is awesome. Awesomely expensive, but a good splurge for\nSure"}
{"input": "Well, good food, reasonable price. But as they themselves advertised, the service is indeed slow. I waited 20 mins to get my water, and another 10 mins to place the order, and yet another 20 mins to get the food. I went there twice. Both time, I experience good food + slow services. \n\nWill I come again? Well, maybe. I will make sure I sit inside or near the door at porch so that servers could see me."}
{"input": "Nice relaxing place to get a massage! Same day appointments are easy to come by! I have never been disappointed with any therapist I have had at the Center!"}
{"input": "My friend ordered delivery and we got an excellent meal (shrimp fried rice,  two chicken dishes). Can't say enough about the taste.  The owner called my friend and gave us a complimentary dessert, and invited us to dine in in the future. \n\nGreat food,  great service."}
{"input": "I found my stylist, Emily, through instagram and i'm so glad that I did. I met with her for a consultation then scheduled an appointment for a cut and balayage a month later. I showed her a ton of pictures and she let me know which color would work best with my complexion and natural hair color. The cut and color turned out great. I had mentioned during the consultation that I wanted to learn how to curl my hair. She remembered me saying that and offered to teach me how to at the end of my appointment. It was a great first experience and i'm looking forward to going back!"}
{"input": "Awesome! The food, the service, the ambiance. Just wow! Had the BEST queso empanadas, fantastic yuca fries, amazing sangria--all served by a friendly and knowledgeable waitress (Lauren). Just loved it! We'll be back!"}
{"input": "Went on a Monday night early and we were seated right away.  Waiter was friendly and efficient.  The food was delicious and plentiful.  We would definitely go back again!"}
{"input": "Had a really great experience here after leaving another Thai restaurant due to a long wait time. The Tom Yum is some of the best ever... not too brothy and full of veggies as was the cashew veggie entree and the rice was great too. Great service and gracious lady behind the counter. Will return asap!"}
{"input": "Pleasantly surprised.  This is the no-frills, greasy takeout joint that's sorely missing from the Main Line.  I had the Orange Beef and found the beef tender.  There was ample sauce, rice and broccoli.  It was considerably better (and cheaper) than the same entree at Chinese Delight in Wayne."}
{"input": "Underwhelming, to say the least.  Came back here after years away only because they keep their kitchen open late.  Wish we had opted for a casino because the food here is completely uninspiring.  I had a tasteless steak sandwich on a too-big roll with an afterthought of a side salad. The place is nicely appointed and they have big menu which might be why nothing tastes great.  Moxies has been around forever and I expected so much more. I think if you are into playing some bar top machines this place is fine but would never suggest eating here just for the food."}
{"input": "I always enjoy my treatments and the time I spend at Ame.  I have had both prenatal and regular massage, nail treatments, waxing and facials.  By far, my favorite treatment is the Ame Touch Facial because the products are wonderful, the atmosphere is so relaxing and they massage your hands and feet too!  I can't wait to go back."}
{"input": "I like the ambiance a lot, and for the most part the food is really good. HUGE fan of the whipped feta- most important thing to order!!"}
{"input": "Probably the best KOA that we've come across on the west. Shocked at how well this place is ran, kept up, all the things! \nThe price reflects it! \nThe spots are amazing and kept up very well, super clean. \nPools are very nice, and made for entertaining. \nThe front is amazing. Staff is friendly and accommodating. \nOnly amazing things to say about this place. I can't imagine how hot it is in the summer, but I'm sure this Koa does well!"}
{"input": "We just ate here for the first time last week.  It was a little confusing at first about how everything works but you quickly figure it out. We ordered the cobb salad. It tasted fresh and looked great. The order came out quickly and they were slammed at lunch.  They also have a ChargeItSpot where you can charge your cell phone for free while you eat, which I needed. A couple of negatives, the acoustics are bad in here. It was hard to hear them call your order and hear each other talk. It was a nice day so we sat outside. They need to label the plasticware holders. You can't tell if you're grabbing a knife, fork or spoon. Also the need an outside trash can. We had to go back inside during the crowed rush to throw our trash out.  Minor improvements that would make it that much better. Overall, it was great and will definitely go back."}
{"input": "Awesome spot and off the beaten touristy path in Nashville. Will be my first stop when I come back to visit"}
{"input": "I really wanted to give these people the benefit of the doubt. The grooming cut has always been so cute (only reason for 2 stars), but I just can't deal with their stupidity. I've been taking my dogs, Cleo and Chloe, for over a year and every single time I go it's PAINFUL checking them in. They spell Chloe, Chole. I've reminded them for the last year to please change it because every time I set up an appointment it confuses them. They had my phone number is backwards also. I've asked them EVERY visit to correct this, not just at the grant and swan location either. I went in today for Chloe's 4 week cut and now she's not even in their system. It's like a bunch of brainless high school drop outs are running the place. Won't return for my own sanity."}
{"input": "Had a blast at the raw bar savoring their terrific bivalves and the local beers. Rodney the shucker is outgoing, informative and an amateur philosopher. Mufaletta was just okay, cold in the middle. Boiled shrimp were just right. Loved their broiled Oysters Desire dish. \n\nBreakfast next day: wonderful waitress Ruthie took great care of us and picked up on our impaired state from the previous night's revels. Coffee and Bloody Mary's came quickly. She even made up a little fruit bowl for us to take back to one of the slackers in our party. At her urging I went for the breakfast Jambalaya Skillet. Disappointing. Covered in a gloppy sauce, bland and only minimal sausage. Needs to come off the menu."}
{"input": "We would frequent the 37th and Market Street location in Philadelphia.  We  their food!  During our last visit, I felt compelled to report to a Manager some less than hygienic habits of the chef (visible to the patrons).  Upon scheduling to visit not long after, I noticed they earned an F rating.  We were all so disappointed because we loved this place but refuse to eat in any Philadelphia eatery that rates less than a B\n\nI pray they cleaned up their act because that pickled flounder soup is calling my name!"}
{"input": "As someone from out of town, all I could look forward to was the food. And let me tell you it was a disappointment. I read many good reviews about this establishment. If I could give them no stars I would. Could not run out of there fast enough. Their half peeled shrimp was literal mush. They had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. The shrimp peel was brown, they were probably cooked about a month ago, put in a freezer and served them to me as they thawed. Their jambalaya was further than the truth. It was pasta in tomato sauce with a minuscule piece of chicken. And the fact that I had to pay as I left was bewildering. Not even their mediocre waiters could save, what I would call, the worst dining experience of my life. The only thing that made it worthwhile was when the hostess removed the atrocity that was my dinner and asked \"they nasty?\""}
{"input": "no stiff drinks here... electronic jigs, but hey it was my first drink in NoLa and the only bar in my terminal."}
{"input": "Delicious! I had the kale salad and chocolate spinach smoothie. The portions are very generous."}
{"input": "Definitely great experience overall. \nNice clean room, comfortable bed, great view, on point service."}
{"input": "I am happy to give this a nice rebound of an update. I stayed her in mid April over Spring Break.\n\nI will keep it short, sweet and right to the point. The room was almost perfect, they forgot the trio of shampoo, conditioner and lotion. Everything from the front end, to housekeeping, to the breakfast was greatly improved. The manager was involved not only at the front desk on check-in, but also at breakfast clearing tables. The common areas were clean.\n\nI am very happy that I elected to give them a try again because the location is really terrific if your doing Busch Gardens."}
{"input": "Tried this placed based on YELP reviews.  Beef brisket / tendon noodle soup was as most reviewers report - delicious.  Pancake wrapped pork was a new dish to us, and very good as well.  We also had mango and blueberry fruit slushes - refreshing and tasty, and probably not easily found in Reno.  The disappointment, however, for me was the pork chow fun.  The noodles were oily, yellow (like they were egg and not rice) and a bit chewy versus the usual wider, white \"ho fan\" ribbon noodles.  Dry fried Chow Fun typically has brown char marks from wok frying which provide the flavor, and these noodles didn't seem like they were fried.  A better nearby choice for Chow Fun, IMHO, would be Pho Mein in the El Dorado."}
{"input": "Take plenty of Sun Screen !!!  Really well organized and run. Not a bad seat no matter where you get a ticket. I recommend a top row of the reserve grandstand. It is nice because you can bring something to hang on the fense to shade your back after mid day. Plenty of food and drink available but you can bring your own drinks just no ice-chest/coolers. I took a shoulder bag cooler, an insulated lunch box that held 8 drinks and that was ok.  Expect to have your bag searched for guns and pepper spray, no problem with a pocket knife. First races are at 0800 gate opens at 0700. Last race at 1630. There is a free concert after the last race of yo chose to stay longer. We will be back next year for sure."}
{"input": "I'm still new to Tucson, but having tried a large sample of the various pizza places near the U of A, I have to say that this is the best so far. \n\nIn fact I'd say it's the best I've ever had. Better than the places I tried in NYC even. The crust is just magical. The five alarm (which I tried) is the perfect amount of spicy for those of us who crave that extra spicyness in our food. \n\nIf you decide to try it, I doubt you'll be disappointed."}
{"input": "Don't have much negative to say. Family ate here before our first lightning game and everyone enjoyed the meal. We are partial to Mexican cuisine and it didn't disappoint although offering complimentary chips and salsa like every other Mexican restaurant in the US would have been nice."}
{"input": "Yea, I mean it's good but nothing to keep going back for in my opinion. If you don't eat heavy food on a daily basis this spot isn't going to make you keep going back. It's more of a treat spot. \n\nMy husband ordered the banana fosters French toast which he loved! And I ordered the crab omelette with a biscuit. My omelette needed a tad more salt but the biscuit was phenomenal. Everything was just so heavy. I tried originally ordering the jumbo crab meat salad but I was told that they didn't have any jumbo crab. So I was stuck ordering an omelette. I'm sure if you come here for lunch the options are a bit less heavier. They do also offer a variety of fresh juices but that's not what I want to order at 8 am in the morning. I want food but the kind of food that doesn't weigh me down for the rest of the day!\n\nEither way, the staff is very friendly and welcoming. And this restaurant has a very fun vibe to it!"}
{"input": "Hard to mess up eggs...food was good. Service was very friendly. Reasonably priced.\n\nCould be a little cleaner. It took the term hole in the wall a little too literally."}
{"input": "Omgoodness!!! This place is a gem!!! Delish! We had the duck tacos, jalapeño hush puppies, collard greens (done right) and the smoked chicken wings!!! Everything was amazing!! The duck tacos were simple with fresh mixed greens, the smoked chicken wings really were succulent with the best tangy sweet sauce ever, and they were served with a real house made ranch dressing, The collar greens, don't even get me started they were delicious cooked with a reduced Maple syrup and bacon yumminess! The hush puppies were house made as well served with a honey butter that was to die for.   We sat at the bar, because the place was jamming! Wonderful food and great service!"}
{"input": "THIS place right here is a good reason to move to Tucson with your classic car. I flew in for a quick visit to check out a '65 Mustang yesterday and these guys were so incredibly accommodating, I was blown away. \n\nThey bent over backwards to obtain all the information they could about my potential purchase and even got a Mustang appraiser on the phone to consult with me on a purchase price. They were thorough and took their time as opposed to rushing me through and just phoning it in, and it cost a whopping $98. \n\nI highly recommend these guys. They are experts and know classic cars, and from the inventory - new cars as well, like the back of their hands.\n\nThanks Guys!"}
{"input": "Worst restaurant experience ever. First, this place is super cramped! The noise level was atrocious. I don't know why they haven't done anything about this. We could not engage in an enjoyable conversation. \nSecond, my plate had dried up food on it from the previous guest. I understand that can happen. But nevertheless, yuck! The service was mediocre. Third, the food was loaded with salt. My husband has high blood pressure so this was a major concern to me. I took a few bites but didn't finish and definitely didn't bother to take home. You cannot enjoy the flavor of the food because everything was drowning in salt. Gross. Fourth, our bill was extremely high. This food was definitely over priced for the quality.  The dessert was decent. But the thing that put the final nail in their restaurant coffin, was the Roach that grazed over my high heel on my way out. I wanted to die. Never again!!!!! Don't waste your time or your money and they seriously need to hire an exterminator now!!!!!!"}
{"input": "We went there and got bottle service. Their service was very good!  The security and bottle service ladies came and checked on us constantly making sure if we needed anything. We had our own private bathroom which the security walked us to. The music could've been better. Maybe like some updated hip hop. :)"}
{"input": "Everything about this place makes me SOOO happy. From the staff to the food to the patio - there are a few reasons why I have been here almost as many days I've been in Nashville. Keep it up y'all!"}
{"input": "Let me start off by saying the BBQ shrimp at Mr. B's was the single best plate of food I had while in New Orleans. Spent almost five days there, and didn't enjoy any dish more. \n\nStaff was really friendly and we enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant. Felt like we were in a throwback New York joint. \n\nThe only reason I'm not giving them 5-stars is because the crab cake, although mostly crab, was not very flavorful and overpriced for just being a single serving. \n\nSo, if you want BBQ shrimp, I'd recommend this place 11 times out of 10."}
{"input": "Holy cow this place is good.  I was in the area and hungry, so of course I turned to Yelp.  I read that other reviewers loved the shrimp tacos - oh my God, they are amazing!  I also tried the taco al pastor and it was great.  Next time, I'll try a burrito, but I'm definitely coming back for more shrimp tacos!"}
{"input": "picked them randomly from the Internet as I needed my wrought iron doors re modified in a rush job. They responded quickly and did the job in three days. Very professional workers came and did measurements and took the doors with them. Called me that the repairs were done two days later. They came and installed the doors and I was happy with their work!\n\nPlease don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"input": "Our very foodie friend Marc recommended \nMr B's as one of his top 3 in NOLA. We had a truly delicious dinner at KPaul's the night before, and we had high expectations. We walked in with a conference group of 6. Restaurant was fancy and crowded but they were able to seat us right away! Everyone enjoyed. The gumbo appetizers, 3 soup sampler, artichokes, and fried oysters were amazing. Best fried oysters ever. Huge pork chop. Red snapper delicious but portion a little small. Nearby tables had their famous shrimp--looked messy and tasty. We tried 3 of their desserts--all good, especially pecan pie. Three amazing servers for our table--very attentive. Definitely worth it."}
{"input": "Tonic, tonic tonic. I will admit I used to go here a lot in my college days. I was at UCSB when this place first opened. It was a great alternative if you wanted a nice club/bar to go to...sometimes Madison's and Sharkees just got old.  The drinks are a little pricier but worth it for the ambiance.  When I went there it was a hot spot for all the sorority girls - not sure if that is still the case but anyway...\n\ncheck it out if you are out and about during Thursday night college downtown."}
{"input": "Literally one of the worst places I've been in years. 10 minutes to get a drink, food swimming in grease and horribly seasoned. Best thing we had was side salad and beer. Complete waste of $40."}
{"input": "Stopped in for the lunch menu with my girlfriend, place was extremely clean, food was ON POINT!  And AFFORDABLE Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"input": "This place was awful. I went because it was the only place open late at night. Burger and fries were horrible and I got an apple pie which tasted like it came out of a refrigerated box."}
{"input": "Yelp wants you to give stars but this place isn't worth it crap..00000 stars for this pizza hut..I ordered online for delivery. Easy right nope. They messed up the whole order and forgot the wings. Then I called the Manger she barely listen offered no help at all. Just send me out my correct order and take this back. Nope never happened, she sent the driver back out  to get the wrong order still no wing and then refused to refund.. she never brought the right order, don't use your hard earned money here...they really need someone that cares about a job..I'll never order from this place again because if you complain she probably spits in your food..don't waste your time and money..go to the pizza hut on Judge Perez, they are the best..and to the manager, karma a bitch, just wait..and fuck you bitch..have a nice day"}
{"input": "went here for the first time today - drawn by the amazing smell of the charcoal grill.  looked around for a menu - couldnt find one..then a regular in the line said - \"theres only one thing on the menu any given day\"...line was slow...had to wait almost 15 minutes with just 5 people in front..\n\nThe food was incredible...the hummus was fantastic...the falafel fantastic...the greens were easily separated (and tossed..)..the chicken was tender and amazingly tasty...and the rice-lentil mix (no idea what it really is) was terrific...there was also a giant piece of bread...whole bunch of food for $10...\n\ndefinitely worth the wait...definitely worth going back again"}
{"input": "I found this park through reviews on facebook - where they report glowingly that it looks \"like something out of Hobbiton in Lord of the Rings, or Alice in Wonderland.\" I agree- it looks beautifullly maintained with small baby waterfalls as the creek meanders its way down the Valley. \n\nThe walking path is paved and flat, so it is not challenging / is safe for seniors. I would guess the entire oval-shaped loop would be around 3/4 of a mile - it was a lovely slow 20 minute walk. \n\nIt appeared sparsely populated but I passed two families with strollers and a group of seniors. Big parking lot, off Campbell Road on the North side of the park. A hidden gem, but if you are around and up for a quiet walk through a beautiful garden, come by! Its free!"}
{"input": "Worth the wait, the fish and grits were my favorite but the Gemantown West Benny was pretty good too! We want to go back for the bananas foster pancakes, they looked delicious!"}
{"input": "I took one look at the large greasy slice in front of my eyes and knew I had made an adequate decision. While I was forced to poney up a solid 8 dollars for two slices which is rather insane, the pizza was good, and it's state street so come on.\n\nAs a New York native I live by the credo that only pizza which can be folded in half can actually be considered pizza. While the cheese to sauce ratio was slightly in favour of the queso the crust was solid enough to uphold the amount of grease, which personally I found refreshing. \n\nIn a world of pizzeria chains which are stretching the definition of pizza it was nice to grab a delicious old school style slice even if the price was ridiculous. Would eat again"}
{"input": "I like Deweys's primary because it's close to my house.  The pizza looks great and the crust is good.  My gripe with Dewey's is that the pizzas are just so salty.  We had the pepperoni, socrates revenge, and bronx bomber.  It's like a eatting a brick of salt.  I'm not sure if it's the amount of salt sauce combined with the salty meat, but the combo so overwhelming, I tastebuds are numb to any other flavor.  Otherwise, if they fix that, I would love it.  \n\nAs for the salads, they're a good size, but seems like something you can toss together yourself.  I usually not get because don't want to spend the money on it."}
{"input": "Talk about turning lemons into lemonade. Prestigious Auto Body hit it out of the park with customer service. I came in after a fender bender because they were approved by insurance. Needless to say dealing with insurance is always terrible but Jaime was my advocate. He made sure everything was done was for my convenience and to make everything as seamless as possible. I've always be intimidated by body shops because I'm a novice with these type of things but I I've never experienced such amazing customer service period! Jaime even gave me wedding advice! I will recommend Jaime and the team to anyone in need of their services."}
{"input": "ya wanna get crunked? No problem, buy a 16oz of the finest malts for $1.19...that's about 7.5cents an ounce, best bang for yo bill! Good location, lot's of homies..brown bag to stardom"}
{"input": "I really wanted to like this place. I went in knowing about the unique setup, but didn't account for two things: 1- how crowded it was - this concept only works if you have a sense that you're discovering something unique, not when you're colliding with sorority girls and food runners all night. 2- this is definitely not a place to eat dinner, particularly given #1. The food took forever, and when I went to find my own plates (we were sharing dishes) I was told that all the plates were dirty.  On sum I think Bacchanal is an interesting concept, but they've outgrown it. Time to reinvent."}
{"input": "This is a unique dining experience. The epitome of fusion! We had a virgin milkshake that was outstanding. The burger was also good. The sushi rolls were unique, but good. The service was very good. A fun place to try in Nashville."}
{"input": "I really think when I walked into this store a choir of foody angels hovered above me and sang HALLELUJAH...This place is a mecca of gourmet foods and unique ingridients that home or seasoned chefs would use. You could literally build a basket for an episode of chopped in this store with minimal effort.\n\nI came on a saturday and it was like walking through costco or sams club except instead of frozen crap it was gourmet goodness showcased for your tasting pleasure. Cured meats, nectars, baked goods, cheesecakes, chips, wine tastings, deli items, seafood dips, and all the stuff you can't find anywhere else in tucson lines the aisles of this store. \n\nI have never been so awestruck by a grocer it was heavenly and I will gladly drive back again next time my culinary needs exceed the chops of safeway or fry's."}
{"input": "Sorry they've closed the restaurant as of 2/18/18. I always loved their dumplings, Peking duck, and other specialties."}
{"input": "I was told this place is a must for a Sonoran hot dog. I was visiting from out of town and had never had one. It was good, but the whole Sonoran hot dog isn't really my thing (too many components for me) so I can't say it was great. The guacamole on the other hand, was great! I also had the taco combo - the chicken and carne asada were very good but the cabeza was slimy. BK has a salsa bar that allows you to help yourself to your own toppings and I appreciated that. Service was good, food arrived quickly. It was pretty packed during lunch on a weekday."}
{"input": "I absolutely love this place it's such a small quant place that you would walk by nine times out of ten. Ive had Taiwanese food at other places but none have been as good. It's just something I can't describe. When ever I go I have to get a order of wonton soup and the house special lo Mein. A must try."}
{"input": "If you want to feel like you are in one of those classic movies, you know, all of the ones Ted Turner screwed up by colorizing them, stop here. This station is a time machine with modern amenities. Architecture, efficiency, décor, ambiance .. it's all packaged up in one wonderful location."}
{"input": "Sorry, I have to say this is the poorest excuse of a restaurant ever.  What is up with the girls wearing stockings under those shorts.  That's nasty.  And do you guys really like when they sit next to you and act like they want to talk.  Oh yeah, I forgot it's every girls dream to sit at a table of fat, chicken wing grease covered, over 40, balding, married guys who may or may not have a pot to piss in.  But you're the same dude that goes to a strip club and thinks the stripper really likes you (dumb ass!!).  This is a joke of a theme restaurant and I am embarrassed to be a human when I see them do that hula hoop act in the middle of the bar.  I've been to Hooters twice and I don't plan on ever going again.  I guess it's okay if you just want some beer and wings but aren't there plenty of local bars that do that part better and with more dignity?  Even strip bars have more dignity.  But like Grandma used to say, \"...there's an ass for every seat\".  Grandma was always right."}
{"input": "I can't say enough good things about Fox Fitness.  Becky makes working out challenging but fun and you will see results.  The atmosphere is fun, always a little different to keep you engaged for the best full body workout results.  Becky is very attentive to all individual needs, gives advice and answers questions any time, is always smiling and keeping our momentum going, giving us praise and supporting us all the way through!  I wish I had found Becky and Fox Fitness sooner.  I love how it has changed my health and my attitude!"}
{"input": "Went here for the Ansel Adams exhibit which was great! Very nice set up and lots of prints all by Ansel Adams himself. I did not get to spend much time looking at the other exhibits but I will have to return. If you are a fan of Native American art then this is must-do if you are in Indianapolis."}
{"input": "Carrot cake was amazing. Crave it every day since I had it. Doesn't even compare to previous cakes I've had."}
{"input": "Yessiree!!  This place is truly my new favorite place to eat in St. Petersburg!  Small and intimate, with a cool rustic elegant vibe.  We showed up at 6:15 with no reservation and walked right in. By 6:30 there was a line at the door and an hour wait. The menu offers an eclectic mix and it all looked amazing!  We had the short rib appetizer to start. Which was glazed in an Asian sauce with a little kick yum!!. My husband had pasta with a white sauce which I swear he hummed with delight thru every bite. I kept it simple with a burger which I was told would be life changing. They weren't kidding! I have dreamt of it nightly since our visit. Will I go back?  Hell yeah!  I'd camp out for this place !!"}
{"input": "Great crust and great toppings make this one of the best pizza spots in Ardmore."}
{"input": "I went there for the first time on Tuesday.  The pain in my shoulders and neck diminished 80% by the next day and I also slept for 9 hours that night!  \nThe tables were also really comfortable:)"}
{"input": "This calzone shop offers an array of calzones and sauces on the side to choose from. There are enough options to offer variety but not so many that younger overwhelmed. The atmosphere is great with several community tables or tables to easily seat larger parties. We went at dinner time on a Saturday and had no problem finding a seat."}
{"input": "Great service, intimate vibe for a date night, but I have to dock one star because our main dishes were disappointing and the dessert. There was nothing that stood out about the sea bass and risotto. The risotto dish was quite bland to be honest it was as if it were made for patients on a low sodium diet...so if you're on a low sodium diet, I recommend trying that! The amuse buche and mushroom bisque were delicious and the bread is tasty-they have a wide selection. The crab cake wasn't too exciting but not bad either, right in the middle. Another surprise was the flourless chocolate cake. You would think it would be light, airy, and not too sweet. Think again, I felt instant cavities forming because it was extremely sweet. With that said, not sure if we will be back, but I guess it is worth another try since so many people raven about the restaurant."}
{"input": "There's a room here that you've just GOT to see.\n\nI absolutely love the IMA.  Adore it, even.  Remember that campaign they ran a few years ago - \"It's MY Art\"?  I totally embrace that.  There's truly something for everyone here from the stellar European gallery to the cutting edge contemporary art.  The 100 Acres and outdoor gardens simply can't be missed.  Oh, and don't forget to take a day and visit the Lilly mansion.  It's breathtaking.  \n\nDid I mention the best part, yet?  It's all FREE!!!  You get to experience art, and you get to experience art, and YOU get to experience art! (In my Oprah Winfrey Voice, lol)\n\nIf you haven't visited the IMA recently, make an effort to go ASAP-tually.  They're open late (until 9) on Thursdays!\n\nOh, and about that room?  Ask for James Turrell.  It's the ONE piece of art that you actually get to touch. ;-)"}
{"input": "Seriously the best pizza I think I've ever had! The crust was crunchy, the cheese was gooey, the prices were fair, and the sauce was yummy! I like that this place can accommodate large families or birthday parties like for kiddos, but they also have a bar in the back. There are TVs all around playing different games which is also nice. There is a tiny arcade in the back too. We shall definitely be back!"}
{"input": "A healthy and refreshing alternative to an unhealthy NOLA treat.  Beaucoup Juice offers a variety of snoballs, smoothies, and even sandwiches.  All their treats are made with freshly squeezed juices, so you don't have to worry about getting a major sugar rush.  I came here with my sister one afternoon looking for a healthy treat.  I ordered the pineapple mint snoball and she got the Mardi Gras Mango smoothie.  We both enjoyed our yummy treats!  The pineapple mint was so unique and refreshing.  I love when places mix mint with other fruits!\n\nIf you're looking for a traditional snoball, this is not the place for you!  You can find a delicious, sugar-filled snoball at Hansen's if you're looking for that.\n\nBeaucoup Juice is very cute and small.  I find it to be a sort of hipster/retro place with its bright colors and art.  I will definitely be back whenever I have a craving for snoballs."}
{"input": "Yup everything they say it is. So good. Great service. Amazing food. It can be affordable but when you go there go all out. It's worth it!"}
{"input": "I am so excited about this hotel. It is really a hidden gem. We arrived at 8:30 am, planning to store our luggage until check-in time. The very friendly lady at the front desk, gave us a room immediately. She was very kind. They had a guy take up all of our luggage. He was very friendly. Once in the room, I discovered a nice room, nice tv, and best of all, AVEDA bath products. They even leave guest a travel kit with cotton balls, q-tips, and a finger file which we really needed after a seven day cruise. Hands down, best hotel I have stayed at, and I have stayed at many. If and when I return, I will be staying here for sure!!!"}
{"input": "Great food. Did take out for our first ever order. Amazing food!  The Meing Cum sounds weird but was one if the best things I've ever had. Chicken satay was great too. Will definitely be ordering again. My husband can't stop raving about the Drunken Noodles."}
{"input": "BrightNow Dental was an ok dentist until I made an appointment & went in that morning at my scheduled time just to be turned away because I missed an appointment a few months before. Which was because of family emergencies. I even called & left messages on their answering machines to reschedule & they never called me back. So my tooth started hurting really bad & I made an appointment. Went in & the dentist turned me away with an excruciating hurting tooth just bcuz I missed an appointment a few months before. I've never been turned away from a doctor or dentist before. I found it to be very unprofessional from the dentist standpoint because he didn't even talk to me. The assistant did. I will never go back & I will not recommend this dentist to anyone."}
{"input": "Amazingly good nachos with beef, I would go here just to get them. Pulled pork sandwich was very good too. Tons of good looking items on the menu. I tried to goto brunch on sunday and the wait was 2 hours so go early if you want breakfast or your gonna be waiting sucka."}
{"input": "Great food and atmosphere. Cobb salad is awesome. Would definitely recommend this establishment."}
{"input": "This place is not to be trusted. I came in with my brother and said I would co-sign a lease for him when they came back with numbers inflated 3 times what the Hyundai site advertises. We walked off the lot. They kept calling my brother telling him to come in they would do the deal at that advertised price. UNBEKNOWNST to me they ran the entire lease under my social without my permission and told me as after the paperwork was signed. SCUM BAGS. I called the next day to complain and they blew me off for two weeks straight with excuse until the tags were released\n\n DON\"T GO HERE. they are DIRTY. We own a car dealership and I happen to know tags do not drop 36 hours after being tricked into signing a lease contract on my good credit when it was supposed to go in the other persons name. \n\nI am getting an attorney and suing for fraud."}
{"input": "I live in the area and am thrilled ot have live music 5 nights/week.  We have eaten here for both brunch and dinner--both were very good, not standard bar fare at all.  They are reaching for gastropub and some of the menu hits it squarely,.  The Onion Tart and Vegetarian Shephard's Pie, for instance.  Wonderful vibe inside.  And did we mention the live music...a juke joint on Headhouse Square...c'mon people, you gotta love THAT."}
{"input": "Came here for lunch on a very cold day, convenient location right around the corner from my office. A had a few co-workers tag along so we ordered to-go.\n\nIt's nice they have two options for ordering, a self serve kiosk as well as though a cashier. We all opted for the kiosk. \n\nReally interesting the deluxe pho is the same price as all of the others. I found this as a bonus because I prefer multiple goodies over choosing only one protein.\n\nService was quick but we found ourselves waiting around for those who ordered bahn mi sandwiches. When we got back to the office everything was packaged great, no spills etc. I liked that they give you all the sprouts, noodles, basil etc in a separate bowl...however you'll find at the bottom of that bowl is a tiny plastic cup of hoisin. Not sure why they decide to hide it at the bottom, but some of my overeager coworkers poured their broth in before fishing it out!\n\nI was really happy with the pho I thought it was super flavorful and I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"input": "Came in here after our red-eye flight. We were so grateful they were open already.  We ordered their eggs benedict style Arnold , banana's foster French toast, chocolate chip pancake, eggs, and bacon and hot chocolates.  The hot chocolate just hit the spot for me. I finished it almost immediately. The food was delish!!!! I shared the eggs benedict and French toast with my hubby.  They were both bomb.  It was just the right portion for us to share too.  I was hoping we could go back there again for breakfast but time was not kind to us.  We will definitely come back here when we are in the area."}
{"input": "Wonderful clean eating type cafe. We were looking for some healthier breakfast options and found it here. Smaller place down a side street but very worth it. Excellent quality smoothies and bagels were just so much more flavorful than the chain type places. Highly recommend."}
{"input": "Excellent service. Waitress took the time to walk us through vegetarian and pescatarian menu options. Willing to adjust menu items to satisfy our requests. Ordered a Banh Mi sandwich and bread was fresh from the oven - delicious! Ordered the fresh spring rolls with shrimp and green tea. Besides the great food the restaurant is clean as a whistle."}
{"input": "I just ordered a keg for my daughters first birthday party. How easy was this you ask.... Way to easy and at a great value!!!! A 1/2 keg gives about 160 12oz drinks! At $150 ( Heineken) that's $1 a beer!!!!!  You can rent the keg for as long as you need.  But the beer begins to degrade after a day or 2 if you don't have a kegerartor. But I'm pretty sure a few keg stands will solve the problem of any left overs.  Not only do they provide a keg with a large list of beers for your to order.  You can ask to rent a tub ( to keep it cold) and the pump.  There are deposits for these items. But will get it back once returned.  Really makes me want to look into buying a kegerartor now. I would totally keep a keg next to bed.\n\n\nNot only can you choose from a great selection of beers. There are also different size kegs you could order depending on your needs.  Love this great service.  Thank you for keeping Tampa slightly tipsy total wine. Life and spirits go great together!"}
{"input": "Ordered lunch for delivery to Rittenhouse via Eat24. Took about an hour as estimated. Food needed more flavoring and seasoning, but not bad."}
{"input": "My husband and I live around the corner and dine here a few times a month. We always sit in the bar because the staff there is phenominal! Great food and great prices too!"}
{"input": "This place is outstanding. Best restaurant in Tampa! We ordered the Caribbean plate with Jamaican jerk, curry and stew chicken.  The chicken was the most tender and soft! The flavor was wonderful and unique. Delicious !! Service by Andre is top notch and he's attentive and genuinely cares about his customers! I highly recommend to all!!!"}
{"input": "Lots of great beer! Yum yum! Neat 'feel' to this place. We ended up arriving just before a tarential downpour, so we couldn't sit outside, but they have lots of outdoor seating if you can stand the heat/humidity. Staff very nice. I rarely give 5 starts, but i just enjoyed this place so much.... Lots of 'locals' playing board games and cards. An over all great place for drink. They even have a few wine choices."}
{"input": "If you love Chicago style pizza this is the place to go. This is the closest I've found to the real deal, but be prepared to wait and get there early because it fills up really fast."}
{"input": "Obviously they are doing something right since they have been around since 1958. Great soft serve and scooped ice cream cones, boats, floats and sundaes.\nPrices great too.  Enjoy!"}
{"input": "Great pedicure - still looks good over 2 1/2 weeks later. Sunday hours are a big bonus. Quick service even though we didn't have appointments. I'd definitely come back."}
{"input": "This is a really nice Subway. It has far too little parking. The manager & staff were making the best of National Sandwich Day. Customers were everywhere.\nMy BOGO subs were great. We got the spicy Italian & the tuna. Their tuna really is done just right! Not swimming in mayo a good taste.\nThe spicy Italian was new to me but, quite good.\nWhat's a girl to do. Love Subway + a BOGO & I am a happy camper."}
{"input": "Had my phone inside a LIFEPROOF case and less than a week later, accidentally dropped it on a CARPETED floor and the screen shattered. Not so impressed anymore.\n\nOh, and it took a day or so to really notice, but their reinstallation include a slanted home button. (Is this related to the enormous shatter across the new screen, Apple people?)"}
{"input": "Not only was the driver reckless and erratic in his driving (I had my three-year-old with me, and he was turning corners like we were in a Hollywood car chase), he blasted vile right-wing propaganda--i.e. Sean Hannity--at earsplitting volume right behind my head the whole way. By the time we arrived at our destination, my blood pressure was off the scale. If you want tips and repeat business, DO NOT torture your passengers."}
{"input": "I love Roma burgers, I try to have one in every city I visit but this location butchered the Roma burger. Over cooked the usually mouth melting burger so it was tough. Over toasted the bun so it was tough.\nA shame. Next time I will try a different location."}
{"input": "My husband and I go to A Matter of Taste every Sunday for brunch. We have never been disappointed. The food is outstanding. Personally, we think the food is UNDER priced. We love the GF biscuits with blueberry preserves and the huevos rancheros. The owner is always friendly and very accommodating. We love this little nook in our neighborhood."}
{"input": "Great beers and good atmosphere.  This was my first time in, I finally made it.  Loved it.  I want to go back and try more beers."}
{"input": "Came here for my birthday and everything flowed so smoothly. I started off with a bottle of rose and never had an empty glass. My booth was in the corner and had a beautiful view of the city. We started out with the cheesesteak nachos and they were delicious. The chips were airy and made in house earlier that day. For my meal I had short rib with filet. The meat was so tender and cut so smoothly. I paired it with the Brussels sprouts and it was the most delicious thing I've had. They had wild rice in the middle and the right amount of saltiness. My waiter nick made sure our glasses were full the entire time and kept up with clearing the table. The dessert cake out with a happy birthday message. It was an expensive evening, but worth it for the atmosphere and high quality service."}
{"input": "There's nothing better than fat Belgium cut fries that are slightly too greasy to compliment a very skinny hot dog laden with pickles and mustard. \n\nAs much as I'm woe to admit this, 15 years after indulging in my last hot dog, I was expecting something of bratwurst - or at least ball park - thickness. The dogs were good. The bacon wrapped dog made it better.\n\nThe buns are okay.\n\nBut Hot Diggity is made by its delicious fries - eat them with the vinegar sauce...and only the vinegar sauce. Everything else tastes like the same sour, sweet, or spicy variation of Kewpie. \n\nThe sodas are fun - the unfiltered Ginger ale with real chunks of ginger floating around is unique and tastes more healthy than harmful. (No, doctor, I swear, all I had to drink was heart healthy ginger....)"}
{"input": "Well worth the wait! My mother and I went on a Monday morning around 9am. The wait was about 20 minutes. We thought we were going to have to wait for hours, but we were pleasantly surprised. The line moved really fast for us! Our waitress, Michelle, was incredibly welcoming and helpful. She made our experience at The Pancake Pantry top notch. Please do yourself a favor and order the sweet potato pancakes and pair them with the cinnamon cream. Out of this world!"}
{"input": "Went the other night in a group of 13.  We had a great time.  Chef Poon is so much fun.  You can tell he truly has a passion of the culinary arts.  The best part you feel like your actually eating in the chefs kitchen.  My only suggestion is bring a big appetite because there is so much food."}
{"input": "This place was pretty cool. The decor will remind you of the great gatsby. Their pesto sauce is delicious and they make their own soda syrup. Only reason it didn't get 5 stars was that it took a while for someone to come and ask what we wanted to drink. The food we got was very good though. It is a place I would visit again if I get back to St. Louis. Would want to try their ice cream cocktails."}
{"input": "Bacchanal Wine - one of the things that always serves to remind me what it is that I love about New Orleans.  Laid back, quirky, comfortable in its own skin - and some of the best damn food you'll ever eat."}
{"input": "I just moved in nearby so my friends and I stopped in La Va for a mid-moving rest/lunch,  We were a little disappointed but not entirely let down.  The place itself has a good vibe so I'd consider going back to hang out with a coffee.  \n\nWe ordered sandwiches because we were starving after moving all morning.  The menu looked great but unfortunately everything I tried to order they \"didn't have on sundays\".  The staff wasn't very helpful in explaining what they were serving and couldn't suggest suitable alternatives.  Both my friend and I got the mozzarella panini.  It wasn't made the way it was described on the menu and neither of them were hot (or even warm).  \n\nI can't speak to how the drinks were but my friends seemed to enjoy their coffee drinks.  I'd be willing to give this place another try, probably not on a Sunday though."}
{"input": "The server was very friendly and patient with are endless questions. The baby back ribs were very tasty and not over cooked. The wings were great... From a self proclaimed wing expert! The tri-tip was good. The atmosphere was mild which was perfect, not super loud, for my 4 month old. Would defiantly go again. Would have gotten 5 stars if they weren't out of some of the foods."}
{"input": "Came by for a late breakfast of blueberry pancakes. They were great pancakes with the blueberries in the batter and blueberry syrup with blue berries in them also. The three pancakes were huge and delicious. It was all in Cracker Barrel style, it was cool so the fire place was burning. We will be back."}
{"input": "Fantastic Greek food at reasonable prices.  The lamb dishes were particularly good."}
{"input": "Ive eaten here 3 of the last 5 days!! Food is great and the people are really nice! Ive only had the vermicelli bowl so far but i overheard the couple next to me really enjoying their phó."}
{"input": "The sizes and flavor of the endless sushi rolls are perfect. I got a Rainbow Roll, Rock & Roll, & some nigiri on top of miso soup & gyoza. The only thing mediocre was the gyoza, but the amazing service, great wine choices, and fresh fish make up for that. If I lived here I would come here 3 times a week! It's not every day you have great food, reasonable prices, & amazing service."}
{"input": "Great neighborhood bar, with a casual atmosphere.  This place is always extremely clean and the staff is always friendly and cheerful.  \n\nVillage Pub offers a good selection of beers which are priced very well.  Style points awarded for serving the Dark & Stormy in vintage pewter mugs.  In regards to food offerings, don't forget to try the Italian Sausages, they are incredible!"}
{"input": "Being from Cincinnati we know ipas and urban south has the best ones we've found in Nola. Brewery is casual and low key."}
{"input": "Really liked this store yesterday. Great selection, I was impressed by Chloe and Marc Jacobs items and Chanel pumps for $87 (too small for me=(\nI found their price range great (now they have summer sales on) but in general you get great value for money. I am not looking for $20-30 T Shirts, I am ready to pay $100 for a silky blouse (which can retail for $300+) so I guess this will be my go-to store. \nAnd! the lady at the store was super friendly and nice."}
{"input": "The portion was good sized, but the taste was nothing to write home about. Service was lackluster...but my coffee cup never emptied which was a plus. The restaurant itself was super noisy and cluttered with nic-nacks.  With other tastier and friendlier options in Tucson, probably will not return."}
{"input": "Customer service ALONE could have made this NEGATIVE stars. As previously mention the manager nick Patel is a total douche. We stay in hotels almost every single day: sooo you'd think we know our stuff when it comes to these places. He practically told us not to stay bc of the price we got online. Completely RUDE. We were however desperate at this point bc everything else was booked. AND there were gummy worms left from the last guest so I'm guessing the rest of the staff follows suit from the shitty management.. EW"}
{"input": "Stayed here over the last 2 nights and this place is lovely. We stayed in the San Miguel bungalow. It has a very comfortable bed, a small kitchen are with microwave, small refrigerator, coffee machine. The shower has a double head and there is a jacuzzi tub in the bedroom. It was really nice. We had room service for breakfast on the first morning and it was delivered on time and was pretty good. The place is clean and nicely decorated. The main house is pretty and has a nice restaurant. Everyone was nice and helpful when we asked for directions or restaurant recommendations. This venue is close to lots of restaurants, the wharf and shopping, great location.  We are already thinking about when we can plan a return visit."}
{"input": "I really like this Petsmart - although it is definitely on the more expensive side.  They have a great selection of items and the shelves are always stocked well.  I take my dogs to this location for their grooming and they've always done an amazing job with them.  The few concerns about the store is it's really not laid out very well for the amount of foot traffic they receive and there never seems to be enough help at the cash registers.  Even with those issues though I'll definitely be back."}
{"input": "Been to NOLA a bunch of times, but just stumbled upon this little Whitman-loving spot this year. I absolutely adore the writing theme present throughout the space, from the literary menu to the vintage typewriters lining the walls. It's very charming!\n\nI had a Moscow Mule which was delicious. I THINK I also had a \"Death In The Morning\" (absinthe and champagne). Tasty but a little too strong for me ... my own fault of course, the name speaks for itself.\n\nWe stopped here more than once during this trip. It's just a cozy little spot. Perfect to grab a drink, admire the books on the mantle and sit on a squishy chair by the fireplace. Friendly bartenders too!"}
{"input": "Yum! This is a great place to go with a few friends to share their delicious and nicely portioned cheese while enjoying a beer from their extensive drink list. 5 stars purely because of how much I loved their cheese selection and appreciated the staff's knowledge of each cheese.  I'd happily go back although this is not a place I'd go to have inexpensive drinks."}
{"input": "I am such a big fan of DSW but for some reason I don't care much for this one.  I mean it is decent, but when I went to the one in Marlton 2 days later, I found even more shoes I liked and even better quality in the clearance section.  I was kind of upset by the new layout because it actually feels more like a warehouse when I never got that feel before.  Not many people asked if I needed help or even paid me much attention which was annoying too"}
{"input": "Delicious! We had the warm and cold lobster rolls and both were great.  Bread was amazing too!  A little on the expensive side but you get what you pay for and it was quality food."}
{"input": "The staff was so kind, the food was delicious, and I love the location. I highly recommend the mojito and the cassoulet!"}
{"input": "The service here is terrible. After a fill in my nail and the acrylic cracked in half there he used the blade. I called up there and the man who answered said they'll fix it. Once I got there they tried to charge me 10 to fix something that was their fault. Then the man at station 5 caught an attitude because I wouldn't let him pull my broken nail off that was still connected to my skin. He then told me he wasn't fixing my nail."}
{"input": "Josef's did our wedding cake, it was absolutely incredible!!!! Both the cake and the design.  The custom airbrushed fondant leaves and branches to match our invitations were amazing!  The fondant was perfectly thin on the outside of the cake.  It was delivered precisely on time and was just amazing!!! Couldn't have been happier!\n\nI also have to say we love their breakfasts!!! Super delicious!"}
{"input": "The sausage stuffed mushrooms are divine, but the presentation of them was a little lack-luster. The beer list is impressive and the gluten-free pizza is incredibly tasty.  Hip interior, fun menu, and friendly service. 5 stars are a rarity from me, but the tasty dark beer on tap, the thirst-quinching sangria my wife had, the gluten free option crust pizza with delicious flavor made it an easy 5 star from me."}
{"input": "This is one of our favorite spots in Nashville.  It has recently been remodeled and looks great!  The patio can get loud, but other than that no complaints."}
{"input": "Over the weekend, my fiancé and I joined our friends for a fantastic meal here. The owners and staff were extremely friendly and provided excellent service. We tried quite a few rolls, and I definitely recommend the Japican and Blossom, really delicious. The nigiri and quail egg shooters were great and fresh, too. We'll have to try the coconut ice cream when we come back since they were out, but the green tea flavor was a perfect way to conclude the sushi feast we had. :)\n\nWe will definitely be back, so glad this location opened up so close saving us the drive down to Carson City!"}
{"input": "Well its not the Magazine st location for sure. I had the smoked salmon, shrimp rolls and calamari. The rolls were dry I ate some & the calamari tasted like they were really those knockoff pork rectum rings but maybe that's just what they serve at happy hour. Regardless it was poo along with the service. I'll pass on this location."}
{"input": "The coconut drink I got was awesome. The empanadillas were good, but how are you gonna mess up putting meat in a fried bread pocket? No complaints about the seared tuna. I thought the plantain fritters were a little bland, but the mashed up ones were really good. The service was a little slow at times, and they forgot our sauce for the second round of plantains, but otherwise pretty good, especially for it being a relatively new place. I'm guessing some kinks are still being worked out."}
{"input": "I had a small snafu with the Yelp coupon but after that? Food....and it was excellent.  The chicken caeser salad was great and heavy on the chicken.  The subs were fresh and tasty.   And, yes, they have beer!   But I had an old-fashioned Dr. Brown's cream soda because they have all their flavors.   Nicely located.   Just a mile from the Wagon Wheel flea market."}
{"input": "The pizza was great. My new favorite. A great addition to the flavor of South Grand. The owner truly cares about the quality of his product. I would recommend natty's to anyone. Truly a South Grand destination."}
{"input": "This is a great place to grab a drink. My friends and I went on a Thursday around 6 and it wasn't too crowded. They have a great variety of fancy cocktails, beer, wine, and a selection of small bites. I love the decor. The seating is made up of couches and a variety of mixmatched chairs paired with wood tables. If you like brandy the fish house punch is good. I'm more of a vodka gal so I really enjoyed the moscow mule."}
{"input": "Went here with my hubby for a couples massage for our 6 year anniversary.  I'm pregnant and scheduled the pre-natal massage and wasn't sure what to expect with this being my first pregnancy.  Jeanne took amazing care of me and I cannot wait to go back!  She talked me through the massage since it is a little different than your typical treatment and had these awesome comfy pillows/pads that allowed me to lay on my stomach.  As a former stomach sleeper I could not have been more comfortable and relaxed.  The 60 minute massage left me feeling great and I will definitely be back.  Love love love Jeanne!!!  \n\nOh - My husband had Victoria for a Swedish massage and was pleased with his service as well.  He didn't have the benefits of the comfy maternity pillows but he was still impressed  =) \n\nGreat place, worth the money."}
{"input": "Decent hotel in downtown Tampa. Stayed in the suite with the fold out couch.  This place has a happy hour with FREE drinks, which we missed, but how cool. The complimentary breakfast was awesome.  Made to order omelets, fresh fruit, cereal, toast, bacon, sausage, home fries, juice and pastries.  Did I mention it was complimentary?   Easiest the best free breakfast I've ever had.  Room was nice and modern with two TV's etc.  Clean and a strong shower."}
{"input": "Wonderful company to do business with. We had two homes outside of Tucson that were left in questionable condition after a bad contractor had his way with them and needed a reputable licensed electrician to go over everything with a fine toothed comb. Bonnie understood our situation as we already had a buyer for the home, ready to move in and needed to address any potential issues ASAP. She sent us Anthony, a wonderful guy who really knows his stuff. He did a thorough job of reviewing the entire service, including the breaker boxes, lines throughout each structure as well as the outlets and switches. One week later he was out addressing each item that was a cause of concern so that we could hand over the keys to our buyer with confidence, knowing that the homes were safe and fully operational. I highly recommend Buddy Heilig & Sons to anyone in the local Tucson area needing electric service!"}
{"input": "Terrible customer service! I tried to place an order for delivery and was told the chef that makes the dinners has left and she did not know when he would return.  I asked what that meant and she said you can't have a dinner.So then she offered me chicken parmigiana- which is a dinner.....so I was confused and she laughed at me! Apparently that was funny to her. Furthermore when I asked who I was speaking to she wouldn't give me her name. I asked 3 times. I said forget it I'm not sure what is going on here, but I'm not ordering food from a place that is rude. I called back to speak to the owner or manager- they were not there. I will not order from there ever and I am new to the area!"}
{"input": "The area that I grew up at had a town after town with small historical inns, B&Bs, and restaurants that served good comforting American food in a quaint rustic setting.  Some of the special ones in my memory seemed to reflect the love that the people running the place had for their small establishment.\n\nHendel's is that special kind of place.\n\nWhen a coworker convinced me to eat there for lunch, I thought, \"Where the hell are you taking me?!\" as he turned off Lindbergh onto some seemingly random local roads.  I found myself in an area untouched by the familiar quazi-ghetto strip malls that I felt personified Florissant.\n\nEating outside is a huge recommendation on the patio with the well tended garden and the overall cozy feel of the place.  The service is friendly and the food is very good, but nothing spectacular.  \n\nRegardless, if you're in the area, you should check this place out.  You'll definitely be going back again."}
{"input": "I really have loved the experience every time I go into Body Fuel! The staff are always welcoming and full of advice. It's truly a great environment. The Acai Bowls are top notch!"}
{"input": "Mike the restroom attendant made my night!!! And eddy the manager is  seriously down to earth!!"}
{"input": "This is the worst place to eat! I love barbecue and the pulled pork was so dry I had to drown it in barbecue sauce to try and eat it! The wings were so dry, the collard greens were so bland that I had to put buffalo sauce and salt to make them taste somewhat decent. The food came out slow and we were starving. It was edible, that's about it! Had to place a order to go at tarpon tavern because I was still hungry after eating what little I had!"}
{"input": "Very good pizza The owner is wonderful The place is renovated , everyone seems to be friendly really want you to enjoy your food French fries are good salad and also the chicken fingers i'm a vegetarian so I don't know too much of the other meals but I do know everything else is good and my kids love the chicken fingers"}
{"input": "Yummmmmm.  Some of the best sushi in Reno!! By far the best and most friendly service. I would recommend everyone to give this place a chance."}
{"input": "Really good burger. I had the Bourbon Black and Bleu. It was cooked like I wanted and very tasty. \n\nI gave them 3 stars for the wait. We had a big party - 4 adults and 5 kids - and it took over an hour to get our food. Shouldn't have taken that long, regardless of how many people were at our table."}
{"input": "I really enjoyed going to Hollygrove. It was fun for my family to pick out the vegetables for our box. What I really love is that we had a lot of items in our box that we wouldn't necessarily pick out at the grocery store, which lead to creating some delicious and healthy meals. The one thing I didn't like was that some of the food was on its last legs when we cut into it, which meant half went into the garbage. I have to make it clear that we cut into it the day we picked up the box. Anyhow, I cannot wait to go back"}
{"input": "My partner and I had a really great experience with Keswick Cycle. Super knowledgeable staff, really kind and helpful and very fair prices. We dragged 2 bikes out of my garage that had been in there for at least 5 years, and were able to get everything we needed to have them in great working order--two tunesups (one each) helmets, bike lights, and great locks, which they even helped us fit to our bikes and installed the holsters for the lights and locks free of charge. They fixed my broken chain, adjusted my kickstand, and aligned everything, fixed the tires, etc. They appraised the bikes so we'd know how much we can sell them for when we're done with them or when we move as long as they stay in good condition.\n\nI highly recommend Keswick Cycle."}
{"input": "My group came on a rainy night so maybe we missed what all the fuss is about. Felt like there were too many rules- no moving bar stools onto the patio - you order first but then find a place to sit and come back to get a number for your food. No smoking allowed outside on the patio. Really really slow service. Ambiance was only ok... music inside was so loud you couldn't talk."}
{"input": "Whoops, there's more than one location, isn't there? I'm afraid I don't know Tucson well enough to know which one I went to, but either way it was a wicked cool place!!!\n\nYou may have to sign a waiting list to get helped, but they are quick to get to you even when they're packed full of other people waiting and at no time did I feel as if I was being rushed while asking questions. \n\nTruly great customer service!!! \n\nI'd go back again, but it is 5000 miles from home for me so I'll have to use their website instead!!!"}
{"input": "Very nice deco friendly staff. Took a little staycation sometimes u need that. Room since and clean, had a wonderful view went shopping at the fashion mall. Nice"}
{"input": "Still running on EST, we arrived @8:30 on a Saturday to find no wait to be seated OR helped, ordering up the sweet potato pancakes with cinnamon cream syrup (good topped with excellent) with some borderline awful hash browns (really, people??). Can't say I'd return even without a wait, though; would prefer to just buy a jar of the syrup and apply it at home. Ended up at $24.43 pre-tip; no paper towels in the restroom and the day had barely started, so that was probably a dogshow."}
{"input": "Beautiful, upscale, great location, great service, love the rooms, the restaurant is pricey but excellent."}
{"input": "Clean facility, plenty of color selection and did a nice job painting but pedicure was costly for a basic pedicure. $28 for basic pedicure and $5 additional for removing of callus; $33 total not including tip seems really steep. Most nail facilities charge $25 for basic pedicure and callus removal is included. \n\nBasic pedicure should also include lotion MASSAGE-instead it is gently applied then your feet are back in the water with lotion not completely rubbed in.  waste of product if you ask me. \n\nI will try other places before returning."}
{"input": "Favorite caffe from now on, green apple ade plus banana walnut honey bread. Wow out of this world. Omg the smell of the banana cake is wow and did you see the packages presentation"}
{"input": "I would not recommend Prime 108. Nothing special here. Food was mediocre & service was marginal. The menu and wine list are limited. The hotel lobby, fireplace and restaurant are rich and luxurious. The location has amazing potential but this restaurant is a total miss."}
{"input": "Great spot for pho! Broth is very good. I ordered No. 51 (small) and it was filling. Would definitely come back again when I'm in Philly."}
{"input": "I have been ordering take out from this place for several years. The place is clean, good people and food is very good. They are one of the few Chinese places from where I take out sea food. I have tried almost all the items in the menu over the years and have no complaints. I am a low spice guy and like their chicken fried rice a lot. I will definitely recommend this place for take outs atleast since I have never had a sit in there."}
{"input": "This is your typical large conference hotel. I came here for business and stayed six nights. I found that the staff was not customer service centric - probably because their occupancy was so high and maybe they felt like they didn't have to earn our business. \n\nHere are the things that could have been better:\n\n-I pre-ordered breakfast everyday via room service. It was consistently late (everyday) and they overcharged me - twice. When it came to check out, I expected the front desk to at least offer some kind of compensation for their oversight but they didn't. \n\n-The printer at the Business Center ran out of ink. They said it would take a week to replace the cartridge. \n\n-Front desk staff didn't seem to have a customer focus."}
{"input": "Amazing BBQ. The smoked pork sandwich was one of the best that I have had in years. AND the Onion Rings were definitely THE BEST in St. Louis. We will definitely be coming. back."}
{"input": "Great ice cream, speedy service. They let you sample flavors which is handy because they have a ton!"}
{"input": "Great place for really good Greek dining.  Even though touristy area, this is authentic Greek food served with care and excellent ingredients.  Very fair prices too. Nice Greek wine list with beers and Greek liquors.  Staff is knowledgeable and very helpful.  We've been here several times and never disappointed.   Busy place but they handle it well.  Great appetizers (ump-Pagels) and big selection of great Greek dessert.  We shared a Gyro platter with 3 appetizers and dessert and price was less than $40.  Great buy for exquisite lunch.   I will return."}
{"input": "So far so good just moved into this area and so far they have really good food and ok service and the chicken cheese steaks are to die for"}
{"input": "Best Greek Salad I have had outside of Greece!!! Always my go to place when I am in town! \nGreat service and great food!!"}
{"input": "Just wanted to drop a quick review and say if you haven't gotten ice cream from here yet, you are missing out! It's all homemade, he has different flavor selections based on the seasons, and he let's you try lots of different flavors till you get just the right one! Love the customer service and quality of the ice cream!"}
{"input": "Try the Green Bloody Mary!  Creative twist on a classic. Got a delayed kick, but it's a good one."}
{"input": "I have had the sundae pudding, which is a banana bread pudding with walnuts. It is so amazing. My partner got the no Nana pudding, which is vanilla pudding. It was good, but the bananas and walnuts make it better. I also got the walnut brownies which were really good too. Next time, I will try the cupcakes; they look perfect."}
{"input": "Overpriced for average food served warm (not hot) by servers who had trouble saying the names of the dishes and seemed in a rush to give us our bill when the place was more than half empty (on a Saturday night). When one of the servers came over to check on the $23 pork chop (which was not listed in the menu - $18 price was), my spouse commented there was a lot of fat....she seemed baffled by his comment, then walked away! The \"ropa vieja\" dish was good, but overpriced for being served in moderate portion. The menu prices did not reflect the ambiance (random plastic container boxes placed on a nearby table nor the sagging knitted item hanging over our table - it looks like there should've been a lamp in it)."}
{"input": "My revisit update offers the same rating, for different reasons.  This is still a pretty expensive burger place...maybe get rid of one of the guys and lower the price 20%. ;) \n\nThe burgers are real good and the toppings make it super delicious.\n\nOn this visit my bacon cheeseburger was somewhat baconless...it had three small chips of bacon, like it was the last pieces left.\n\nApparently visiting after dinner is a no-no."}
{"input": "The guys in the deli are slow! All they do is talk and look around trying to avoid work. If you buy produce there eat it fast it does not stay fresh very long"}
{"input": "I have been looking for a new dentist for awhile and always saw this one when visiting my bank. I finally decided to try it out with the new patient cleaning/x-ray special they have and I am very glad that I did. I was having a problem as well with one tooth and didn't know what to expect from a new dentist but I was very happy when Dr Su told me that nothing was wrong with it. I'm always nervous when seeing a new Dr in general so its reassuring when they tell you everything looks great. The staff from the time I walked in to the time I left were very friendly and caring and I really liked Dr Su. They all listened to my questions and answered them with sincerity. I would definitely recommend them and can honestly say that I am very pleased that I found my new dentist. Definitely 5 stars!"}
{"input": "Been here a couple of times and it's never bad. Crab fries are always a good choice, but I think they might want to try to remake the cheese so that it doesn't harden so quickly for dipping. Awesome sports bar for the guys and the place is always packed. I love the atmosphere. \n\nCan't ever go wrong with their huge portions of mussels for such a good price! Got the chickie's riverboat clams before, not really worth the money and they were okay. chicken parm sandwich is alright. The magooby sounds weird (contains shrimp, pickles, fries, onions, cheese), but it was actually a very interesting combo and i liked it. the lobster cheesesteak is alright (lol doesn't really taste different from the regular cheeseteaks though)\n\nwill be back from time to time!"}
{"input": "Had a group of 8 eat at ECP. Service was quick even though their was a full house.  \nFood was good pizza, pasta and salads were ordered.  They will customized if you ask. Romaine instead of iceberg lettuce ad well done pizza. There loyalty program reward frequent diners with free items.  Nice place for a casual meal out!"}
{"input": "I am always skeptical of Restaurant Week... You never know what service or the food will be like but you go in with that in mind... WELL fellow Yelpers.. I must say that I was surprisingly blown away by both! \n\nWe had a reservation for 6 but at the last minute we had another guest join us. When I called the restaurant to make sure it was ok, the gentlemen was more than happy to add one to our reservation.  Upon arrival we headed to the bar to wait for the rest of our group to arrive.  Bar menu was great, they have a lot of bottled beers to choose from...no drafts.. weird..\n\nThe food was really good!  For restaurant week I never have my hopes set too high...ist that bad??  I started with the Ceasar Salad, then the Ribeye and for dessert I ordered the Chocolate cake.. Salad was yummy, steak was done to perfection!!  I was not at all pleased with the chocolate cake (i love cake) BUT my friends bread pudding was pretty tasty!  \n\nWe will definitely return.  Our server Melissa was really sweet too!"}
{"input": "Being a Missouri girl, I was raised on BBQ. Eli knows how to bbq. It's all about the meat and the smoke. The ribs are my favorite. They are tender, pulling off the bone just right. The chicken, sides and bbq sauce are great but the meat is the KING."}
{"input": "Good food, parking hard to find. Great for businesses lunch. Great historic building. I had short ribs definitely going to order again."}
{"input": "I had the Wheat Berry Salad, sooooo amazing! The bartender, not sure of his name, took great care of me and was so sweet! Love this place."}
{"input": "Exactly as bougie and casual at the same time as you need it to be. Come with your Gucci bag or in your yoga pants and slam a delicious cocktail or three."}
{"input": "Tony Ray Baker and his team are amazing.   I am in a position where I need to sell my home for health reasons, and I have gotten A plus service from Tony Ray Baker.   I love my home, but life has mad it impossible for me to  maintain a home due to health issues.   He works over and beyond, and it clearly is his passion.   Sue Pullen steered me to some one to help me buy this gorgeous home.....and I went to her to find someone to sell this gorgeous home.        Tony Ray Baker and his team are amazing, and Sue Pullen.......is as well\nupdate....\nMy house was on the market ONE DAY and I have a solid offer.      AMAZING Tony Ray Baker (and team)!!"}
{"input": "Fantastic gyro.   I got mine customized with baba ganoush.  Paid extra but worth every penny.   Nice big chunks of meat.   A welcome change from traditional thinly sliced.   This is the place to be at 2am for sure"}
{"input": "This hotel is a hidden gem in the desert! Clean rooms, cozy ambience and excellent customer service. Free cookies, free breakfast and free use of the business center. Highly recommend"}
{"input": "A gem of a find when were tired of the same old restaurants in the area. We never heard of this place before. They have a nice selection of gluten free options. The pizza was very good. When ordering the pasta, you get salad and a huge basket of rolls (plain or garlic). The pomodoro has a little kick but all in all everything was delicious and I highly recommend this place."}
{"input": "Solid cheesesteaks.  Cheese fries are also good.  Not worth venturing far for, I'd say you can get similar in most of Philly."}
{"input": "Costco does it for me. They fill every one of my sensory and retail needs. Yes, I'm a big fan.\n\nI can kill an entire afternoon at Costco and not even realize that I've missed appointments, gatherings, meetings and conference calls. As per the usual at a lot of these member's only box clubs, they offer tons of samples and of good stuff, too! There was one Saturday that we were sojourning around the warehouse and stumbled across Kobe beef lunchmeat. What?? Yes. Kobe beef lunchmeat *samples*. I couldn't believe my palate. \n\nAt this location, I haven't encountered anything but polite, helpful employees that are usually eager to please. I love how they know exactly where to direct me regardless of what department they're stationed in. The only exception I've run into is the older lady who works in the cell phone/electronics area. She doesn't seem to be grateful for employment anytime I go there, but her comrades in the rest of the store more than make up for it.\n\nKeep Costco-ing, Costco -- you're the master of it!"}
{"input": "This brewery was phenomenal and our Rock N Rolla beer we drank was perfect. Crazy it was brewed in house. The environment of the brewery is so much fun, especially when the garage doors are open. Great food, great atmosphere, and even better service by the servers. Live music too."}
{"input": "I ordered a caramel macchiato and absolutely loved it. This was way better than Starbucks coffee. I liked their wrinkle fries, their sandwich was good and flavorful, and owner was very friendly. My husband and I both ordered a panini. I only wish I would find a menu online somewhere. They are a little hidden gem, so they should do their best to reach more people."}
{"input": "We are visiting in Philadelphia from California.  My son took us here for our 28 year wedding anniversary. All the food was delicious and the service was great! Everyone that worked there seemed happy to be there and we're extremely friendly! The pita bread was baked to order and served directly from the oven to the table and was by far, the best I'd had. The hummus, tabbouleh and marinated veggies were all Amazing! The grilled mixed mushrooms and lamb sausage were so flavorful! We didn't have anything that wasn't delicious! If I ever come back to Philly,  I would definitely go back to this place! SO GOOD!!"}
{"input": "OH MY GOD!\nI started off dinner with the Crab Bisque which was amazing! It actually had big pieces of crap in it, something that you usually don't get because many restaurants are cheap when it comes to seafood. I had the Gourmet Cheesesteak sandwich and I think after all the cheesesteak sandwiches I've had in Philly this is by far the best! The sandwich is a mixture of sliced rib eye (very good) and their filet mignon angus beef. They top it with vidalia onions and Cooper American cheese, i seriously dont think anything else will top this. My wife ended up having the Filet Mignon and that was great also. She mentioned, \"oh man i forgot to ask for steak sauce\" but as soon as she cut into it the steak was so juicy she said it didn't even need any sauce. Also I really recommend the BubbleGum drink, it was a great mixture of alcohols and it was surprisingly very good."}
{"input": "Sometimes this food is very very good.  Unfortunately it's not consistent.   Ordered something I've been getting for years and every other time it tastes incredible. It's like they have different people in the kitchen and you don't know who you will get. So 50 % of the time it's excellent.  UGH."}
{"input": "Erin left, then she came back briefly, then she left again. Which is how I ended up with Ellen. Just as good, super cute, and really knows her hair. She will not let you leave with anything that's not fabulous (she's definitely a perfectionist). My haircuts were bumped up to $45, but still really reasonable for the quality I receive. Anyone looking for a new stylist should go here!"}
{"input": "Worthless. They turn off the WiFi on Sundays!  Now I have a drink and can't get any work done."}
{"input": "Creative food and good. We get coffee or tea while we wait to be seated and even that is a cut above.  We love their Bloody Marys too.  Always interesting and an adventure."}
{"input": "We stopped here for a late lunch and absolutely loved it! \nThe wife ordered the \"big fried fish\" sandwich and I went for the crab cake sandwich. We both choose the southern green beans and fries. \nOmg the food was delicious, and plenty of it! The crab cake was perfect and tasted really fresh, and the fried fish not too greasy - which can often be the case. They also have a homemade tartar sauce which was awesome! \n\nWe can't recommend this place enough,  service, food, everything was spot on. We'll definitely be back here for dinner sometime soon!"}
{"input": "Didn't know that this was Blake Sheldon's place. We here for a private party.  The place was beautiful. Love the flow of the chair set up, bar, and stage. Place was also clean and their food was delicious. We had biscuits, mash potatoes, fried chicken, pull pork, Mac and cheese, Brussels Sprouts, and some salad stuff and all were delicious. I love their fried chicken; crispy and crunchy. This place was lively and groovy.  I also loved their live camera and great lighting and sound system."}
{"input": "Excellenet Professional Service ! Loved my experience here today...unfortunately didn't get name of stylist who did my haircut but she was incredibly good !! U earned my confidence"}

{"input": "Good, fresh, clean. Nice folks. Funny soundtrack playing, but despite the 90's pop it feels authentic."}
{"input": "I'm always amazed when I can just roll by this place in my car and gaze longingly in the window.  BUT... most of the time , there's no resisting!!!!  Try the cherry cream cheese donut. Chocolate donut chockfull of white cream. (I should just rub them on my thighs and bypass the whole digestion thing, because that's where they're gonna end up.) Get the picture??  GO..."}
{"input": "I love milk and honey! Big sign right in front. Walking inside to see some great designing. The store build out is very clean and great attention to detail. The menu ranges from brunch items to cold pressed juices. We got the fried chicken biscuit and the mean & green juice. It was really good the biscuit nice and fluffy. Chicken juicy and crispy. The juice was lightly sweet. I would definitely recommend this spot for brunch. \n\nRecommendation: fried chicken biscuit / mean & green cold press juice"}
{"input": "reviewing Sloppy Hoggs is easy.  Food is spectacular and all other BBQ places in YEG are now rated based on Sloppy Hoggs being the baseline standard of excellence.\n\nLooking around at what food items others have ordered as they are sent past our table make me simply want to come back again and again to try something else."}
{"input": "Went into Ashley today, was met by Andre(Powell)  the salesperson when we entered the store he was very courteous and nice.I thought the buying process was gonna be painful but Andre made the process real enjoyable and he was very knowledgeable of all things we asked of him...Keep Up The Great Job!"}
{"input": "Picked up takeout from Village Whiskey (so I can't review the actual restaurant). The Whiskey Burger is pricy ($26) but is amazing if you're ok with a greasier burger. Super tender, the bacon is awesome and it's pretty big. If you can get past the price then highly recommend it. The Duck Fat fries are also rich and delicious."}
{"input": "Great selection and tasty meats! I went here to get a present for my brother and his girlfriend. I was going to get them 6 Filet Mignons and I had a coupon for 12 free burgers with any purchase. I went in and they accepted my coupon even though it was an online coupon and gave me other great deals as well. I walked out with 12 sesame chicken breasts, a beef stew, 6 Filets and 12 burgers all for under $50! Which is well worth the quality of meat you get. My brother was pleasantly surprised!"}
{"input": "Best coffee in philadelphia located in a no-frills cafe. In fact, there isn't even a menu. A small selection of pastries and caffeinated drinks. But definitely come here for the coffee, smooth and well-priced."}
{"input": "Have ordered take out from here twice. This is one of the two best Indian restaurants I've been to in Bucks County (the other being Cafe Bombay in Bristol) -- everything tastes fresh, and you can taste the ingredients (as compared with so many places where the meals basically just have one note). Highly recommend this place."}
{"input": "This place has a few good things going for it: \n\n1. REALLY good gravy fries...seriously, if you haven't had them yet - you haven't lived\n2. The staff here is friendly and entertaining! Don't let it alarm you if a waitress and a member of the kitchen staff randomly have a lover's quarrel...its all part of the character of the place! lol!\n3. It is the perfect bar to watch ANY Philly sports team...but especially the Phillies. \n4. Pretty good beer selection, too!"}
{"input": "Great staff, very accommodating, they will walk you around to assist you finding what you are looking for. Definitely one stop shop."}
{"input": "Super tasty and enormous portions. Some unique flavors too. Not much else to say but an amazing ice cream store that others should try to emulate."}
{"input": "House of Beauty is an absolute sham, and possibly a scam!  I ordered products from them some years ago, and waited a ridiculously long time to receive them.  I decided to try them again recently, ordered my products online more than 6 weeks ago, and have received NOTHING!  No one ever answers their phone, and I have written several emails with no response whatsoever.  DO NOT order anything from these people, they are terrible!\n\nAngela"}
{"input": "Jon Butler was a pleasure to work with in buying a new mattress! Highly recommend going in to see him specifically. The store is clean and easy to navigate w a great selection! Jon made the whole process quick and easy which was important to me. Thank you Jon- I'll be back for sure!"}
{"input": "The variety of ice cream flavors offered here is ridiculous, and no matter which flavor you end up going with, you will not be disappointed. Great place for an afternoon stroll!"}
{"input": "This is some of the rudest, most unprofessional  service I have ever seen. The waitress was in a foul mood as soon as we entered the restaurant. She seemed upset when we didn't order more than pizzas. When she returned with plates for the pizza, she gruffly dropped them on the table. She never offered to refill our drinks, she seemed more concerned with playing with her cell phone. She dumped the bill on our table without saying a word. Do not support a business that mistreat customers this way."}
{"input": "Great local bar! I love the portobello sandwich. It's marinated in balsamic too. So yummy! The Hoppy Ass beer is a great IPA at an unbelievable price. Great place to meet with friends for food and drinks. It is also kid friendly. The also have a chess game if you want to play with your friend while enjoying a cold beer!"}
{"input": "I was walking on Delaware Ave looking for an ATM and a cup of coffee and wandered into the ING Cafe. After tapping my account, I walked around a curving wall and stepped into a very open, lively and orange public space. I had an excellent cup of Peet's, free WiFi, but honestly, the people watching was so good, I got very little real work done. Great spot to crash and get a cup, excellent vibe. So nice, you will wonder if you are really allowed to just walk-in like that."}
{"input": "Bad experience!!  There was a large  loud party in the bar when we arrived.  We were told they would leave in 15 min. but they did not leave for 75 min.  If told the truth, we would not have stayed.  Only choices were to yell at your companion or not communicate.  Chosen wine not available and not offered another selection at the same price.  When we complained to the staff about the service and the noise, we were  made to feel like it was our fault and offered no sympathy or compensation.  The good food was ruined by the abysmal service and the noise."}
{"input": "Delicious! I had the famous cream cheese ice cream topped with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"input": "Get their lavender latte with cocounut milk and an espresso shot. Guaranteed life changer."}

{"input": "Omg! Omg! Omg! What a hidden gem! I'm disappointed I didn't take pics but the food AND service was amazing!! I forgot my servers name but she was very helpful and so attentive as I arrived earlier than the rest of my party (one other person) she kept checking up on me to see if I needed anything. Once my friend arrived the server then explained the menu to us bc it was our first time. She recommended the steak tartar in a jar and we ordered two pastas. The lamb and the seafood. Although they are small portions, we were stuffed. The steak tartar was my favorite, I honestly dream about it, it was that good served with crunchy soft bread. Everything was very on point at this place! Will def visit again soon. And there's a parking lot! A great plus for me bc I hate driving around looking for parking"}
{"input": "I'm in the Clearwater area quite often for business so I'm always looking for good restaurants. Cafe Ponte was a recommendation from the customer who was joining us for dinner and it did not disappoint. The lobster bisque was excellent with just a hint of habanero. Something unique that I was not expecting. I had the Boullibaisse which was loaded with seafood in a rich broth. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town."}
{"input": "On a recent trip to TN for a \"best friends\" reunion we decided, pretty spontaneously, to get matching tattoos celebrating our 15 year friendship! We didn't have any expectations about being able to get into a tattoo parlour especially one with the reputation of Black 13! However, Black 13 even though fully booked, went out of their way to accommodate us knowing 3 of us had to return to CT! In addition to cleanliness, the staff was VERY polite and Ryan did EXACTLY what we wanted! I would highly recommend Black 13 and I definitely plan to return next time I'm in the area!!!!!!!!!"}
{"input": "Best Indian I have ever had! The food was fresh and delicious. Staff are very friendly and attentive and restaurant is clean and welcoming. The paleek paneer and briyani were amazing!"}
{"input": "This is my kind of store!  A unique, quirky, and cute selection of jewelry, cards, and home furnishings awaits you. \n\nWhen I dropped in, they were having their summer sale: 25% off everything in the store, with the exception of some goodies from local vendors. \n\nStaff was extremely friendly.   Put this on your list and drop in!"}
{"input": "Found this place on yelp and came to try to since it was walking distance from circus circus.  Waitress was friendly and we were seated after a 10 min wait.  We ordered the popcorn chicken and pork cutlet bento.  Both were a little under seasoned for our taste.  The pork was also dry.  The peach tea was delicious."}
{"input": "The raw oysters were good, although I noticed the shells were dirty.  I'm all for freshness but gotdamn can you wash them?  That weirded me out just a little bit.  The bbq shrimp was great, and very filling.  I don't remember what my fiance had, but he ate all of it happily.  The hurricane was too strong.  I guess this could be a positive or a negative.  Our waiter, poor guy, was in charge of way too many tables and service felt slightly slow and inattentive.  They didn't have a ton of options on the menu, but maybe this is the kind of place that just does a few things well.  It definitely beat waiting in line to get into ACME.  Overall, I'm on the fence about this one, even though I really liked my food.  I'll definitely go back next time I'm in Nola and update my review."}
{"input": "super awesome place, bartender chip was the best at the sports bar. very attentive and engaging, had an awesome experience and will come back next weekend for sure!"}
{"input": "Found this place strictly because of Yelp. Fantastic breakfast. I had the hash mountain which truly is a mountain and delicious. My father in-law got the french toast and his exact words were, \"This may be the best french toast I've ever had\". Kids enjoyed their meals. Especially the sausage. Nice big links, not those teeny little \"Johnsonville\" store bought sausages. Service is a bit slow but in my opinion that's part of the ambiance. It feels and taste's like your over at your grandmother's house for breakfast. Why rush it? We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and I'll definitely be back to try the lunch menu. Thanks Yelpers!!!"}
{"input": "This place was worth the wait!  Their lobster pasta was really good !"}
{"input": "We ate here several times mainly because of the excellent Shrimp Ju-Ju appetizer.  In fact, our second night we had 2 orders of the shrimp.  We are grateful to our server, Colin, for recommending them our first night.   As I'm writing this review, I can still picture the shrimp and even better, I can still taste it.    There are a few dishes I dream about and this is one of them.      We also tried the fried calamari; it was good.    I'm from the north where we like marinara sauce with calamari.   In the south it seems to be served with sweeter soy or  sweet chili based sauces which I'm still getting used to.    Our entrees were very good: po-boy and fish of the day.     It's a nice place ambiance wise in a very good location.      I will give a shout-out to Colin for recommending the Shrimp Ju-Ju."}
{"input": "Went to two different party's this week at ole Reds first upstairs private party the food very good service was even better. Everyone had a great time. \nSecond party even bigger our hosts rented the whole restaurant for a private party. Again the food was fabulous service was perfect. \nThe problem was a more personal issue. There was a group of us from Bakersfield enjoying the food and service while listening to the band who were taking requests so I got up with a $20.00 dollar bill in hand and made a request for anything from Merle Haggard . Returned to our table and waited and waited.  It became clear the leader of the band preferred more current song choices not old forgotten Country Music legends. \nBeing from Bakersfield it would have meant a lot to us. The band was good but lack of respect to take a tip and dishonor Country legend all in the same night is shameful. One song any song ??"}
{"input": "I was in the mood for beef. The tenderness and flavor of the meat was excellent. Service was great too. In a city of great food you always have so many choices. I would choose this restaurant again."}
{"input": "After we couldn't get tickets to see Fast & Furious on time, we went to the bar at Logan's to kill some time before catching the next showtime. The restaurant was crowded but we got seated quickly at the bar. We ordered some beers, BBQ chicken wings (Recommended!) and french fries. I ordered a Sanza Margarita as well after seeing it was on the Happy Hour menu (Happy Hours: 3-5 pm and 8-10 pm!). For $4, I had a huge margarita, which was unexpected. The service, however, was lacking. I was sitting right across from the bartender and I had to ask him for napkins, utensils, and another beer. He didn't pay attention to his customers at all. \n\nI recommend coming to the bar when you want to catch a movie. The drinks are good and the happy hour menu is awesome. I've rarely seen any restaurant offer happy hour at 8-10pm. Gotta love it!\n\n\n2013/#41"}
{"input": "Great place for dinner!! Had to wait bc it was the weekend but food was good & gator tail was delish!!! Walking distance from our hotel was great bc there wasnt any parking when we were there it was super busy!"}
{"input": "I just got back into working out and so I was a little worried after reading some reviews that I could actually make it through a class without embarrassing myself. \n\nI messaged Devin on Facebook and he reassured me that I'd be okay, he even offered to cover my first class! That made me feel so much better and not to mention I felt like the trainers already cared before I even gave them my business. \n\nWonderful. Best workout of my life and I will definitely be back for more. Thank you Devin!!!"}
{"input": "This place is great, I've only been here once but I can see myself going again over and over again whenever I'm craving Peruvian food! The price is very reasonable, I ordered the Half chicken (1/4 dark and 1/4 white) which came with two sides (rice, beans, or salad) for $9.99! The chicken was super tasty as well as the dipping sauces. I had one of their ice cream truffles which was the PERFECT top off. 5 stars for reasonable prices and great food."}
{"input": "Our office went today for Friday's happy hour special.  Such a great deal, and it wasn't packed.  Didn't expect it, but the food and drinks on their specials-amazing!  Usually the happy hour offerings wouldn't be. Definitely try the pork sliders and the beignets for dessert.  Really fun time and great atmosphere.\n\nStaff was very friendly too!"}
{"input": "Excellent service, food, and price! If you want easy-going atmosphere like you had when you were a child \nback in the day at grandma's house then this is the place to be!"}
{"input": "Not bad, not bad.  Went there for lunch and liked the variety of spice levels.  Also liked that the lunch buffet did not have too many mediocre things, but rather had a dozen well made dishes in smaller batches.\n\nService was above average and cleanliness is next to excellent."}
{"input": "Got an allen wrench stuck in my tire (how? I do not know). I like to support local businesses so I came to Main Street Tires. Some of the best and fastest service I have received. I was in and out with a fixed tire and spare removed within 15 minutes. It was also extremely affordable compared to what I was expecting. Would highly recommend."}
{"input": "This place lives up to its name. They've served me skunked beer, multiple times.\n\nAnd anyone that thinks D-Franks is cheap needs to leave Center City occasionally."}
{"input": "They have the WORST service advisors! Used to be good before Kelly and her team left. Unfortunately, it's convenient to work if I need oil change before I can make it to another Honda dealer."}
{"input": "OMG!! what a disappointment today was, I have been so excited to see Rembrandt's reopen after a few months of remodel, what I was thinking is that the new owners would want to do more restorations of this Beautiful, Cozy, old Church, maybe try to find more space to add Tables, but NO, I walked into a Modern, Cold, Hospital Coffee Shop, the Charm is gone, so so disappointed and sad, we all love the Charm of Eagle, but it seems to be fading fast, Please People talk to all the other Eagle Shop Owners when your visiting them especially the old Original Buildings to keep Eagle's charm and quaintness and restore these Beautiful Buildings."}
{"input": "My husband and I were looking for a late lunch and wisely decided on 312. We were seated around 2 pm, and the restaurant was pleasantly busy. Our server was friendly and informative with the standard \"it takes 45 mins for a deep dish pizza\" warning. \n\nWe ordered 312s and an order of mozzarella sticks to start. The beer was a little warmer than I like, but the mozzarella sticks were perfection. Crispy and hot with melty, gooey cheese. Yum. \n\nOur pizza was well worth the wait. The deep dish \"Stockyard Patty\" came with a buttery crust, slightly sweet sauce, and a perfect disc of sausage. Our pizza was piping hot and drool-worthy. Definitely reminiscent of Lou Malnati's or Gino's East deep dish pies in Chicago. We will be back for sure!"}
{"input": "Awesome and cheap Vietnamese food from the kitchen in the back. You can call in your order in advance too. Ask for the buy-10-get-1-free card if you're a banh mi Pham-atic *groannnn*.\n\nAlso if for some reason \"Sample every variety of Boone's Farm malt/wine beverage\" is on your bucket list, get your ass here asap."}
{"input": "Love, love, love Puckett's. I go in every Saturday for breakfast and eat every last bite. Fabulous food and a wonderful staff, including Adam my favorite bartender in town."}
{"input": "4.5 stars.  I had to deduct half a star for the service.  We got seated in great time but the waiter ignored us for a good 20 minutes then kept forgetting things we asked for.. like water.\n\nOther than that, we got the eggs benedict, basic breakfast plate with eggs, potato, and toast, and a side of pancakes.  Delish.\n\nOh and the carrot cake with the maple cream cheese icing was also VERY delicious."}
{"input": "Zio's, previously known as Cesarina's is a largo staple. This little bakery/italian bistro is a marvel that must be experienced to be understood.\n\nWhen I tell you that the Sandwiches are the size of your arm, I am not joking. Should you get a Meatball Sub, the Meatballs are the size of Croquet Balls. Juicy and Delicious\n\nZio's has about everything a guy could hope for in an Italian Shop."}
{"input": "My goodness!  This good was amazing. I had the Big Easy which came with eggs your way, bacon, boudin sausage, grits or hash browns, toast or biscuits and pancakes.  :-). Everything was flavorful and the staff was welcoming and friendly. I will be back. :-)"}
{"input": "I remember when this was the place - many moons ago. Now, though the portions are large, the menu is dated. Not a bad place to grab a quick bite, but I'm uncertain whether I'd linger."}
{"input": "Long wait. Disorganized and not very clean. Cuban was okay but not great. Same with pizza."}
{"input": "Their cupcakes are really, really, INSANELY delicious. Both my husband and I agreed they were the best cupcakes we had ever tasted. They use very high quality ingredients like European butter for their butter cream icing and fresh fruits for their compotes. You cannot get any better than that people. I will never eat another supermarket cupcake ever again. You can get classic cupcakes or unique exotic ones. We tasted a pistachio cupcake with honey goat cheese icing that was yummy to the extreme!!!!!  Also, Lily and Nima are wonderful, adorable, professional, and very helpful. We ordered our wedding cake from them and everyone agreed that the cake was unbelievably delicious. I can't wait for the next birthday party because we will definetly use ACW again!!"}
{"input": "Had a date night here and really enjoyed the food. The restaurant is a bit noisy but overall ambiance is cozy. We had the flash friend Brussels sprouts to start which were very tasty! I ordered the Amish chicken which was so tender and juicy even leftover. My only suggestion for the $18 Amish chicken is to add heartier vegetables-- bigger chunks of potatoes, squash, and zucchini."}

{"input": "My husband and I ate here and the food was pretty good! Our waiter was very friendly, yet not too annoying. We tried shrimp for the first time, and yet we still weren't fans of the texture, the sauce it came with was delicious. The dinner rolls were excellent, as well as the salads that came with our entrees. The steaks were delicious, maybe a tad salty but good anyway! The restaurant itself was small, but we had no problem getting a seat right away!"}
{"input": "Love the smells of chocolates here as you walk in the door!  Amazing and creative chocolate team here that can create just about anything out of chocolate, icing, nuts, dried fruit.\n\nWhat we love:  \nGourmet chocolate dipped pretzel rods,\nMint meltaways (dark and milk chocolate )\nChocolate covered orange peels\nBourbon chocolates\n\n\nAlso a great place to find or special order your favorite candies.  \n\nLastly, I've got to mention - the treats they put together for special events and holidays."}
{"input": "Wow!  Probably our 4th time at this place and each experience has been amazing!  Our waiter, Peter, was an incredible guide through all the great menu options. Lamb/Kim Chee potstickers were over the top. Highly recommended!"}
{"input": "Super Fun place that we happened on by chance during our weekend child free get-a-way.  This place made me wish I had brought my kids along.  It is a great family spot with really amazingly good food!  We will be back!"}
{"input": "Short rib tacos ruled! The sweet potato fries were an awesome starter. Our server Lindsay was amazing. Kept our glasses full the whole time and checked up on us constantly! Good vibe and they had the game on which in the playoffs is always a good thing! I'd go back again! Maybe take mom and dad to this joint!"}
{"input": "Needs some attention in the dining room. Good salad  but skimpy on the bread. No sweet tea .  I noticed a booth with children almost be for at least 30 minutes. One was a sleep. Finally an employee came out to them. She must have brought to work with her. I was concerned because they were small & alone."}
{"input": "I love the atmosphere here, and the food is toothsome. All ingredients are incredibly fresh and the dishes are thoughtfully prepared. Their coffee is also excellent."}
{"input": "The service and beer selection were in my top 5 favorites of all time.  The staff were very attentive and helpful. They helped one another. The food was great from the Kobe sliders to the crab-cake.  When in town, this is my favorite place to go."}

{"input": "The team at Greco Rose was amazing! I reached out a little late in the wedding planning game, for a July 4th wedding, nonetheless! I had originally planned to go to a salon, but for about the same amount we were able to stay at home and have a team come to us. Totally worth it. Shanna and Natalie made the trek to South Lake Tahoe despite the holiday craziness and made me and my girls look beautiful. I also have skin allergies, and Shanna came prepared with vegan, all natural products so I didn't have to worry about any reactions. I can't thank you enough for helping me have the wedding of my dreams!"}
{"input": "We were excited about the fun vibe and great music in a laid back atmosphere on Broadway! Bartender was not friendly--yelling at customers and not real accommodating. Had to leave to enjoy our laid back vibe elsewhere."}
{"input": "The Peppermill is the best hotel in Reno. It has great restaurants and good gaming. The pool area is really cool with three pools and two hot tubs. The service here was excellent and management is always right by their co-workers. If your in Reno then Peppermill is where you should stay!!"}
{"input": "I travel quite a bit and let me say amazing customer service! The Happy Hour at Luke's was great, the oysters even better and the service was the best! Two employees in particular were happy to be there and treated all customers great their amazing attitude was contagious - it was great to meet you Jamaal and Roshawn!"}
{"input": "Excellent deep dish pizza! Worth the hassle?...barely. This review for carry out. It's Germantown, so parking is a process of circling a three block radius of where you want to go, till you find a spot. After struggling thru a crowd at the door waiting for tables I had to hunt down someone that worked there. The waitresses seem to be selected for youthful vigor not customer service skills :) About 20 min after arriving I finally got my pizza that I called in more an hour before and headed home."}
{"input": "Staying in the area, Wine Works was a convenient choice from my hotel. The selection of craft beers was BIG, but the prices were a bit steep. We splurged, and had fun making up our own six-pack.  It seems $3.50 for a regular 12 oz is a lot, even if it has a high alcohol content. ;)\n\nThe wines were divided up in a few different ways, smart marketing on their part. There were sections based on price, based on specials, on \"velvety\" versus \"bold\" and of course by region. There is also a tasting area that apparently requires you having a member card. The membership is probably a good idea as it's free and offered some good discounts."}
{"input": "Great fair service.   Shop local\n\nHave used them 2 times now and I really like the attention to detail that the owner gives to the work."}
{"input": "Calories and diabetes be damned - fewer things could be better than gelati on days as brutally hot as the ones we've had this week.  Thanks for helping to cool us all down w your frozen treats.  Five stars for you.\n\nPS - visit the website for a little Vanilla Ice."}
{"input": "I was here a few times because my friends won free happy hours. When I won one, I sent in my guest list and tried to call them a few times to confirm. Neither of the people who answered the phone were friendly or helpful, and I never did get in touch with the woman in charge of happy hours. She never returned my emails or phone calls. When I showed up with my friends, they didn't have my name on the list and forgot that they even offered me a happy hour. It was irritating, and after some fighting, they eventually let me through.\n\nThere is a dress code (no sneakers, flip flops, hats, etc.), but I don't really mind. The bouncers and bartenders aren't very friendly and can be slow, and I never tried the food. The crowd isn't great either - attractive and douchey (maybe because, like us, they're just trying to get drunk and go somewhere else). \n\nFree booze is always good, but I wouldn't come here for any other reason."}
{"input": "Dealing with this dealership was a pleasure - from the sales staff member I worked with (Sean Morris) through the sales leadership and ownership.  Sean was attentive to my needs and personal direction.  All dealership employees always helped resolve issues to resolution in a professional manner.  I would purchase from Pacifico again in the future!"}
{"input": "Our first time here and it was excellent.  Very fresh ingredients and flavorful.  We had two different soups, chicken satay and pad Thai with amazing mango sticky rice for dessert.  We look forward to many return trips here."}
{"input": "They are really great with making cakes last minute, as I can attest to! I've had a sampling of most of their cakes, and they're all delicious. A little too sweet for my personal preference, but that's not a bad flaw to have!"}
{"input": "Food was amazing (huge portions!), decor is nice, large restaurant and service is fast and friendly. We had the chicken and waffles, chicken and biscuit with  gravy, lemon ricotta pancakes and meatballs. Everything was delicious, and for brunch the entree comes with a complimentary mimosa. Awesome stuff. Will be coming back."}
{"input": "Don't know what it is but If my tummy's feeling icky, I can count on Chipotle's stake to fix me up. I just have to remember not to go during full on lunch time. I usually go between 2 & 4 when it's peaceful and calm. Busy or not the service is always friendly and fast!"}
{"input": "Decent, consistent food. If you're in the CBD, they make solid food for a quick lunch or happy hour."}
{"input": "My wife and I have been coming here with our son for the last few Saturdays. It has become our absolute favorite breakfast spot, we even occasionally meet up with friends and family here. \n\nSo far we have tried 3 different varieties of the crepes and they are Ridiculously Delicious. Most if the crepe shops I find try to over do the fillings or toppings to mask the lack of flavor in the crepes, Not this place. Perfect balance of everything without being too much.\n\nMy wife has tried a couple sandwiches, and they have all been awesome.\n\nThe smoothies are killer, and made with locally sourced ingredients. \n\nThe owner has even come out and sat with us, she is super accommodating and personable.\n\nThe only downside to The Station is the lack of advertising! If there was a bigger sign we would have found this place sooner lol."}
{"input": "If you want beignets in Metarie, for my money Morning call is better than this shop.  If you're dead set on Cafe Du Monde, you're only twenty minutes including parking to Decatur."}
{"input": "Paola is wonderful! Attention to detail & very knowledgeable! The boutique is super cute & very professional. Be sure to call in advance & set up an appointment - she tends to be booked always! She's worth it!"}
{"input": "Ok so I was just admiring how eclectic this place is.  I've never stayed at a place anything like it. No particular theme just a very different peculiar type of hotel.  It's kinda \"trippy\" to be honest but I like that... a change from the hiltons and Marriotts that I have come to prefer. But then we lose power . Come on... after a long day of work just wanted to chill and read a book or magazine until I dozed off to sleep.  I valet parked, Clorox wiped all the door handles and toilet and was just starting to spray the mattress then there went the power! I get it, it's no fault of the hotel, the place across the street lost power as well, but I'm still very annoyed. Of course couldn't get through to the front desk. when I checked out in the morning there was no apology for the inconvenience or anything. I am disappointed and I'll probably stay at a Hilton brand next time I'm in the area."}
{"input": "Usually decent place to shop but the employee was so rude today for no reason. Totally unacceptable considering how much I spend there."}
{"input": "There aren't too many spas advertising a couples' massage.  This was a good choice, if not the least expensive.  Small spa, elegant atmosphere.\n\nThey offer Swedish massage (\"but any pressure you want\").  Free parking is included.  They'll complete your experience with (a glass of) champagne and (one piece of) chocolate."}
{"input": "This is hands down the WORST nail salon I have ever been to. It's highly overpriced and my manicure was awful. They filed off my gels instead of scraping, but they weren't careful and they also filed off my skin. I had three bloody fingers on each hand. My nails were uneven-some really thick, some thin, some with bubbles. The gel started peeling off after less than a week. I should have read the reviews before I went!! You are better off doing your nails yourself."}
{"input": "Formally Lexi's, now under new ownership (Sienna Casino) - Beautiful river view restaurant.  We arrived for a semi late Sunday dinner after some gambling at the Casino- Very dead, only one other group there. They left about 10 min later after we arrived, so we had the entire restaurant to ourselves.  \n\nWe both ordered from the price fix menu: ribeye steak (11oz) with salad & dessert.  Accompanied by a bottle of Markham merlot.  Service was perfect along with the food.\n\nWe'll be back"}
{"input": "Great food Truck!\n\nBurrito:\nis to die for! The burrito is packed with flavor and filling. You get a piece of fish every bite you get. The spice level is just right and it leaves so full but still wanting for more.\n\nTacos: \nare alright. Nice flavors but nothing too special. Most of the time the avocados aren't very ripe so you don't really get any flavor from it. \n\nKatsu: \nis pretty good. I love the sauce they drizzle the chicken and rice with. I just wish they would put a little bit more sauce on it. I sorta wish there was more going on because it is essentially breaded chicken with rice and a salad. \n\nGave 5 stars because the fish burrito is that good. It is the only thing I need from this truck. It is just so good."}
{"input": "They are closed for one month holiday for the family.\nThe whole experience the food, friendlinessp more."}
{"input": "Went to this place with some friends last Saturday. It was our first time. We had a great night. $10 cover. Not sure if thats normal or if it was some special night.  First floor was \"deep house music.\"  There was a dance floor on the second floor but it was too crowded and the third floor was way too hot, so we spent most of the night on the first floor. The dj did a great job and the atmosphere was fun and upbeat. Good space for dancing, although it got a bit crowded towards the end. Drinks were cheap. This is not a \"classy\" place so if your looking for that go somewhere else. But if you like to dance an have an old fashioned good time, give it a shot. We did, and we had fun. I'll be going back."}
{"input": "Great time here. Younger crowd but the musicians are awesome and the vibe is amazing."}
{"input": "Sat outside for an early dinner before the Kentucky Derby. We had the chicken, ribs and macaroni, and the Brie and crab hand pie. All of it was great, the meat was all tasty and tender. The macaroni was very cheesy and had a hint of black pepper. The hand pie, which is new to the menu, was my personal favorite. You could taste the crab and it came surrounded by a well complimented creamy cocktail sauce. Highly suggest everything we had!"}
{"input": "The manager Nester did a great job of assisting with Vegan needs.  Excellent place with great customer service!!"}
{"input": "I loved this hotel! It was a little more than I wanted to spend, but so worth it. Convenient location, bar right down stairs, and I split the cost with some friends.  The rooms were awesome! Wifi wasn't free which I think is ridiculous for how much I paid and being 2014!! Valet parking is available too"}
{"input": "great food, great view. Try the lobster mac and cheese"}
{"input": "Excellent place., stopped by accidentally and found food awesome. Love the food and quality., sure will stop by again."}
{"input": "Quality ingredients. \n\nFirst off, BK Carne Asada and Hotdogs is home of the best Sonoran hotdog in Tucson. \n\nThe only reason there is a so called rivalry between BK and the other guy (gueros) is because of the Travel Channel's Food Wars and they happen to be across the street from each other on 12th ave. \n\nUnfortunately not everyone has the ability to pick up on the difference that fresh and quality ingredients make in any meal... Yes even a hotdog. \n\nFor the reviews that say that BK is okay or alright in comparison to the other guys, I'm sorry but it must be out of tradition, support, loyalty, or simply different sets of slightly untrained taste buds. \n\nBK is the place to go."}
{"input": "Super nice club, much larger than I anticipated. The staff was quite nice when showing me around. I ended up choosing to go with another gym and didn't give a fifth star for the sheer fact of that its very pricey, there's no way I'd be using so much in there as to rationalize the cost. However, if you're into specialty sports training in wide open areas, this place seemed pretty great."}
{"input": "I stopped in to order take out and get a drink while I waited since it was happy hour. I am usually a beer drinker but I decided to step out of my comfort zone and ordered the dragonberry iced tea which was refreshing but not obnoxiously cocktail-ly, very pleasant. I had lemongrass chicken and crab rangoon, the lemon grass chicken and rice was fantastic. I do wish the crab rangoon had a little more filling but the dipping sauce was great. I've been here a few times and I have never been disappointed in the food or the service."}
{"input": "Moved here from Baltimore last November and have had a hard time finding a good hairdresser.  Tried two other salons with disastrous results.  After reading the reviews on Yelp I decided to try Co. Capelli.  Jana happened to have an opening on the next Saturday, and knowing none of the stylists, I decided to give her a try.  She was great!  My haircut is one of the best ever.  She took time upfront to understand the style I was looking for and the type of hair I have and didn't rush through the cut.  She even gave me some styling tips that have my hair looking better than ever.  Thank you Jana!  i will be back soon."}
{"input": "Good goooooood.\n\nEverything we had was just wonderful for Nashville. Parking was not a problem (of course I drive the world's smallest car) service very friendly and helpful.\n\nAppetizers of Tom Kai and Spring Rolls were excellent some of the best I have ever had. Main course of Pad Thai and Curry dishes were equally great!\n\nThis is a fun Nashville institution, Ben Fold's Five recently posted a photo here. \n\nThe nice mix of patrons and great food make me smile as well!"}
{"input": "Great vibe and super friendly service. BEST cafe-au-lait I've had in a while."}
{"input": "Consistently a good spot for lunch, whether pickup or ordering in.  Solid food, quick to make it, can order through Yelp directly.  Labeling of food for pickup sometimes off slightly, but that's a slight problem that can usually get solved easily at time of pickup."}
{"input": "I love the soup salad and breadsticks and sometimes when you go on certain days you may have to wait a while to be seated but the food is hot and delivered in a fair amount of time and the staff is friendly. I especially love the chicken and gnocchi soup so freaking good. Will definitely be back."}
{"input": "We brought our Schnoodle, Chewie, there yesterday for his salon session. It was our first time there with him and I wish I brought him there sooner. When I picked him up, he was a happy pup. He was so so soft and fluffy that I could not believe it. He smelled wonderful. He has crate anxiety and most groomers like to put the pups in the crate. But I found a happy dog playing with other pups and toys."}
{"input": "I got late take-out from Chiang Mai.  It's nice to have a good Thai restaurant in Broad Ripple.  The Pad Thai is good, and their portions are nice.  They do not screw around when you order \"Extra-hot\", which is great.  The crab rangoon (my vice) is good too.  The folks are very nice.  The only thing keeping me from giving them a 5-star rating is that my order was take-out.  I am confident they will get 5 stars when I actually dine in."}
{"input": "We ordered the rib dinner, pork on a bun, Mac n cheese, baked beans, and cole slaw.  Mac n cheese is worthwhile to prostitute yourself out for! The meat on the ribs had great flavor but was as tender as the bottom of my nikes.  Pulled pork had a sweet taste and was overall very good.  Baked beans were okay, cole slaw was very creamy and I would not gets those again (they have an after taste like lake water). The overall experience of getting BBQ in an abandoned car wash is special, worth a try!"}
{"input": "This review is for their lunch menu as I have not tried their other offerings yet. If you are lucky enough to have lunch there during their 11-2 sandwich times, you are in for a real treat! The two sandwiches I have tried (the grinder and the southwesterner) were absolutely delicious! There wasn't a single taste bud that wasn't satisfied. It is pricey and sandwiches are a little on the small side but it is well worth it. \n\nCan't wait to try (afford) their steaks!!\n\nFood: 5/5\nService: 5/5\nPrice: 4/5 - A little high but great quality"}
{"input": "OMG the Mediterranean chicken quesadillas what awesome sauce. Definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys fresh Greek food"}
{"input": "This is great place for mani/pedi. You really  feel like family when you go in. Relax with a glass of wine, spa music and great technicians. The owner, Mila remember your name and visits all  the guests."}
{"input": "The selection is pretty good. The prices are outrageous as one would expect. What I wasn't expecting was to see vegan jerky right at the entrance. How is that even possible? Better yet, why would this place even try to sell that crap? \n\nThey also have quite a few different fish options, which also seems weird. Salmon and swordfish are good soft. Why dehydrate them?\n\nMy biggest gripe is they don't offer samples. I get that jerky is expensive, but they'd probably make it more enticing to buy if they let you try it."}
{"input": "Didn't get to see it because it was too expensive... We were a little upset... Never been to a cemetery that cost money to see (France, England, Italy, USA)... Not a 1-star review because understand why there may be a small fee... Not $20!!!"}
{"input": "This place is delish.  The restaurant is clean and tranquil with food that is yummy and flavorful but not greasy.  The servers are genuinely very nice, although if it gets crowded they can be somewhat harried.  Still, it's a great staple in Santa Barbara that I try to hit every time I am up for the weekend.\n\nSome fav dishes: Tom Yum Soup w/ lemongrass and chicken (all white meat that is cooked properly and tender).\nDrunken Noodles with beef.\nAnd any of the seafood dishes."}
{"input": "This was our Third time Staying at the Historic Streetcar Inn, Our third time was for the 3 day Mardi Gras Celebration 7-10. We are Generally Pleased staying here, With  the Exception of the rude Staff member Glinda,(Not the good witch either) i had two interactions with Glinda both times she was rude and curt when asking Questions over the Phone and confirming reservations..and about the very late reservation charges for our room that should of been charged to my card that should of been taken out thirty days later, but not until the mid Part of January 2016 ?!?!?  Lazy Co-worker Patrick just a sitting blob,not helpful when guest needed help getting in the front door, Patrick just sits on front porch chair watching guest struggling to get keys to the front door out of pocket.. Sitting is what Patrick does best.\nJessica Checked us out, she was Professional and friendly.. We will stay here Again. It is conveniently located and next too the St.Charles Trolley"}
{"input": "Not impressed at all. Sandwich bar was closed so I ordered a burrito. It was reheated in the microwave, cost 8 bucks, and nasty. Some sort of cream of chicken and old cheese on top. I'm amazed they can sell this and call it food. Could have had better at taco bell."}
{"input": "A nice alternative to Cafe du Monde, the beignets were as good if not better. But the real kicker was NO line! \n\nIt was a calm little oasis on Bourbon St. Granted at 8:30 am the street is empty besides garbage men & street washers.\n\nWe were there early on a holiday, so we didn't get to experience any live music, sadly.\n\nWe did have a full breakfast as well, sharing a crawfish omelet & Cajun hashbrowns. Neither was anything to write home about, but really when your name has Beignet in it, does the other stuff really matter?"}
{"input": "Dr. Harris is very caring, compassionate, and knowledgable. I have never once felt like he was ordering tests or prescribing meds to make more money (I feel that a lot of vets are like that unfortunately). The staff is friendly, and I've never had a problem getting an appointment. Highly recommend."}
{"input": "Dranks... Strong! My boyfriend doesn't drink but I'm kind of an alcoholic and I had one of their Texas 16 oz margaritas and I was feeling right... And my bf was legit, eyes glazed over drunk. Their shrimp tacos were ok.. Shrimp was cooked and seasoned well but they literally just throw them on two Flour or corn quesadillas and there you go! Three shrimp tacos. I asked for lettuce on the side to add to it. The guacamole is not fresh but ok... Salsa is thick and chips were decent. Service was good and usually I look for a spot to make stronger margaritas but holy damn... These knocked us both on our ass. Oh... 4 stars bc there were fruit flies and reg flies once the food came out. Otherwise it was legit."}
{"input": "Great service. Fun atmosphere. Delicious biscuits. Got the bananas foster French toast which was surprisingly light. Since got the baked creole eggs and enjoyed it."}
{"input": "I called them after calling another locksmith who was rude to me on the phone. Anyway I called them in the morning and they sent someone out in 20 min. they were done in less than one hour and I received 4 free keys too. their service can't be beat."}
{"input": "What a wonderful surprise to find this gem in downtown Reno.   Food was delicious.  Try the Fried Chicken salad.  Soooo good.  Also had the burger that tasted like it was grilled outside.  Their fries were thin and delicious.  The service was five star.\nThey offered a variety of wonderful dinner fair.  Check out the menu online.  I will definitely go there again."}
{"input": "Pricey ( a ham and cheese croissant was $5.50)  as with anywhere in Santa Barbra but very delicious. Cute space ( a bit hard to find ). The green eggs and ham  breakfast biscuit is to die for.  ($10 I think) The Santa Barbra tri tip sandwich was excellent! Cold brew coffee was good. Lots of good choices in the grab and go section, and our salami and pesto sammy was also great. I'd go back!"}
{"input": "If you can't find something on this menu you like, I would be very surprised.  They have everything from bar food to full dinners and everything in between. We had the chicken quesadilla to start.  It was full of fresh chicken, cheese, onions and peppers. It came with sour cream and salsa on the side. My wife got the chicken marsala, mushrooms and vegetables.  It also came with a fantastic dinner salad. I got the chef salad, which was full of fresh turkey, ham, salami. It also had all the other major salad ingredients.  Everything we had was tasty and well prepared.  Our server was friendly, helpful and had just the timing down for just the right amount of times to check on us. The portions are very fair sized and the prices are right in line with where they should be."}
{"input": "If you come Tarpon Springs and don't have meal at Hellas that's gonna be a helluva good reason to come back to TS!\nWe had a gang of 11 of us that came here for the day away from St Petersburg to chill out and feed our mugs!\nMy fellow Yelpers thank you once again for leading us to the greenest pastures.... as I am now beginning to recite to myself \" as I walk through the valley of hunger I shall fear no starvation for YELP thou art with me Amen! \nWe had to wait about a 1/2 hour to be seated as this place was hopping.\nWe got a table for 11 and were a bit cramped but no one was complaining.... we started of with the flaming Cheese and fried Smelts as the appetizer and they were amazing!\nWe all ordered the different dishes and there were empty plates at the end.  I had the Gyro Sandwich and have yet to taste one as good!\nWe all ambled out of there and ready for a snooze in anticipation of more partying tonight!\nWe will definitely be back!"}
{"input": "I don't get gel nails often, but I can tell when someone takes the time to do a job well and they truly did a wonderful job. Will definitely go back."}
{"input": "This gym inspires me to workout. The gym is so bright and spacious and lots of equipment for all. The Staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable. Best of all they keep this gym clean at all times."}
{"input": "I love this place as it's one of the few with the French bistro feel in the lou. The beignets were hot and fresh but some raw dough in the middle. Don't inhale or you'll choke on the powdered sugar. If ordered a burger with bacon and egg as my dish and we also had lattes which were kind of light for my taste. Maybe too much milk. I enjoy the ambiance here and the fries. Get fries and mussels if you like mussels. Very nice server and accommodated our toddler with the kids proof cup. I'm big on this now. I want to eat out at nice places with my child so being offered a high chair automatically is a new rubric for me on service."}
{"input": "Service wasn't good, wait time wasn't bad but it seemed like our food had been just sitting up in the window because it was so cold. My steak seemed really raw for medium rare. Got no butter with my now tiny rolls. Was really sad paying 40$ for mediocre food. Friends sides came in a styrofoam bowl. Not planning on returning. Sad thing is that it used to be so good. :("}
{"input": "I love this place. Super friendly staff. Great with kids. And the food is amazing. Especially the hash browns. You can also get tomatoes and grits on the side. Yum! And on top of it all it's not hard on the wallet."}
{"input": "My husband and I ate at this restaurant when I was in Nashville for a conference. The thing I like about tapas is that the portions are smaller so you can try more dishes. Our server David was helpful suggesting ones to try and showing us the ones we didn't for next time. Our favorites were the tuna poke,  brussel sprouts and scallops. The mixture of flavors were unique and delicious. The chef has acquired ideas from his studies in both South America and Europe. I look forward to returning to Nashville to try some more of these delicious dishes!"}
{"input": "What a great place for breakfast!! Healthy options that are yummy, other options that LOOK yummy!! We love the atmosphere, service and food."}
{"input": "Went here for lunch on a Friday. I got the fried chicken tenders (hot) with the collard greens and macaroni and cheese. All three were really good! It was more than enough for a meal but could have been split in two. The chicken was juicy and well cooked, but if you like spicy food you will need to add more hot sauce. The sides were also well made. I was interested in trying the bourbon whipped sweet potato but I'm glad I didn't. A friend had ordered it but didn't finish it because she said it wasn't good. I tried a bit of it and completely agreed. Idk if it was the bourbon or lack of seasoning but it just was not good. I usually will make plain sweet potatoes at home, boiled or baked, with a little salt and pepper and they have more flavor then this dish had. Other than that, what I enjoyed my meal. I would be interested in trying other options. It was great for a quick lunch, even with a long line we ordered and got our food pretty quickly. The staff was also really friendly."}
{"input": "My saviour! I have been looking for an affordable, mens barber shop in the area of downtown where I work. Apparently this place has been open for about a year and I should have found it sooner. \n\nIt's an aesthetically pleasing, spacious (two check marks already) barber shop in City Centre Mall. They have TVs embedded in the mirrors facing customers. Nice! I had not seen that before. \n\nMy hair cut was fast, courteous, and inexpensive. I would definitely go back."}
{"input": "A great neighborhood restaurant with what has to be the best pancakes in town! Oh, and the bacon is awesome too!"}
{"input": "I enjoy this place a lot. Went here on a Saturday night with a party of 3 and we were seated right away. They didn't have poori on the menu but the server said she could see if the kitchen would make it for us if we wanted. My whole group was happy with our food and there was plenty left over to take home. After negative experiences at other Indian restaurants, I will keep coming back here to get my fix of yummy paneer."}
{"input": "The place is absolutely beautiful! Nice and clean!!! Staffs are wonderful and nice! They let you try any juice flavor you want. Super refreshing and organic! My all time favors is almond milk,raw honey artichoke& chia coconut.b"}
{"input": "Really liked the interior set up and décor. Tall private booths, with a sports and breakfast food theme, very clean. I got the pancake combo, the eggs were fine, bacon cooked perfectly, hash browns too greasy, but the cakes were super. Light, a little fluffy, and buttery, perfectly prepared. My wife got eggs benedict and said among the price levels places similar to this one, they are the best she has had in Indy. That's saying something because its the only thing she orders for breakfast. Fruit was fresh. Staff was great super friendly and on the ball. Service was quick. The place is really big so we didn't have to wait long to be seated. Prices are what you'd expect."}
{"input": "This place is awesome!  After my basement flooded, I took a few water damaged photo albums to Philadelphia Photographics to see what could be done to salvage them.  They photos couldn't be taken out of the albums, so they scanned them and made prints of each page.  The photos were my parents' wedding and honeymoon albums, so they were very important to me.  I felt like I could trust them to take good care of the albums.  They also did it for a reasonable price compared to other places I went for estimates.  I would highly recommend them for this type of service."}
{"input": "I used to love Pizza Mizza. Something happened the past couple of years. The pizza is a a little thinner, a few less toppings and things like the kids eat for a dollar special is not really a full kids meal nor is is $1.00 ($1.79) I keep going because the service is always great, the location is good, and the half price pizza deal used to be good. Not sure if they are trying to save pennies or there was a change in management."}
{"input": "They offer lunch and dinner combos. Great prices. Food was ok. They play uncensored rap music through out the restaurant. No biggie I like that. Service was a D+. \n\nEthics...\n\nI rated 1 star because I bought a restaurant.com gift card and was not able to use on the lunch combos. They call them \"specials\" (restaurant.com certificate not good towards specials) thus not able to get the \"everyday combos\". After factoring that I had to pay full price vs their combo price, it was pointless to use the gift card. I saved $3 vs the $15 value on the card. (Lost the $3 considering gas cost driving from Brandon in search for a good sushi joint)\n\nDear Sake House, you lost me forever over this combined with poor service. Maybe I'm being too critical but I for sure will never, ever be back. Specials should be specials not every day values on your standard menu. Especially if you are selling restaurant.com gift cards!!!!!!!"}
{"input": "Hankering big time for some all-can-eat sushi, we struck out for Saki Endless Sushi. Saki, a converted UPS Store was tucked away on Gulf to Bay Boulevard. What a delightful surprise. The rolls were beautifully prepared and the fish super fresh. Try the \"Top of the World\" Roll or the \"2 in 1 Crispy\" Roll. Melt in your mouth deliciousness! The Salt and Pepper shrimp was quick fried, hot and oh so good!"}
{"input": "Joyce is awesome! Love that this does not hurt at all. We drive from palm harbor to her place, and it well worth the extra time. Her machine is high tech, and the horror stories my friends told me of their experience ,, makes me love this even more! Love it!"}
{"input": "Been a long time since I've had a local Cuban shop make AUTHENTIC Cubans! This place should have six stars, it's so good! Definitely worth coming to again and again! Really good prices for the quality sandwich they give!"}
{"input": "If you like eating pigs, you will like The Block.  They specialize in pork dishes.  However, I tried a beef brisket sandwich.  It was really, really good.  Smokey, tender, and juicy.  The burger that was also served at my table was significantly overcooked.  It was ordered medium and came out closer to well done.  We ate it anyway.  Everything was good.  The fried pork skin appetizer was a bit too salty.  \n\nOverall, I was impressed, and will be back.  But if I'm spending $11 on a burger, I'm hoping it will be cooked closer to the correct temperature next time."}
{"input": "Wouldn't go here again..... I got my belly button pierced...first off it was pierced crooked, secondly the artist was making really Inappropriate jokes the whole time... Not to mention the fact that he told me about one girl who he pierced who thought the pain was so bad she fainted...Like that's not something you should be talking to customers about as they are about to get their piercing.....NOT COOL! I also hated the fact that he bad mouthed other shops and tried saying that he was the best piercer ever because he's been doing it for this long and blah blah blah.... Sorry buddy but if you were the best my piercing wouldnt have been crooked...wouldn't recommend"}
{"input": "Wonderful customer service from phone agent I wish I could remember her name . Excellent explanation of termite warranty and the services SOS provides. She worked well scheduling an appointment to suit my availability."}
{"input": "I've been coming to the Newtown Saladworks for 4 years.  I like seeing many of the same friendly faces and the best part is that they know my salad order as soon as I get to the counter without even saying it!  \n\nMy coworkers and I often go out to lunch and the one place we haven't been disappointed by is Saladworks!"}
{"input": "This is my happy food! The outside of the building and interior are nothing special, but don't let that throw you off. The food in incredible. I have eaten in and had take out from the steam table. Both are very good, but I agree with Brian R try the Hung ray curry and the disco chicken are not to be missed.\n\nThe staff is very friendly and attentive. The prices are also very reasonable."}
{"input": "We ate here a few days ago and it was good... but not great. Our server was nice and our food came out quickly. I loved the selection of craft sodas they had. We ordered calamari, the Popeye pizza with some added veggies and each had dessert. Our calamari was crispy but not golden brown and not delicious... it was very blonde and greasy, our pizza was ok when it was hot, but the crust was really soggy in the middle and our desserts had to be store bought... my chocolate mousse cake left much to be desired and his key lime pie tasted like sweet custard. No key lime flavor at all. We took the rest of our pizza home to reheat... they soggy crust had become even more soggy and was impossible to eat.... I want to like this place, but don't know if I'll risk wasting my money again."}
{"input": "I drive by Salsa a few times a week, but tonight I decided to stop in to see what it was like.  It's good!  I wish the decor were a little more inviting (hence four stars instead of five.)  They need to do something to make it seem warmer and more comfortable.  The food, though, is excellent.  I'm a vegetarian, and feared there would be little for me to eat there, but I was wrong.   The waiter (Colin) was incredibly charming and kind, and I let him pick a dish for me, and it was great; it was some sort of veggies on top of whipped yuca.  I had flan for desert and it was excellent.  I'll go back."}
{"input": "I recently went to the new  coffee house on Mt Rose Street and I was amazed, delighted, and just down right thrilled to see what a wonderful change they have made to the place. It is actually comforting to walk into the Coffeebar. The decor is wonderful and it very open and airy. The staff is amazing. They all seem to feel excitement about this business and they want to share that excitement with everyone who comes in. I am a Chai fan and so I have tried the Coconut Chai. The aftertaste is like eating a piece of fresh coconut meat. I also tried the Rooibos Chai and it was simply amazing. The flavor was so wonderful that when I was done, I wanted to go back and get another one right then! They have several other Chais, but I loved the Rooibos so much, I am hesitant to try another. But maybe they just get better as I go! Looking forward to another stop at the Coffeebar."}
{"input": "Please note: the coffee is excellent! However, you have to ask for cream and sugar. I find this pretentious and intimidating. It's coffee. I want it how I want it. It shouldn't be such a big deal."}
{"input": "Great Tacos. Cozy atmosphere. They have happy hour and taco Thursdays. Staff are friendly. Affordable. I think\nI'll be a frequent visitor."}
{"input": "Delicious pumpkin pancakes, great fruits and juices, friendly staff, and a cute setting."}
{"input": "Trivia night on Thursdays is pretty rad...if you're into sports and 1980s pop culture...or are just out to consume the widest range of beer in the shortest amount of time in a sort of down-home restaurbar environment. (Think Cheers + Applebees.)\n\nThe real problems with Gullifty's are outside. The porch-deck-bar-thing has a grill, but the menu is limited to beefy delights. Vegetarians and inebriated college students would be sad to discover that sweet potato fries are not served outside. Drunkards would be sad to find that Guinness is not available outside...nor are all of the other wonderful beers that makes Gullifty's inside so awesome. \n\nYou could always have a Coors Light, but only after they run out of Blue Moon on tap...or you could pay $10 for a mediocre organic strawberry cider that you drink 1) to offset its high price and 2) to get drunk enough that you feel good that you just bought organic and that your inner hippy is happy."}
{"input": "Came back again bc I am stuck with a membership... The facilities are nice but they do NOT do a good job. Been coming here for 6 months because of the membership I bought. Every time I have to have them re-vacuum or wipe everything down again. They don't clean out the cup holders or wipe the door kick panels. So frustrating. Some of them on the vacuum side do not seem to speak English so it's even harder to have to explain I need it re-washed :( too bad... The location is perfect for me, if only the quality was"}
{"input": "Nothing more to say than this is the BEST donut place ever. I literally wished they shipped their products. When I moved to Florida, I missed it so much. It's only in New Orleans... sad face!"}
{"input": "This is the best place we have ever ordered sushi from. We refer so many people to this restaurant because we know they are always consistent. The food is always fresh and delicious. The hibachi is also fantastic and fun. Way more than enough food. The scallops are phenomenal too. We have had a lot of different sushi rolls here and all of them are fantastic. You can't wrong. The fried rice is awesome. You can't go to this restaurant without eating the fried rice or you will miss out. Our meals range from $60 on up depending on what you order. The best suggestion I can make if you want to save money is to go during lunch. You can get the lunch box and it has a little bit of everything. The owner is awesome he remembers everyone that comes on. Every time we walk in he makes us feel so welcome and he even remembers if we don't have kids with us or not. I highly recommend this place!!! :)"}
{"input": "I've been geeked up all week about gettin back to New Orleans so I could come to MR. B's bistro!!! When I say the shrimp and grits are the best Ever.... I do mean ever! I killed it!  I truly wanted to lick the bowl! Just greedy! My husband got the filet and loved it as well! Don't come to NOLA and not visit this place!!! The service was great too! We sat at the bar and Larry and Joshua were our bartender/servers!"}
{"input": "This is just my first visit to M3 and we didn't eat only drinks at the bar.  But our bartender was fantastic with us. She made sure to pay attention to us and never let us sit without a full glass even though it was a busy Fri night and was quite busy. I have just moved to the area and happen to be barley a block away. I will be happy to review the food soon, I just got to get my butt in a chair there lol!"}
{"input": "Delicious food. Fast and friendly service! We had the el jaffe, banana short stack, and breakfast enchiladas. Everything was perfection. The pork enchiladas were to die for! So yummy. And my pancakes were divine. Cooked to perfection. Nice and fluffy, golden brown. Next time I'm in Reno this is where we'll go for breakfast or lunch! The owner and the 2 other guys working were just so friendly too."}
{"input": "One word: fabulous! I came to Duck Donuts to get a dozen donuts for my mom's birthday. I had heard about this place through social media and was eager to try it. My family was more than satisfied! There were so many choices to customize your own donuts. If you have a sweet tooth, this should be your go to!"}
{"input": "Excellent food. Simple pizza parlor style menu with awesome alternatives to the Italian pie! \n\nGreat mellow ambiance, super cool indie music on the speakers and super adequate service.\n\nThe flatbread appetizers were amazing, and perfectly proportioned and the salads were gigantic!\n\nGreat beer options as well!\n\nI will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"input": "This is the home of my favorite burger anywhere! The West Coast is a riff on a double double from In-N-Out, but really it is what the double double dreams of becoming when it dies and goes to heaven! I like the Lenox Village location better than the Gulch, but the beer selection and West Coast with tots will keep me coming back for a long time. If you are gonna have 1 burger in Nashville you need to hit this place up. If you are gonna have 2 you need to then go to Gabbys."}
{"input": "The Phillies did an unbelievable job with the new park.  A great place to see a game and I've never had a bad seat.  I currently have the Sunday plan which is a great way to spend a summer afternoon.  (My seats are on the left field side and I've witnessed Philly's change of heart over Pat Burrell - loathing and booing early last year to cheers last last and this season!)\n\nFood choices are great, atmosphere is terrific.  I would rate this the 2nd best ballpark in the U.S.  Sorry, gotta give the nod to AT&T Park  in San Francisco...all the atmosphere of Citizens Bank Park but with the water and the Bay Bridge in the background instead of Packer Ave!"}
{"input": "Don't let the outside fool you-this place is much cuter and nicer inside than you would expect! \n\nFood is good and reasonably  priced. We ordered papaya salad, triple flavor duck, and king tofu soup. Papaya salad is always refreshing, but this place overdoes it on the fish sauce. Anything triple flavor is always a safe but delicious choice. I would say their king soup, with choice of protein, is a winner. \n\nAnd also, BYO!"}
{"input": "Much more than a deli! Wife and I had the Philly and the club. Both were tasty and a good deal. As our total check for four bags of chips (2 kids) and two sandwiches were just over $20. Also, come hungry. It's yuge"}
{"input": "Best nail salon. Only place that puts up with my particularity. Chris always makes sure that my nails look perfect. They also do a great pedicure. Finally found my nail salon since moving up here."}
{"input": "Ok so I lied. There is no falafel here. Went back and got the ziggy burger (eh), crispy chick'n sandwhich (amazing!), quinoa chili (yum), udon salad (eh), and sweet potato fries (pretty good). It's nice to have the option of a vegetarian fast food place because who knows what some of those places put in the mean."}
{"input": "The Loop looks great on paper but living there was just average and overpriced. The worst thing though was dealing with the management, very frustrating! On move in day a bronken blind was reported and still has not been fixed a year later. Ants moved in soon after my son did and they were lucky enough to stay the year too. Management did not respond to emails or to any other efforts to contact them with problems or questions. When my son moved out, leaving the room in tip top condition, we were told the security deposit would be returned within a week. Six weeks later still no deposit. Its nearly impossible to get someone on the phone to help so finally an email told us they sent our deposit to the wrong address! Instead of getting our deposit to us quickly, knowing they made a huge mistake, they claim they could only get us our money in another three to six weeks! The management at The Loop is terrible! Live somewhere else!"}
{"input": "Get the bacon. Get the coffee. Get the pancakes. Get everything. \n(Get your wallet ready too cuz it's not cheap).\nMilktooth fulfills all your hipster brunch dreams - from the tatted chefs to the cool-clothed waiters to the converetrd garage dining area. It seems like a pretty exclusive team. However, once you order and wait (for a bit despite the slow Tuesday afternoon), the taste is so worth it. My table got the berry pancakes, the savory pancakes, and the grilled cheese with truffles. I also got the bacon, which came out in thick fat slices. Its probably the best bacon I ever had. \nThe mango smoothie rivaled a mango lassi, and everything was really delicious. \nuffle oil with aged cheddar grilled cheese. The grill cheese had the perfect savory combo of sweet n salty topped with an egg cooked just right. You can't get more flavorful than this \nI definitely think this is one of those restaurants that everyone should visit!"}
{"input": "The service is super friendly! During my exam, Dr. Dinh was very kind and addressed my concerns. Also, I am very picky when it comes to choosing frames so it was a good thing they had a nice selection to choose from. The receptionist was also very helpful and patient with me during the process haha. Overall experience was great and I will definitely come back for my yearly exam."}

{"input": "I FINALLY got around to trying The Blue Duck Tavern. My friend and I tried the blue duck fries to start with which were great! They were covered in a Gouda sauce (which was very gooda!) and shredded duck meat. For my entree I had the Blue Jawn Burger which was covered in caramelized onion and blue cheese. I thought it was great, but a little overcooked. The onions were cooked perfectly and there was an excellent balance of blue cheese as well! The meat itself was excellent though! My friend had the fried chicken sandwich which she said was very good although it was a little sloppy because the coleslaw kind of got everywhere. I definitely would go back!"}
{"input": "We came here on our bus tour stop on magazine street. The food was really good we had sliders, chicken sandwich (the best) and a sugar donut which was sweet. The atmosphere was nice not too loud or crowded and the music playing was really good. Its a nice place to stop by even just for a quick bite. The staff was also very friendly and helpful."}
{"input": "What a wonderful weekend at the Peppermill. Very helpful & pleasant staff. Including valet, check in, bell person, housekeeping and waiters at the Italian & Buffet restaurants.  \n\nThe most outstanding thing for me were the beds. Yay, they understand it's important to have comfortable beds. The beds, linens, pillows & comforter couldn't have been better, and I've been accused of being a \"The Princess & the Pea\" star! \n\nEverything was perfect. Thanks so much!"}
{"input": "My name is Angela S. and I have a Froyo problem. No, really. I don't even like it that much, yet I continue to go to all of these stupid frozen yogurt joints like some dairy-crazed masochist and eat $4.17 worth of disappointment at a time. \n\nAnd then came Tutti Frutti. \n\nIt's good. It's a little different. The toppings are just so-so, but the yogurt itself is really good. They have interesting flavors, including Taro. If you haven't tried something taro flavored, Tutti Frutti is a good place to start. It doesn't even need toppings. \n\nWith so many froyo places in STL, it's rare that I've visited the same one twice, but Tutti Frutti could become a standby."}
{"input": "Had a grilled chicken sandwich on bun to go. Couldn't hold sandwich due to bottom bun being soggy.  So I decided to just eat the meat.  I saw a piece of hair as I removed the meat. I haven't ate there in years and will not eat there again.  Zero stars from me."}
{"input": "A much better tour than Miller Coors but still too big and way too long. Although it was cool to see some clydesdales up close, I could've done without the 20 minutes in their barn. \nIf you're interesting in brewing beer, I'd say the tour is actually quite informative. Unlike Miller where they mark off how many drinks you've ordered, Busch is a little more lax. Although you're technically only allowed 2 beers each, they don't use tickets or markers so it's quite easy to sneak in a few more samples."}
{"input": "Great birthday cakes...I mean it.\n  BUT: The cupcakes and cookies out front tend to be stale at times...although when I have complained they made good on everything. \n  I will go back!"}
{"input": "Food showed up cold, salmon was raw inside, plastic in the dessert, fatty lamb chops and some sort of stringy thing at the bottom of my wine glass!! The service was great though."}
{"input": "Overpriced mediocre at best. Try bjs around the corner. It's a bit more $ but worth it. Food is better too. This place is like TGIF and on its way out"}
{"input": "Wallet was stolen today at this starbucks.  The workers there were not helpful at all.  They wanted me to \"file a report\" to corporate and would call if it showed up.  Meanwhile someone was having fun with my credit card in cherry hill, new jersey.  And they made it seem like it was my fault that it was stolen, but it was stolen when i was sitting with my items. Not helpful or sympathetic."}
{"input": "Spending the day in Nawlin's ... got hungry and stopped in for a bite.  The wait was extremey long (45 minutes, but everyplace else was also packed), and they passed menus down the waiting line so that you could order the moment you were seated.\n\nPrices were very steep, staff were rude, bathrooms were horrible (tiny single stall), and they rushed us out the moment our last forkfull was on the way to our mouths.  Total times:  45 minute wait, 15 minutes from order to service, 17 minutes until we were clear of the table!\n\nNot a place for good eats, or good service."}
{"input": "Had excellent chive pancake and sweet and sour Thai chicken. Fast delivery to our home. Food had phenomenal taste. Definitely Would get their food again"}
{"input": "Before starting our trip,  boyfriend and I were looking for a spot for dinner near our hotel.  We agreed upon Itty-Bitty for their great reviews.  They are small and filled up quick.  We shared an ordered of breaded mushrooms.  The marinara sauce was divine.  I ordered a mushroom swiss burger with sauteed onions and boyfriend ordered hamburger, both with side of onion rings.  The burgers were so juicy and good.  The onion rings were like crispy onion straws. And were really good dipped in ranch.  The waitress was very nice and personable and it was a great experience.  Prices were very reasonable and was cool to see the Route 66 mural and the license plates from different states.  We may have to stop back before our trip back home."}
{"input": "I was looking for a new salon and this one was recommended to me by a friend. I made an appointment for just a haircut to start. Amanda was my stylist and she was really great. She was knowledgeable, checked in as she worked to make sure I liked it, and very friendly! Overall, I will definitely be returning and probably booking color services as well because I had such a positive experience."}
{"input": "Slum Lords of the worth kind.\n\nDon't expect your security deposit back. If you so much as put a hole in the wall to hang a picture they will charge you for damaging the property. They will lie and say you broke things, and the place was trashed in order to keep your security deposit. They will basically try to get as much money out of you as they can. If you try to pay online that will cost a fee, but they won't tell you, just so they can get more money.\n\nThey also do not upkeep their properties well. Our roof leaked and the air conditioning didn't work. They would not replace it or pay someone properly to fix the roof. They are slum lords of the worth. They will take your money and claim you ruined their place without proper evidence. Do not trust them. I don't care how bad you need a place, they will mistreat you and steal your security deposit. You have been warned!"}
{"input": "It's a dollar to add an extra sauce for the wings, and this is with no warning from the waitress.  Kind if annoying to get the receipt and see that. It was also difficult to flag her down. Still, she was friendly and polite and the order was accurate.\nFood was delicious. We got the wings, potato skins and their famous spinach dip. Everything was cooked to perfection. Generous portions. Food came in about 20 minutes while we drank .\nBeer was tasty and went down easily. I liked the selection.\nHappy hour was nice with a dollar off drafts and half price apps."}
{"input": "This is def on my list of things I miss from Philly.  Cosi was my daily lunch spot for almost two years.  The signiture salad is amazing and their homemade bread is like nothing I've ever had.  I have tried almost everything on the menu and I have no complaints.  Sometimes they skimp on portions.  My first experience here was way back when it was named XOXO...anybody remember that?? The smores are perfect to share with a date or friends.  I always make sure to visit this comforting spot when back in Philly."}
{"input": "Helpful local hardware store. Part of the Ace system. Not having to deal with a mega-store and being able to get personal service are the big perks. They've been very helpful to me even though my projects have entailed inexpensive purchases that involved finding the right screw, bolt and nut."}
{"input": "The family and I ate here on Labor Day, 2015.  We wanted to go to another restaurant, but it was closed, so we stopped at Casa Garcia.  The inside of the restaurant is very pleasant.  The fountain is a nice touch.\n\nThe chips, salsa and bean dip were very good.  We greatly enjoyed them.  We also all agreed that the tortilla soup was excellent.  It was when the entrees arrived that things went down hill.\n\nThe sour cream and guacamole were fresh, but the entrees were just average at best.  The quesadillas had too much cheese and not much else flavor.  \n\nThe meal was not bad, but there are better options close by."}
{"input": "Greatest place on earth?  Yes.  \n\nI love this place.  I love diner food. Every time I go I get the country fried steak breakfast and I am never disappointed.  Very cheap for a ton of food.  And the staff is always super nice.  I really love this place.  It is open all night so it is never a bad time to go.  Everything on their menu is always available.  I love this place so much.  I just got back so now I am going to take a nap..."}
{"input": "The burgers are fresh and delicious. Great sports bar on bourbon st.  I would definitely recommend this place if your looking for a good burger!!!!!"}
{"input": "Great food, great staff, cool atmosphere. The jerk wings are to die for, seriously! Topped it off with the coconut cake dessert for dessert and that too was great! If you don't like spicy, though don't try the wings because they were HOT! \n\nWaiter was really nice especially to my young daughter, her Mac and cheese wasn't bad either."}
{"input": "Unique eatery great food. Good service. Perfect place to stop off and eat when biking! Patio is amazing!"}
{"input": "Went there on a Tuesday with my minivan, which ended up being Senior Discount Day. They didn't tell me before I paid that they won't clean or vacuum 3rd rows on Senior days. I got the Super wash, which included wax. They handed it over with large dirt smudges on the side, like it hadn't been wiped at all. A couple cup holders were barely touched and Some not at all in the front. The rest of the vacuuming wasn't good, with paper scraps still on the floor. I talked with the manager about the 3rd row and why didn't they tell me upfront when I pulled in. He said, \"I won't do your 3rd row on Senior Day. That's the way we've been doing it for 15 years.\" I said I was new to the area and he said, \"That's too bad.\" What kind of customer service is that?!? I usually don't write reviews, but this place was that bad."}
{"input": "Fantastic food. Delightful and amazing service. They always put the customer first! Best shakes this side of the bay! Make sure to try the pork sandwich when on special and the jungle juice shake!"}
{"input": "Didn't care for this place. We shared the big easy breakfast and it was okay. The food was barely warm, and the whole meal was eh except for the pancakes. The pancakes were good, would've tasted better if they were warmer.  The hot chocolate was good, thick chocolate, and it came in a to-go cup which was convenient. The service was also good. We arrived on a Friday morning around 8:15 am and there was no wait, but it was starting to fill up. By the time we left there were a few people waiting outside."}
{"input": "I don't usually give 5 star reviews, but this one is well deserved. I've been coming to Audrey for years and she is hands down the best. Cut, color, style. The best. Like impeccable. She just knows what to do and gets it right every time. I live in Santa Monica and have been to many hair dressers in LA, but no one compares to her. Anyway, just drove to SB to \"get my hair did\" and am SO happy!!! Just had a baby six weeks ago and needed to feel fresh and young again. Now I do :)\nI love you Audrey!!"}
{"input": "We have known Meridith for many years and through several of her restaurant ventures. We recently used her catering service Aneu for a birthday party and couldn't have been more pleased. Her planning and performance were perfect. The two servers she sent were very professional and the food garnered rave reviews from both our guests and from us. Everything from initial planning to final cleanup went without a hitch and her personal attention to detail was perfect. Highly recommended!!!!!!"}
{"input": "Great place to go for non-pizza and burrito cravings.  Hamburger, fries, chicken sandwiches... you want greasy comfort food, they've got it."}
{"input": "nice inexpensive eat. very casual great place to spot for a bite at all hours"}
{"input": "Went on a Saturday around lunch time. Very quiet. I was about the only one there. Sushi was ok. Ordered the eel roll and the Screaming Tuna roll. The eel on the roll was minuscule and the roll was dominated by enormous pieces of cucumber. The tuna roll was better and topped with scallions and masago. The obligatory side of ginger (which I'm not sure is really necessary) was of the kind dyed red, completely unnatural. Ginger is pale yellow or tan colored. Cordial service by the only server but he seemed bored as did the chef behind the counter.  Might try again if I'm in the mood and in the area."}
{"input": "The BEST hotdogs around! No lie! I used to say down town LA or pinks Hotdogs were the best! But nope! \nDaves dogs are BOMB! Plus he has something different on his (secret menu) every week! \nStaff is really nice! I go at least once a week!"}
{"input": "Good value and selection ...... their Pro App makes shopping really easy ...... \n\nLook up anything and will give you the exact location within the store ......."}
{"input": "Soooooo good! Tuesday is the night to go! Selection of 1/2 price tapas and Sangria/margaritas are $5.00. \nWe loved the Fried Manchego, Hot Cauiliflower, and Camarones! \nThis was over the top unique and tasty!!"}
{"input": "The No. 1 gelato in the WORLD? In Philadelphia? You've gotta be kidding me.... \n\nAs someone who has studied abroad in Italy, I was skeptical when my long-lost college friend and her fiance brought me to Capogiro.  But boy am I glad they took me here....I was dead wrong to question this place!\n\nI'm usually a strawberry and chocolate kind of girl, so perusing the selection of flavors I was disappointed not to see a single berry flavor.  But then I caught a sign that said \"Avocado (trust us...)\", and being the avocado lover that I am, asked for a sample.  IT WAS AMAZEBALLS.  Seriously.  I ordered a small cone with Avocado & Nutella (you can never go wrong with nutella anything), and I can hands down say that this was the best gelato I've ever had. Creamy, smooth, and packed with refreshing flavor :)\n\nOnly complaint is that a small cone costs $5....for a poor med student, it's a steep price for some sweet indulgence!"}
{"input": "Food was good, we took advantage of the Sunday Buffet it included fried chicken, greens, smother steak, corn, cabbage.  It was so much more  It was very,very cozy. You would actually think you were eating at your grandmother's house.  This is not a fine dining establishment.  The price was fair, was highly recommended by locals. It's was worth any wait. This place exceeded my expectations."}
{"input": "Hotel is what you would expect from a Hilton Property.  Clean and spacious room with a sleeping and entertainment area.  Breakfast is included with the room as is WIFI. The free WIIFI is slow.  Breakfast is OK, but not memorable. No surprises, good or bad. Hotel staff are friendly, courteous and helpful.  All in all a good value for what I paid."}
{"input": "Always a fun time! We came to see Pete Correale, and he was great! The first comedian to start the night off was not great, but the MC, second comic and the headliner were wonderful! Fast waitress when it came to our food and drinks, all in all a great night!"}
{"input": "We sat in the upstairs piano bar and it was so romantic. White linen tablecloths with candles and a man playing and singing romantic songs on the piano. We did some slow dancing along with some other couples. The food was delicious also! I loved the atmosphere!"}
{"input": "Just went to In Riva for the first time. I had heard they had a dog area and wanted to enjoy the evening with my Benny. The Pizza-n-Puppies area was great. The tables were  a little low (dogs could easily reach if they wanted) but considering I've never seen something like it before, I really liked the concept. \n\nI had the Mushroom and Zucchini pizza and it was alright. The crust was amazing, but I didn't know the pie would have a kick and I truly dislike spicy. Next time I know to tell them no spice and they'll leave it off. I think without the spice the pizza would be great.\n\nUPDATE: I have been to In Riva a few times since writing this original post. Just say don't add spice and the pizza will come out amazing. At least, if you're like me and don't like food spicy.\n\nCheck their Facebook page before heading out on a Tuesday because you need a password for half price pizza."}
{"input": "I've driven by this place many many times, thinking nothing of it. But last night I had a stung craving for pizza. Not just pizza but I wanted the big, thin, NY style pizza. So after reading these yelp reviews I decided to call this am for lunch delivery. \n\nAMAZING. The Alfredo's special is amazing with lots of fresh veggies, along with meat and pepperoni. The large will feed us for many days! And the soup was amazing - the steak and potato - it was ALL steak and potato - so chunky and delicious.\n\nAlso I wanted to say - when I called in for delivery - they couldn't have been NICER on the phone. When I've called in to other places, they usually talk real fast and can't wait to drop you before finishing your order. Not at Alfredos! Great service and delivery was uber fast too! Within 30 mins, I had my meal for the family.\n\nThis is going to be our new dedicated Pizza place for sure! Thanks yelpers for your great reviews!"}

Alden and wife MA are old hands at making and serving ice cream s they have been doing this for 20 some years at heir store in Booth Bay Harbor, Maine. They make their own ice cream, and have created all the flavors."}
{"input": "i enjoyed the pizza and apps, but just thought the service was way too slow.  i felt like i was sitting around waiting for something the whole time i was there.  for a pizza that's supposed to be cooked in around 3 minutes, why the long wait times?  that being said, when the pizza finally did come out, it was pretty tasty, albeit very greasy.  i'm chalking the grease up to the type of pizza i ordered, as the other pizza at the table was delicious."}
{"input": "Great professional tat shop!! My husband and I are very happy with our new ink. Bryan did an outstanding job and I highly recommend him. All the employees were super nice and I can see why this is the city's #1 tattoo shop. Don't forget their new location is 1418 N. Clairborne, in Suite 5, upstairs."}
{"input": "The owners make this place. You tell them to take care of you and they will.  They will pick out the Vino and the food will make your taste buds stand at attention. Sexy and Artistic feel that can \"seal the deal\" on a hot date.  Uber it home."}
{"input": "The spot! Sabrina's is understated and so good. We had the chicken fajita melt as a wrap. The man child had the torta. It's a must if you're in the mid-town Reno area."}
{"input": "So here recently the staff has apparently decided to just close up shop whenever they feel like it regardless of posted business hours, sometimes 7:30, sometimes sooner.  Makes you wonder if the owner or franchisee knows that.   The place improved for awhile and now it appears to be headed down hill again"}
{"input": "The duck was imitation duck not the real thing. The fried rice was good, I was just highly dissatisfied with receiving a pricey fake version of duck."}
{"input": "Excellent food and service. Our waiter suggested the shrimp and grits. So happy he did. The best shrimp and grits I've had. Soup of the day was delicious, and the dessert sampler was really decadent. The new location is great."}
{"input": "I always find something[s] i want in this store. The prices are great and if u sign up for their reward program, you often get coupons in the mail or email.  Don't forget to check the back in the clearance section. Sometimes some of the shoes that are actually on the floor are in the clearance section for some reason meaning that they are 30+% off!"}

{"input": "We went to Red Mesa Cantina 3/26/17 as a party of five. The service was outstanding, our waiter Mario was very helpful, and entertaining. The food and drinks were outstanding. Everyone enjoyed their entrees so much, that no one could pass up on deserts.....which were also delicious.\nWe plan to return for another enjoyable meal in the very near future!"}
{"input": "One of the best places I tried while in NOLA! Came in for dinner and then came in again a couple of days later for happy hour. I would highly recommend taking advantage of happy hour from 3-6 if you want to get some raw or fried oysters! It is a great deal and there are drink specials as well. Also for dessert, try the hummingbird cake!"}
{"input": "By far the best breakfast I have had in a while. Huge pancakes. Simple home fries with not all the extras. The owner is super sweet and really generous. Deffinetly a new favorite."}
{"input": "Great service & nice, large rooms. Everyone was helpful, good for large groups & corporate groups with events - but, construction during the day (new restaurant opening February 2015, week after our stay) and only 1 of 2 elevators worked."}
{"input": "Love the food and love the service, you can't find a better breakfast in the area. This place isn't 5 stars for 1 simple reason, it's soooo LOUD! Please put a few plants or soft surfaces in the dining area so I can at least hear myself think."}
{"input": "I do no ongoing business with PECO as I live in New Jersey.  But recently I attended a conference at their facility and enjoyed it.  PECO opened their lot for all the attendees, although I am not certain what prevented from others using it that day.  \n\nThe staff was friendly and directed the couple hundred of us to where we needed to go.  More staff served us over our six-hour conference.  The facilities were clean and comfortable.  The technology worked perfectly."}
{"input": "I like the atmosphere in the restaurant but the food is terrible.  I was shocked at how bad the pizza was."}
{"input": "this was so worth it.  first, what an awesome innovation - the mini-scoop sampler!  i can never decide what to get, and this time i got to choose FOUR flavors!  i got the chocolate, lavendar honey, coffee butter pecan, and the pumpkin cheesecake.  the butter pecan was in a league of its own, but closely followed by the honey.  not only were these flavorful, but all four were perfectly dense creaminess.  it's a good thing i don't leave near the place."}
{"input": "A great location and beautiful building in the French Quarter.  We enjoyed the red wine - Galatoire's own, and it was reasonably priced.   Everything we ordered was very nice and we had a variety of menu items.  My friends had an oyster appetizer and loved it.  One of our steaks was overlooked but they corrected it quickly. The service was exceptional. Only 2 negatives - they have a dress code and the place was small and extremely noisy!  Overly loud, in fact. (Thus the three stars). We had been hoping for nice, quiet and leisurely dinner.  They pack all the guests towards the back as they are seated, so it looks top heavy on one end of the restaurant."}
{"input": "Best late night snack on Indy's east side. This place has been around forever and has incredible hot Italian subs. I won't go to any other place after 10pm. It's a local, family owned business that has been a communication hub for locals to hang around and \"shoot the breeze.\" Definitely a must try."}
{"input": "My favorite gem  I love this place it's small with only a few tables so sometimes u won't be able to get a seat but that's the only problem other then that it's delicious the best u ever had and the sliders are delicious  plz give them a try"}
{"input": "The Pepermill is one of my favorite places.   The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 is we wanted to go there for Thanksgiving Dinner.  The line was well over 2 hours.  It seems like they could of handled that better.\n\nOtherwise the food is consistently good, prices are reasonable.  The Casino is kept very clean and the food selection is great.  Staff is always friendly."}
{"input": "Average to below average food. Below average wait staff.\n\nStandard food options with some unusual missing choices and some unusual additions. For example, buffalo wings?, meatloaf?  \n\nWait staff inexperienced on basics.  Expect to have to grab forks and extra napkins from neighboring set tables. \n\nOverall a disappointment. Great spot for a restaurant. Poor execution."}
{"input": "Roast beef with mild provolone and broccoli rabe. Perfection!\nOne of many good meals Ive had here over the years. \nGreat beer selection. Nice wines. Meals and libations are reasonably priced. \nIts also a nice place for a woman to dine or grab a beer without feeling uncomfortable. \nTip: Try the Birch Beer. It's really good."}
{"input": "Banana pudding is amazing. You can get the extra toppings but just plain no nana is great. They care about their customers and are always welcoming. I love supporting their shop and hope it's around for years."}
{"input": "The service is not great here.  It takes a long time for our food to come out.  The food is just ok and I have tried many dishes.  The restaurant is way to loud on the weekends and the tables are to close together.  Not a relaxing atmosphere.  It has a great bar scene....crowded and loud."}
{"input": "I really had a wonderful experience at the Nashville location, and we found out that New Orleans had one now and should go to it. Last night we got there kinda late around 10pm. Sat there for 10min and not one person greeted us. Went to the bar to see about service and she informed that the kitchen was behind on completing orders. \nI had to apologize to my friends that we may not get any food after driving three hours down to enjoy the weekend. We did end up leaving the restaurant after 25 min wait for no service or an apology. \n\nI have to say this not what I expected from a big known place for adults to have fun along with kids also. Please do something about this. I hope this is not a reflection of how others could become."}
{"input": "My first visit.  Like the ambiance.  But a long wait for staff to find a missing chair for our table (after they had \"seated\" the four of us.)  Awkward.  Guacamole platter was great, but ceviche (recommended by the server) was terribly bland and non-descript (and mostly cabbage).  The tacos were great, especially the handmade tortillas and the carne asada.  Poblano cilantro rice sounded wonderful but turned out to be very meh.  Calabacitas were awesome until I came upon a huge almost raw clove of garlic, a very bitter and unwelcome addition to the meal.  Really?!  Nothing too exciting on the dessert menu, so passed up that option.  Service was decent, but they really need to pay better attention to keeping the drinks flowing.  Fun ambience, some big hits and misses, and some service issues.  Overall, good but could be much better."}
{"input": "Tacos, burritos. French fries and milk shakes. Where else can you get such combos?? They even have breakfast quesadilla s with bacon in them! This is my go to place whem I'm hunger and don't know where to eat."}
{"input": "Food is awesome; better than you find in most restaurants.  \nThe beer is spot on as well.  My only complaint about the beer is that you can't always get growlers filled if the beer is a limited edition. \nLocation is okay, construction all over the place so parking is limited.\nGreat atmosphere and wait staff."}
{"input": "This place deserves 5 STARS.  It was such a great place to eat at a French style bakery, drink one of the best cups of coffee I've ever had and relax. I would highly recommend this little spot. Great choice. We'll be back!"}
{"input": "Now this is a hometown diner. We went for breakfast and we will be back another time soon for lunch. \n\nA duster restaurant to burg bar & grill, this gem had a ton of breakfast and lunch options with some added Greek flare and a touch of Cuban dishes. To this native Floridian it's the fun options you'd expect to see at a local diner. \n\nI got the mama mias eggs Benedict which included spinach and mushrooms. I selected crispy hash browns as my side and it also came with a banana and strawberry. It was so good I wish there was less hollandaise since it was so good it didn't need that much. \n\nThe guys got the Hungry Greek and an omelet and we were all happy. Choices between potatoes, hash browns and grits ensured there were options for everyone.  A banana and strawberry for everyone too.  \n\nPortions were large, prices good and the choices abundant. \n\nWe had Aly as our waitress and she was great! Friendly and awesome some recommendations. \n\nCheck this place out for sure!"}
{"input": "The loose tea can get expensive, \nbut I love getting ready made teas, pretty wide selection, always something new and they let you mix to make your own concoction, always comes out perfect!\nThe staff are the nicest people around. They remember me when I come in and remember what I like :-)"}
{"input": "This place was on my list for all of the great reviews. The lamb was very flavorful, but the garlic Naan is just frozen from Trader Joe's. Also, the lamb was fairly expensive for the amount you get. Lastly, despite saying they take American Express at the door, the owner would not accept Amex. I will likely not return."}
{"input": "Arrived late, the ramp is dark and very rough. The line guy was friendly but not overly helpful. After getting plane closed up went inside and the other line guy was very friendly and helpful. The facility was clean."}
{"input": "We were there for a group birthday  (as well) and it was wonderful. Our servers were very attentive. No one in our group left hungry. Grab your favorite bottle and enjoy a good meal at this little gem."}
{"input": "Here's a moving tip for you: Don't buy moving boxes. It's an unnecessary expense when so many places will give them to you for free. Produce stands and farmers markets are my favorite places. Just ask nicely, and they'll give you as many as you want. Another plus? They're super sturdy!\n\nAnyway, this review is about Uhaul. I stopped by the grab some bubble wrap and packing tape for my move. The associates were super friendly and helpful, and the prices seemed fair. If you'd rather buy your boxes, they have a nice variety here, with plenty of sizes. And they buy back any unused boxes, which is kind of neat."}
{"input": "Actually make a great cheeseburger for lunch, even though it is traditionally Greek."}
{"input": "We ate at Cava twice over the Labor Day weekend and absolutely loved it. The food was authentic and the staff very friendly and attentive. Can't wait to go back !!"}
{"input": "Get off the phone and serve your customers.  Also throw out the donuts that are clearly rock hard and inedible.\n\n This was my first time in a Dunkin and probably my last if its common for employees to be on the phone obviously talking to a friend while making a vague attempt to take someones order. It was also the worst donut I ever had mostly because it was as hard as a rock. No quality control!"}
{"input": "Best Pizza period. Love the staff and the beer is always cold and the taps are always maintained. If you want fresh beer and a slice it's only 5 bucks."}
{"input": "Great selection of board games past and present! The food is good and the coffee is great"}
{"input": "What a lovely place! Just celebrated my engagement here and everything was perfect! We had the oysters as an appetizer (yummm) then the duck and beef which were delicious as well! We finished off with the bread pudding dessert and they brought us a carrot and ice cream cake for the occasion ! Wonderful end to a wonderful night!"}
{"input": "Nothing feels better than getting validated by a Half Price Books' book buyer.  \"Your taste in books is amazing!\" or \"I haven't seen this title in forever!\"; bibliophile sploosh. \n\nI've been trying to weed down my belongings and eventually tackled my beloved book collection. Half Price Books isn't going to pay you beaucoup credit, but at least your former prized possessions will be passed along to another book lover. And, you get a little scratch in return to buy a few books, used vinyl, or cultural memorabilia. This location is always clean and offers free coffee, the store attendants are friendly, and there is music, video games, movies, paper-goods, and other cool stuff if you are looking for more than books.\n\nThe book-buying process met my expectations, although you should expect longer processing times on the weekends when the masses bring in umpteenth boxes of hardcover James Pattersons/Lee Childs/etc. and inundate the poor book buyers. As a former used bookstore buyer, I feel their pain."}
{"input": "I had chicken BBQ burritos with all kinds of stuff that I like. I love the it ! Good place to sit down with family & had a meal. I wish they had a place for kids to play that would be even better !"}
{"input": "Love this place! Aside from all the sushi rolls, they have a great variety of Japanese dishes as well. The monkey ball is a must try!!! The sushi is really fresh. Honestly, a gem of IV:) they deliver through SBmenus as well so that's a plus"}
{"input": "best place for live music and inexpensive drinks also pool and nice people my husband i  go there at least once a week and often 2 or 3 times a week"}
{"input": "Ok, tried it a couple more times. The Chow Fun was fun chow! Everything we've had has been excellent, except the calamari. \n\nSad because their recipe sounds fantastic, and would be amazing if the calamari was tender. I don't quite understand how they could be so consistently good and yet allow one of their dishes to slip. Do I dare try it again hoping it was a fluke?"}
{"input": "Dr. Poblete is the best doctor that I have ever interacted with. Every visit, we spend the majority of our appointment with her face-to-face. No time waiting in the waiting room. She is careful to help us schedule appointments for our baby when toddlers won't be in the office for her health. She answers the office phone line at any time, takes time to talk with us about any concerns (even if we are being overzealous). Then she calls back later to make sure we are still okay.\n\nShe is very descriptive in all of her explanations and has a wonderful disposition. Everyone's child deserves care like this."}
{"input": "Food looked good.  Nice decor.  Hip crowd, and crowded on a Tuesday - portends good things.  I just thought no room at the bar, no music, just chatter.  Not inviting - so we left.  I'll try it again. But for now, no go."}
{"input": "I just cat say enough about this place they are amazing !!!!! Great work in my extra difficult hair  friendly and possibly the cutest salon ever a must try"}
{"input": "A great meal that my family really enjoyed!  You can tell that the management and the staff here really care about delivering an exceptional dining experience!  Steaks were seasoned perfectly and grilled exactly how we asked.  They have a fun Tuesday night kids theme ($1.99 kids meal with a drink -what a deal!) with a mascot roaming the restaurant, face painting and a ice cream topping bar.  Better get there early to get a table as the crowd waiting as we left tells me the word's out about this great family restaurant!  In a sea of horrific chains Texas Roadhouse in Sicklerville is head and shoulders above the rest!"}
{"input": "Delivery was on time,  but the pizza missed the mark.   A lot.  Really just plain.  No flavor more than bad flavor.   Disappointing."}
{"input": "Celebrating our honeymoon over New Years week, we were lucky enough to score a few nights at the historic Monteleone. I'll forever want to stay there when visiting New Orleans. The decor is lovely, the staff very accommodating (we received an upgrade), and the location is fantastic for exploring the city on foot. The rooftop pool is so awesome with really neat views. Our room had a beautiful and relaxing jacuzzi tub. I can't wait to convince my husband to bring me back!"}
{"input": "Finally made it! The outside is worth stopping for. You can see where they brew their yummy beer as you pull in the parking lot. To the left of the building it looks like there's a place for covered outdoor seating. \nWe went at 5:30 and got seated right away. \nGreat selection of beers! Out table got the Christmas beer, white lager, hard cider and milk chocolate beers. All of which were great! The white lager was excellent! Wish I would have had a second. \nI ordered the burger and potato wedges. This has to be one of the best burgers in the Lou. \nFamilies were there so don't worry about that. Go and enjoy for a family dinner!"}
{"input": "I love Mr. Wizard's because they offer frozen yogurt which is a  lot healthier than frozen custard. I like that they offer some pre-select combinations or you can create your own. The only part that sucks is that there is only outside seating so if it's cold outside, plan to eat in your car."}
{"input": "Well maintained and looks clean. More equipped than the Ina/Shannon location. The personal training area however, is monopolized by some bushmaster. Soon as I stepped foot in there she had to jump in and intervene on my workout. Wouldn't even allow me use of a small portion of the floor away from her client session. I am free to workout in the personal training area at the other location which I miss right now since it is being renovated. Other than the bushmaster, it is a great facility."}
{"input": "Thank you Sooo much Tanja Hutchinson at the front desk...so professional and kind...she really went out her way to make sure I could check in...she deserves a promotion because she was running the front all by herself....Thanks again for your hospitality"}
{"input": "This place is perfect for any meal. The owner is the sweetest and most personable lady you will ever meet and the new Korean additions to the menu are out of this world. If you have the chance to go here please do so."}
{"input": "I wrote a review on Pep Boys about my recent bad experience. They responded on yelp and told me they would like to hear from me and try to resolve this issue. Well guess what? After 4 emails in the last week they haven't  responded at all. They just wanted to look good on yelp by saying we will take care of it. I gave him my email address and phone number. To my surprise no call, no email. They didn't want to rectify anything. Obviously they don't take care of customer and they definitely don't value the customer. What a shame."}
{"input": "I'm picky when it comes to pizza, and Brixx is a win every time! I love that their menu incorporates gluten-free options and perfectly sized lunch options. The wrap around bar also makes it the perfect stop to unwind after work, but arrive early, their patio fills up quickly!"}
{"input": "The only bad thing is that they don't have a good A/C system. The place is very cool, the food is excellent, and the beer is cheap too. I love coming here. Also, if you want a focused, buttoned up server who can answer your every question, don't go here. However, if you want to be served by an authentic, fun a bit spacey hipster, this is the spot!"}
{"input": "This ice cream was deliciously decadent and one of the creamiest I've ever had. So sad they are selling!"}
{"input": "I've had the fortune of eating my way across Asia Pacific, so I might be biased in saying I don't understand the rave reviews. I will say though that the conversation and company I was with more than made up for this!"}
{"input": "We stopped at Mr Wizard's tonight for the first time.  We both wanted something cold and sweet but didn't want to risk standing in line at Ted Drewes.  We were also just a few minutes away.  It was everything we hoped it would be.  Quiet and no lines with excellent concretes.  We had a chocolate chip cookie dough and a Reese's peanut butter cup in chocolate concrete mix.  Yummy!  Cheap too! \nWe will definitely be back!"}
{"input": "Well we went back again for dinner and we were far more pleased. I got the seared tuna which was incredibly tasty. My friends got other types of fish and chicken and waffles. All were really fantastic. We had gotten nachos as an app and each chip was individually dressed as perfect bites. You have to appreciate that kind of detail! Decent portion sizes. Great flavors and service. Even the sodas and beer list had a lot of gems. I would definitely go back again, just not get the eggs benedict at brunch again ;-)"}
{"input": "Outstanding!  The top shelf margarita was perfect and we loved the pork pastor and the red drum. Highly recommend!"}
{"input": "If you want to get in and out quick, this KFC/Taco Bell is \"ok\" for a fast food place.  \n\nI went with my brother early evening, and got two hot wing boxes.  The chicken wings were a little over cooked and overpriced.  I wouldn't say you get a great value for portion sizes.  The hours are not late at this location.  The few times I have been here, the food hasn't so been great either... Overall, customer service is pretty good.  \n\nGo here if you're having a craving for either Taco Bell or KFC. \n\n:) xoxo"}
{"input": "There's not much better than Valentine's. We've been coming for years, but it has been several since we've been. We went last night, and it was as satisfying of an experience as ever before. \nIt would've been my parents' 33rd anniversary, so we ordered a honorary Bloody Mary for my dad's seat. \nBetween the three of us dining, we had two sirloins and a ribeye. Mom and I upgraded our salads to include their housemade bleu cheese dressing. SO worth it. \nEach steak was cooked spot on. Everything was delicious. \nMom got the caramel cheesecake for dessert. Holy cow! That was one of the best desserts I've ever had, hands down. \nThe waitress knew it would've been my parents anniversary, and she brought out two small chocolate desserts that they do in honor of anniversaries. Not only was it delicious, it was the sweetest gesture I've experienced at a restaurant. \nI wish I could give more stars!"}
{"input": "My experience with Shalimar was nothing but wonderful. \nI wanted to get my engagement ring sized and was told over the phone that it could probably be done within the day. \nWhen I brought it by, the team confirmed that the jeweler would be able to accommodate my same-day request and that it would be around $40 (simple band, decrease by three full sizes).\nI checked my size one more time, confirmed, and left to let them do their thing.\nWhen I came to pick up later that afternoon, the ring was too small. It's very important to note that Shalimar sized the ring perfectly, but that I made a mistake and should've gone up a half-size.\nThe Shalimar group were completely understanding and accommodating, even resizing my ring back up and getting it back to me within an hour at no charge! Even though it was my mistake!\nThe associates' attitudes in dealing with what was a pretty embarrassing situation instantly earned my satisfaction and loyalty as a customer. Very grateful for such a wonderful experience."}
{"input": "Service sucks!  We had a party of 12.  We couldn't get enough chips.  We got 1!  I ordered table side guacamole and had to ask for chips.  We couldn't get drinks.  Waitress couldn't keep focused on each person and was very scattered.  Won't be back for the spendy Mexican food."}
{"input": "We ordered pizza for delivery from Elicia's. I've had better St Louis style pizza in Kansas City. The crust was thin and crispy but there was not near enough cheese on the pie. It would likely have been a bit better straight out of the oven but probably not enough for me to go back."}
{"input": "Had a wonderful lunch of fried green tomatoes and vegan barq. Excellent! Nice beer selection and great vibe. Staff was super friendly and attentive. The tunes were easy on the ears. Definitely will go back."}
{"input": "Service in bar can be slow on the weekends so if you are in a rush, ask to sit in the dining room.  Everything gluten free is AMAZING!!! (Especially the BBQ chicken pizza).  The salads are also awesome!"}
{"input": "Bourbon & Branch is the GO TO spot for anything...brunch, lunch, dinner, late night..you name it. The food is SPECTACULAR (especially for my vegans/vegetarians out there), drinks are amazing and the overall atmosphere and service is wonderful. A super chill spot for literally any meal or any occasion. If you're in the neighborhood, gotta check it out!"}
{"input": "We are regulars at Slate, and have been for the 6 years or so they've been open.  This is one of our go to places, and we've never had a bad meal here.  Last night, I had the mixed greens salad, and the mussels, which is the only place in the city that I feel has great mussels.  My husband had the hangar steak, which was done to perfection, and very tender (he gave me a bite).  The drinks are generous, as are the food portions,  Good job Slate!"}
{"input": "This is the best pastry shop I have found in Tucson to date. My father loves the chocolate eclairs, I love the almond croissants and the coffees. My main complaint is how small this place is. So many people go here, because it is really that good!  It would also be awesome if they made french macarons. I am so happy this place is not that far from my home. If you enjoy almond, go for the croissants and bear claws. YUM!"}
{"input": "One of the best restaurants I've been to in a long time. They had dinner\" specials\" that were more than enough for the. The food was EXCELLENT. The service was even better and the chef came out and brought our dessert and introduced himself to us. . Can't wait to go back"}
{"input": "Nice atmosphere & decor, friendly staff but disappointed in the food. We were there on a Thursday night, not particularly busy. We ordered the wings and French onion soup. The wings had an odd taste that I did not enjoy and could not identify. The soup was fine. As entrees, I ordered the braised short ribs, which was not hot when served to me. My husband ordered a hamburger which he found unexceptional, and my daughter ordered the chicken pot pie which was enormous, but mostly filled with creamy sauce and not much discernible meat/vegetables. A bit pricey."}
{"input": "I really like this place, and have had great talks with the owner.  One thing I've found is that the female baristas aren't very friendly to me, and I think I'm a pretty friendly guy.  Today (7/29/11) in particular was a bit annoying: I frequently order iced-tea here, and love that I get a free refill.  I was not aware that there was a charge for a refill on iced-coffee.  The baristas were rude to me and I felt like an imbecile after my interaction.  I'd appreciate the following:  1.) Before pouring me a refill, it would have been nice to let me know it ain't free. 2.) If I express surprise at their being a charge, please don't tell me I don't have to have it.  3.) If I choose to have it because I don't want it to go to waste, please don't tell me \"It's not very good iced coffee\". If it's \"not good\", why the hell should I have to pay for a refill when I don't have to pay for a refill of the iced-tea that is delicious?"}
{"input": "This is our go to spot for happy hour.  Half price margarita pitchers and great food. I love their smoked wings, texas style chili, steak tacos, and turkey BLT.  Actually i've never had a bad meal here.  When in doubt we go to el camino and always end up having a great meal and wondeful time."}
{"input": "I like this place. It's nothing too special in terms of froyo, but it sure does hit the spot."}
{"input": "Stay anywhere but here! They got so little right during our three night stay. Staff not at all helpful during check in when our prepaid rooms had been reassigned to other guests. Maids were the noisiest we've heard in the mornings, playing TV loud with doors open while cleaning, joking around in the hallways in front of doors with Do Not Disturb signs. They actually were whistling loudly up and down the hallway in order to wake the guests!They made up the beds without straightening the bottom sheets. A child could do a better job of making a bed. The elevators smelled, noisy AC units, tiny bathrooms -- we even had to ask for water glasses for our rooms. From what I hear, all this is typical of a Hyatt Place. We won't be staying at one again."}
{"input": "Warning: This location does not accept walk-ins. Signs are posted all over their front door saying \"absolutely no walk-ins\". My brother had a bad experience here getting fingerprints; employees were rude and bothered by having to do this service."}
{"input": "Returned to get a fill and pedicure a week after getting a gel polish change, once I discovered the cost would be over $85 I canceled the pedicure and only wanted a fill. Originally the owner was very nice and attentive but when she sensed I refused to pay their ridiculous price, she turned her attention completely off of me and showed absolutely no regard. She no longer cared for my business and she had no problem showing it. She even reassigned the nail tech to someone else bc I refused to be over charged for service. I asked why the original nail tech was no longer doing my fill, I got no answer. I looked over and saw the owner catering to customers that had just walked in. I sensed flaky business so I ultimately walked out without being serviced. Horrible customer service from the owner. I understand they use quality products but not everyone is looking to spend hundreds of dollars in a nail salon regardless of how \"high end\" it's self proclaimed to be!"}
{"input": "I lived in Mexico for 8 years and so far this restaurant is the most authentic I have been to in Florida!  or many other states! I had the Mole and it was excellent! Just the right amount of spice and the Mole was not over powering as it can be when not prepared correctly! This was only their second day of being unofficially open, I was told the Grand Opening will be in a couple of weeks, and there were lots of people offering help and assistance. Things will calm down a bit later and I would rather have lots of people asking me if I need anything than people ignoring me.\nThe inside is like entering a Art Gallery of Latin Art and even the exterior is a work of art. Best décor I have ever seen outside of Mexico and rivals the top there too!\nIt is a wonderful addition to the downtown St. Pete neighborhood and I am thrilled to see it is moving \"cool\" St. Pete further south!\n I can't wait to try other items on the menu! 5 stars from me!"}
{"input": "I've always loved Wawa.  before any trip or event, I would go to Wawa. They always have what I need. Their food is always fresh and it is made quickly. This Wawa is right around the corner, and it has all of those  qualities. The Gas station can get crowded at times. Thats because the prices,  in my opinion are on the lower side. There is pleanty of space in the parking lot to make it easy to get around.A great feature about this Wawa is the free air!"}
{"input": "Excellent food atmosphere and service . Everything was fresh and hot when we were served ;and the dessert tray is absolutely amazing! \nWe walked here from our hotel ( Hotel Monaco) and are so glad we did! Bon Appetito!!"}
{"input": "I had an our to kill before meeting some friends so I stopped in for a cup of tea and a snack. Unfortunately, they were out of the tea I wanted so I settled for another type. And the spinach-feta pastry that I had was yummy; I wish it could have been toasted rather than heated in the microwave.\n\nThe staff was nice and apologetic about the missing tea. The space indoors is cozy, but the tables are pretty well spaced. The front patio area is spacious...if sitting near Veterans Hwy is your sort of thing.\n\nSo let's discuss why this shop gets 3 not 4 stars. The parking lot SUCKS. Because the space has a drive through, parking spaces are almost non-existent. And all the nearby businesses have threatening signs about parking in their lots with dire consequences promised."}
{"input": "The drinks was strong the food was good I recommend this place I was there yesterday celebrating a friends birthday I will be making another visit sometime this month I get a space of thumbs up"}
{"input": "Today was my first time at Heads and Tails. As soon as I met Jenne, we hit it off and had so many things to talk about within seconds. She did an amazing job on my eyebrows and throughly explained the process and after care product she used. I really appreciated the time she took to check my eyebrows after being waxed and asked my opinion on if I saw anything I wanted fixed.  Already have my next appointment scheduled!"}
{"input": "My fiance and I both visited this restaurant separately a few years ago, and neither of us enjoyed it.  Yesterday, we thought we'd try it again, together.  We walked in the restaurant and were seated at a table by the bar immediately.  There were two people at the bar and two other tables seated.  The host (may have also been our server) asked us what we wanted to drink.  Ten minutes later, the same man came back to our table, told us he had a \"brain fart\" and forgot what we ordered to drink.  We politely gave him our drink order again, and after at least five more minutes, we still hadn't seen him again, and we left.  The bartender, who walked past us at least 3 times, was at the bar on her IPad about 3 feet away from us when we walked out.  We gave them a second chance, and we won't be back.  We each have at least 20 years of restaurant experience, so we understand what service should be, and there are too many other choices to give this place another shot."}
{"input": "One of the last reservations of the night.  Started off w some Florida calamari.  Disappointed, rubbery:(. However our waiter was apologetic and took that off the bill.  I had the Cuban and my wife had the grouper sandwich.  Both where very good.  Pricing was little high on main entries but sandwiches were fairly priced, $$."}
{"input": "Came down here for some of their tasty fish tacos to find out that they have closed this location."}
{"input": "Was pretty impressed,  I had the crab cakes, wife had the quiche and daughter had the shrimp and grits. All was really good, I  was surprised place is so slow on a Saturday,  it has to be because nobody knows they are open, we came over to see dinner menu. Come check it out people ! No Saturday breakfast lines !"}
{"input": "Loved the South Indian items and the Filter coffee :):D"}
{"input": "Nice wines and great location. Too bad they don't have food. But you can bring food up and enjoy the view with your pup so they get big points for being dog friendly! Lovely!"}
{"input": "Our server was very nice.  And, the manager was kind enough to take the chips/dip off our bill because there was a piece of plastic about 2.5\" in the dip.  Other than that, I am sorry to say that the food left a lot to be desired.  The sauce on the wings was not very good.  The batter on the fried pickles tasted like thick cornmeal.  The cheese dip that came with the chips tasted like the pre-packaged stuff you'd get at a carnival.  The mini cheeseburgers were hard and tasteless.  The regular cheeseburger did not have much taste either.  However, the fries and the Coke were good.  We thought this would be a fun place to go but were disappointed to find otherwise.  We are fulltime RVers who have lived or worked in 48 of the 50 states (we'll get to Maine and Conn. next summer to make it 50) so we've experienced the worst and very best of places to eat."}
{"input": "Love the updated seating...so roomy, assigned seats, recliners.  Very comfortable movie going experience.  On our last trip there, however, we witnessed a group of kids stealing candy...a lot of candy, from the counter because it is out in the open, instead of in a case.  We said something to them and they put it back. About 2 minutes later they took it again and walked away.  The \"adult\" with them started cursing at us for telling them not to steal.  The management did nothing except tell us to stop arguing.  Disappointing to say the least since the concessions cost a fortune and my own kids got to witness people stealing and getting away with it while their parents tell them no candy, it's too expensive."}
{"input": "Do not do it unless you just want to drink. We had the hummus platter. It was ok at best. Then for the nachos. Gross. Sent them back and ordered the BTL. Took one bite and asked for our check to get the heck out. We are both just crossing our fingers we don't end up sick."}
{"input": "I wandered into this restaurant yesterday while I had time to kill before a social meeting. I ordered a chicken Caesar salad, and then followed in up with a coffee cake and a cup of joe. It was perfect! Healthful, fresh, perfectly priced, and pleasant people behind the counter. I look forward to going back and getting something more ambitious. In the meantime, I encourage my friends who frequent Doylestown to look into this little gem of a place. Like a fine diamond, it is damned near perfect."}
{"input": "This place continues to deliver excellent food and menu options. It's simple, tastes great, and welcoming environment. We have been coming here for the last 3 years and never had a bad meal. I recently went vegan and the menu has options/ they are will to modify ingredients without any issue. Prices are more than reasonable for the portion and quality. Beer options don't disappoint (even better during happy hour). Here's to keeping it real and local!"}
{"input": "Captn Bill's kitchen is a typical beach bar grub spot. We had the charred oysters, crab cake sandwich and lobster bisque. Oysters good, lobster bisque good but the crab cake sandwich not so good. The potatoes and slaw were the side were bland. Drinks were decent priced. Server was great. Place is a must try if your in a beachie kinda mood for grub"}
{"input": "Best sushi in a long time.  So happy to start the year off with such a great meal!! Lucky to have such good sushi in our town"}
{"input": "Paragon Academy is a Great facility! It has all the equipment you need; machines & free weights and also stationary bikes. It's clean, never overcrowded and the staff is welcoming & courteous. My Personal Trainer and I meet in between kick boxing and Brazilian Jiu jitsu classes and have the opportunity to work out in private. I highly recommend!"}
{"input": "My Office Home away from Office Home lol....Thank goodness I found one because Kmart, Wal-Mart,  Target etc... were all out of needed school folders that schools give you a list for and you have to go on a huge treasure hunt with other frantic parents to find.  Hmmm...you know what I mean.  Worth every penny @$1.49 a folder.  Staff there was cool, stock guy even gave me the folders right off the cart he was unloading from."}
{"input": "great hotel in a very good location. The staff was really friendly, and helped us out a lot. it's a 1-2 minute walk to the bars on Bourbon, 7-8 min walk to Harra's, 10 min walk to Jackson Square. The only downside is parking is $38 a night."}
{"input": "Jazmine has pretty good sushi. Their bar has great drinks. It's probably my 2nd favorite AYCE sushi in Reno.\n\nMy only gripe would be it's a little bit expensive for the quality."}
{"input": "I went back here this year.  The food is even better than I remember!  It really has a lot of history.  Cool place!!"}
{"input": "When a review is only 1 star, then there really isn't too much to write. The service was inattentive, the cheeseburgers were cooked on the surface of the sun (evidently, based on how charred they were), and there was a large roach that crawled across our table after we were served our food.\n\nA note of warning to waiters: you ARE, in fact, responsible to ensure that the food you serve is a reasonable approximation of how it is ordered, especially if it is visibly cooked less or more than requested of you."}
{"input": "This place is just crappy. But in a kind of awesome way. It isn't hipstery divey or anything. It is a great last bar for the night. The prices aren't amazing, but the place is super chill and unassuming. If you are there for more than a half hour, I guarantee that you will meet someone who is at very least interesting to talk to! Sometimes they have live music (usually just one person with a guitar). I very much recommend this place for anyone who doesn't at all care about a bar being \"nice\" or \"clean\" or \"fancy.\" If you do care, I would stay away.\n\nMost of the bartenders are amazingly friendly and rarely if ever have an attitude. They make you feel very comfortable. This is just a great neighborhood bar!"}
{"input": "Great store if you like 50's-Midcentury modern! The prices are a little high compared to my favorite stores in STL, but this store is one of a kind thats for sure!"}
{"input": "This is the place for authentic Indian street food. I've been here multiple times ordering different things ranging from bhel puri, pav bhaji, vada pav, deconstructed samosa and aloo tikki, dabeli, kulfi and more. Everything was made exceptionally well.\n\nI regret not having found this place sooner."}
{"input": "Cute little place!\nThe front desk staff were so nice.\nUnfortunately they were completely full and I wasn't able to get a service there but I will definitely try again when I'm in Boise.\nThumbs up for their customer service! \nThey even suggested and called another spa for me ... highly impressed with that.  I've been in the industry for over 20 years and their customer service went beyond what I expected.  Thank you, I loved your suggestion and they highly recommend you as well!"}
{"input": "I just love to dispel a trend of bad reviews! We stopped in at this Del Taco despite a series of bad reviews and we are glad we did! We wanted to try their fish taco special at two for three bucks. We were not expecting much. First let's discuss the product. The fish fillet was about the size of a wiener cut in two. A little on the smallish size. It was wrapped in two small corn tortillas. Tasted great,not greasy, beer battered. Special price so I bought six for a total of nine bucks, we were stuffed!\n    Let's talk about the wait help, in this case Trent. What a jewel! A tremendous asset to any business! He welcomed us quickly and efficiently! A tittle talkative but in a very good way! The tables were clean,the food served quickly and tasty! Five stars for sure!"}
{"input": "I loved this place, but drove by today to see it was closed for business and there were for sale signs in the windows."}
{"input": "Very clean and Staff were helpful, just what I'd expect from target. \n\nUnfortunately tracvel section wasn't fully stocked and didn't see some shampoo brand I normally buy at other target."}
{"input": "1st time here.  Excellent experience!  Kayla, our server, was terrific!  My husband tried a few different beers to go with his brisket wrap.  He liked them all!  \nI had the grilled cheese w/homemade tomato soup with homemade chips.  Awesome!!!  \nWill come back and try the burgers which they strive for the best!\n\nStaff was friendly & attentive.  Clean facilities.  Better than the average bar."}
{"input": "This was a much needed stop for our group. The day was perfect for outdoor seating so we pulled 2 tables together. We had shrimp po boys the shrimp was great and the bread was so fresh. We had our dog and the waitress brought our dog a cold bowl of water without us even asking. This place has some bad reviews but not from our group of 5. We were all pleased and would recommend"}
{"input": "I absolutely love Dorignac's. Their selection is amazing, and their cafe is delicious! Their alcohol section is very extensive and reasonably priced. They carry beer, wine, and liquor - a one stop shop! In fact, the whole store is priced pretty well. They have a good variety of foods; I eat Paleo a lot, and their Paleo options are good. Dorignac's is a little out of the way for me since I live in Broadmoor, but if I'm in Metairie for errands, I definitely get my groceries here."}

{"input": "Just got a pedi so I can't speak to the massage but my pedi was amazing. Place is clean and very nice, I did not have to wait at all and most importantly they know their stuff."}
{"input": "Great food for the price. \nTender steak and perfectly cooked shrimp. \nWould certainly come back."}
{"input": "Had the specialty BBQ shrimp and they were pretty good but didn't blow me away. Making the mess was fun and the sauce was well worth sopping up with the bread. What really impressed me about this place was the excellent and attentive service I got at the bar."}
{"input": "Updating my review from last nights recent visit. Server Drew was very good, can't complain one bit about the service. Attentive and got everything we needed. Food on other hand was not good at all. My boneless wings were not even lukewarm-cold. Either sat in window for a long time or just not fresh/ not sure. Food took a long time to come out. My sons kids meal mini corn dogs were disgusting. He didn't eat them and I wouldn't either. All you could taste was bad fryer grease as they were also cooked to death. Won't be returning too soon"}
{"input": "You know when you go to place, have an ok meal and then you forget it exists? That is Ants Pants Cafe: forgetable. \n\nI don't know why I forgot Ants Pants the first time. I think I enjoyed my food and the service was fine. I think it was that Ants Pants was merely unexceptional. \n\nToday, a friend suggested Ants Pants. I thought, \"Oh yeah. That place.\" We wandered over from my job and had a very late brunch. I had two eggs and my friend had a salad. Both plates were good, but nothing struck a chord. There should be something you tell your friends with relish or with venom. There should be something that sticks out about a place. The atmosphere at Ants Pants wreaks of BLAH. \n\nI can say that whoever designed Ants Pants is a genius of spatial planning. For a place so small , they smanage to fit 24 seats well enough. But should seating charts spring to mind for where you go for brunch? \n\nNo. Very Blah."}
{"input": "I have been to a couple of Keke's in other cities, however, was exceedingly disappointed with my experience today. After an hour of waiting we were told our order was misplaced and it would be out shortly. I understand these things happen, yet the employees and manager made no attempts to make our experience better. The manager acknowledged once the food was delivered that the portions were small and inaccurate. However, icing on the cake was the waitress dropping off the check as we finally got our first bite. Not to check on us even during the rest our meal. If someone had made a single attempt to make our experience better I would not be writing this review, but today I paid for extremely poor service and I do not plan to return."}
{"input": "Very busy place, with a nice out door waiting area, ordered red sangria and honestly it sucked who puts cinnamon in  sangria and if that's common they put way to much,  basicly it was crap wine with cinnamon in it, on a better not the crab guacamole was amazing, super fresh and a nice amount of crab inside, we also had shrimp/crab  empenada's very good..... I had the carne asada, was cooked very well but sauce was bland as well as the rice, mom had a steak dish that had way to much cumin in it, horrible overwhelming spice that was all you could taste. Atmosphere is nice with the exception of every guy wearing a dry fit shirt and  cargo shorts. Wait staff was professional and quick to serve. I guess I would try it again to get a better experience"}
{"input": "Used Yelp to find a sushi place after a long day of shopping and it landed me at Tako. I have to say that the reviews lived up to the hype. The rolls here are well prepared, very tasty and everything seemed fresh. The private dining rooms are a nice touch, but they are also located next to dining booths so be prepared to look (possibly smell) people's nasty shoes as you need to take them off before entering the room. Definitely worth checking out if you live or are passing by the area."}
{"input": "Service was a bit slow for Saturday lunch but not unacceptable. Understandable as a new place gets its feet under it. I tried to go Friday night and it was a total mess. Long line and nobody taking names. We left. \n\nThe margarita was great. I had the cilantro chicken enchiladas. Also great! The outdoor seating area was very pleasant under the umbrellas on a lovely Saturday afternoon. \n\nOverall, I liked it. They just need a bit more time to figure out the flow. I'm thrilled to see something affordable move into my neighborhood. The prices are very reasonable and this place isn't trying to be \"casual fancy\" like the last two train wrecks that occupied this space.\n\nHope Loco thrives for years to come!"}
{"input": "First time diner and I will definitely be back.  The food was awesome.  Best fried cheese and wings I've had in a while.  Shelby was our server.  She did a great job.  I'm looking forward to coming back next week.  I can't believe on Thursday tall PBR drafts are 2.50."}
{"input": "The food was excellent even the beans and rice taste great. The chicken enchiladas are amazing. The prices aren't bad and the service was good."}
{"input": "I am obsessed with this place! They have great and quick service. Great place for a affordable, good quality and quick bite (carryout service available ). I always get the fish of the day and it never disappoints.  Today the perch was great but my favorite is Mahi mahi. Love this new addition to Callowhill businesses!"}
{"input": "Yelp take notice this is no longer a Holiday Inn Express hotel.\nService is not to par but pricing still is."}
{"input": "On the up side, it's not a chain.  Nice place, well kept.  Staff was friendly.  The sandwich was great!  \n\nOn the down side, mac and cheese premium side was a bit small on the portion and served at room temp.  Drink refills would have been an extra plus.\n\nWorth a stop if you are passing thru."}
{"input": "This is a great quiet place to eat very 1960's business style.  You can have the food of Tony's or eat off the bar menu.  I had the Risotto which was excellent.  Other people at the table had the special, linguine with shrimp and lobster, and strip steak.  Everyone loved their meals.  Of course the service here is fantastic.  They are not overbearing but attentive as well."}
{"input": "Very authentic! Great food, and great salsa bar! I really enjoyed it, and loved the outdoor seating!"}
{"input": "Wawa is the best cheap coffee and food and 24 hours"}
{"input": "I'm very happy with the food, and most of all the service.\n\nI ordered biscuits and gravy and was not happy with what came to the table, the server quickly fixed it and even the manager came out to apologize.\n\nYou can tell everyone cares."}
{"input": "This places never lets me down, I love their cilantro rice and there chicken sandwich is amazing! I add the yellow sauce to everything! If you haven't been, you must try!"}
{"input": "Hubby and I were eager to try this establishment due to a rave review from some close friends. We decided for our date night we would give it a try on Saturday. We pulled up about 8pm and the open sign was turned off. We thought maybe the light was burnt out or someone just forgot to plug it in. So we proceeded to the door. There were people inside and the sign said open till 11pm, so we walked inside. It was like walking into the Twlight Zone, everyone stopped and stared at us. The woman behind the bar came over and told us they were closed. HUH! Ok.... so we left. It was very akward and unpleasant. If they were closed then the door should of been locked or a sign on the door stating private party or something. \nNot sure if we will attempt to try to dine there again."}
{"input": "This is where I head when I get that Texas BBQ itch. The brisket sandwiches are delicious, when cooked properly, and the sangria had me feeling nice. \n\nThe atmosphere is relaxed. Nice bar seating."}
{"input": "Here is a tea review. Yup, a tea review for Bittersweet! \n\nTea tea tea. This is our second time here 5 years apart. Super nice service both times. \n\nNow, he (I assume the owner) brews iced tea over 12 to 16 hours. It is really good, really, really good. You can tell he takes pride in this tea and his establishment.\n\nThis time, I also had a fantastic almond croissant. The white icing is wonderful. Should have bought two the husband took way too much from his \"bite.\" In the past we had cupcakes and also really enjoyed these.\n\nWe will be back on our next NOLA visit for certain."}
{"input": "Hickory Hollow really isn't that bad. If you don't count that shooting earlier this year that is. I'm being serious here. I really don't think the area is all that bad, so I don't know if it is just fear that keeps people from frequenting here or what. It could soon be because of lack of stores, several have closed shop within the last year. \n\nThey have I'd say a 50/50 split in stores like New York & Company to get work clothes and urban stores. As far as I know right now, they still have a Victoria's Secret and Waldenbooks, what more could a dorky girl want in a mall right? Because of the low attendance you'll have no problem finding sales. It's really sad to think this place may be heading in the direction of other malls in the city."}
{"input": "One of my favorite spots for coffee and donuts in NOLA\nParking space available if you're driving.\n\nVery friendly staff. Quick service.\n\nOne caveat- the backyard space is a great addition but they keep the trash close to that area and it smells really really bad.  Otherwise I would have given a 5 star review"}
{"input": "The interior design is impeccable, the staff is friendly and the food is spot on. \n\nIf you want to try something special, more than just your average wings, try the sauce and toss special. You won't be disappointed. \n\nI'll be living nearby and will probably come back to try the other areas of the menu. Well done!"}
{"input": "I come here all the time on lunch breaks. Get the small chopped salad -- it is NOT small and tastes like heaven. Good cocktails too if I'm feeling like a flighty employee :)"}

{"input": "Overpriced mediocrity.  Please don't waste your money here.  My family has eaten here twice and both times \"corporate\" has refunded the price of our meals because it has been so appalling.\n\nThis corporation/restaurant has no clue.  Please don't be ripped off."}
{"input": "The worst customer service and nasty employees EVER!!!  SLOW SERVICE!!!Missing items and cashier not giving correct change.  I felt like she wanted my $10.  Manager was no better...nasty and said to call and complain...she did NOT care. NEVER again!!!!"}
{"input": "I've been looking for a place that served crabs in the Northeast and this is the place! Restaurant area is clean and homey. Crabs were spicy just enough and the beer was cold. Crab fries seasoned perfectly. Servers were friendly and great with offering recommendations. Band was playing and the music complemented the atmosphere. Good size menu and will definitely be back to try other meals here. Neighborhood gem!"}
{"input": "This is a review for pet grooming service. I went out of town and had to have my mom babysit my 3 years old westie, and she decided to shave his head bald because the hair was covering his eyes! I was mortified. He looked balder than a bald eagle (only the top half of his head was shaved and nothing else).... no westie should ever have that type of haircut. I can't ever imagine what would happen if I let her babysit my future kid. So I went online and booked an appointment with Katarina. She is amazing and wonderful in every way! Very friendly and patient. One of the best pet groomers there, I would highly recommend her because not only did she do a great job of trimming... what's left of my dog's facial hair but she also made him look super cute and clean.  I was very pleased with the outcome. Will definitely go back to her for future appointments!!!"}
{"input": "My fiancé and I stopped by for a quick eat before a conference. We let out waiter know this, and he really delivered on the service. We split the shrimp and grits and pancakes for a late breakfast. Not only did our waiter bring the food out quickly, it was split into two separate dishes nicely. And it was the best shrimp and grits we've had! Overall a great experience."}
{"input": "I was so disappointed when this opened; I was hoping for Nashville's first real authentic Greek restaurant (Athens notwithstanding).  This isn't Greek; it isn't even Mediterranean. It's pseudo-Americanized versions of Mediterranean classic cuisine. The corporate chefs got so many things wrong:  Skordalia is a classic Greek dip made out of potatoes and garlic (not bread).  Avgolemono is chicken soup with egg, lemon and rice -- not this thin, awful broth they are currently serving. If one wants true Greek cooking, one should go to Greektown in either Detroit or Toronto. \nJust say no."}
{"input": "Nice atmosphere, good place to have dinner or drinks with a few friends. Vegan pulled 'pork' was not superb but pretty OK"}
{"input": "Never had a bad experience. I always get a dirty chia or a lavender latte, have yet to be disappointed on my drink. When it comes to food, I love having so many pastry options, I love trying different things. Their croissants are buttery and delish. I always look forward to going here."}
{"input": "Go here if you visit STL! We never realized what a huge property the brewery was until we took the beer school tour. It was so much fun and we did learn quite a few tips on pouring and pairing beers with food. They also gave us a little bud light souvenir glass to take home. The museum gives you an insight into how the company came up and how they survived during the prohibition. While you wait for your tour you can grab a bite and beer and roam around the lobby or chill at the Biergarten - an excellent outdoor spot.  On the way out we visited their gift shop and bought a growler filled with any beer of your choice. What sets these growlers apart? They're thermos- so they keep your beer cold for 24 hours! And you get to choose between a black or stainless steel."}
{"input": "I had the best dish I've ever had in New Orleans here, and it was even on a Sunday night.  The BBQ Gulf Shrimp was just absolutely fantastic.  I had a couple of errors with the waiter and the bar, but the food was just great.  The Tuna Two Ways appetizer was highly recommended by my girlfriend and I hardly had a chance to have any, given how good it was (and how she guarded it).\nAgain, the BBQ Gulf Shrimp was simply the best thing I've ever eaten in New Orleans.  I've eaten in a number of places there, but that dish was by far the best dish ever for me there."}
{"input": "An expensive, slightly more refined version of McDonald's breakfasts. Salt content and all. Don't get me wrong - it's tasty (the same way McDonald's is, like \"I totally shouldn't be eating this but my mouth is saying 'yay' so whatever.\" Just not sure it's really any better than typical fast food."}
{"input": "Went this morning to get some chicken and waffles, decided to go first thing when they open. There was a table of 4 and a table of 2, I was a table of 1. There seem to be more people working than dining but yet the service did the disappoint it's slow. After walking pass me several times my server finally stated I will be with you shortly. Another table of 2 came in and shortly after being seated a server came to their table to begin there service. At that point it was time for me to leave. This place have good food, Just hoping one day the initial server to customer contact gets better"}
{"input": "2nd night in Nashville we wanted something a little different and not so touristy honky tonk of broadway. We heard midtown is the spot. This place is like a dive bar you would see in a college town. Everyone is fairly young, well alot younger then broadway. Love how they have karaoke here. The vibe is fun, very laid back. In the battle between Winners and Losers (the bar next door) this place deff wins!"}
{"input": "My girlfriend and I went to Edley's Bar-B-Que Today, 8/28/13, and it was phenomenal! It was a little crowded, but we didn't have to wait five minutes for a table. The restaurant is set up kind of like a high end fast food joint (although the food is MUCH better than your McDonalds.) You go to an order line in the front of the restaurant, place your order, and the food is then delivered to your table. The orders are each designated a number. Ours was 31. \n\nOverall, Edley's was great! the quality of food and service was superb. Not to mention, their bar-b-que sauce was unreal. I would highly recommend Edley's."}
{"input": "i must agree with the reviews.  Hemingway's offers a delightful dining experience. restaurant ambiance is right.  just enough of design, comfort noise level and  service. as mentioned,  the Duck Poutine is fantastic ! we shared the tasty Short Rib Stew,  the excellent Korean Chicken (nashville style), , scratch southern Chicken n Dumplings,  Trumpet Mushroom vegetable combo presented a most, delicious , enjoyable dinner. AND   spectacular cocktails...............  !!!!!!!"}
{"input": "THEY ONLY TAKE CASH!!!  So we took our ice cream addict for a pre dinner treat and picked up a delightful tray of flavors and creams.  I had the raspberry sherbet (*** stars)  it was bland an unsweet but I guess that is my fault for coming to a creamery and ordering sherbet.\n\nOur cream addict devoured five favors for 5 dollars with sprinkles.  She was in ice cream heaven as she drooled the flavors down her lips.  It was delightful watching how much she was enjoying the cold delight.\n\nMy other companion enjoyed the cone and unfortunately had to cover the tab because I wasn't carrying cash.  I guess its not that big of a problem being that its right next to a Chase Banking branch.   But its 2015, who doesn't take credit card these days?!?  Parking is also finicy as many of the the streets are under construction and I don't know how they feel about you parking in the strip mall across the street..."}
{"input": "We had the charbroiled oysters and they were delicious!  This was just the thing we needed to get our quick oyster fix... The sashimi was fresh and the lychee martini was the perfect pair for it!  Definitely and highly suggest this place"}
{"input": "Went for dinner for my birthday weekend. We were late for our reservation because of our Uber, but the hostesses still greeted us with such kindness. We were seated quickly and had a wonderful server. The ambience was very relaxing and intimate. We had the melon, prosciutto, mozzarella appetizer, which was served with Marcona almonds. I ordered the black bucatini and my husband had the scallops. We also had the spicy peanut tart for dessert. Everything was excellent and perfectly seasoned. This will be a regular spot for us!"}
{"input": "My pizza was delicious and quickly delivered! Only reason I give 4 stars is because I asked for them to write a joke on the box and they didn't."}
{"input": "Came in for the beer and a burger lunch venture. When looking at the beer menu, I wanted to try a little of everything. That's when I was suggested the flight. Which is a series of different 4ounce beers brought to the table to sample. Not a bad start. \n\nI then ordered the the butcher burger which had a combination of ground short rib, brisket and chuck. That's when I was sent onto another world of palate satisfying comma. This is the spot for a good variety of beers and good food. Will come again to try other things on the menu. \n\nGreat job guys!"}
{"input": "Excelente comida mediterránea! El gyro es buenísimo y la ensalada griega de las mejores q he comido.  Las porciones son bastantes generosas. Sitio recomendado al 100%  vendré cada vez que pueda"}
{"input": "The hotel is beautifully done. It has a boutique feel and not like just a normal hotel like the Hilton. I had my birthday party there at the restaurant and it was so very nice. The service was wonderful and the rooms are beautiful. The air conditioner was pretty loud in our room but that is my only complaint. It's very close to Printers Alley which is so cool! \nI would definitely stay in this hotel again!"}
{"input": "Great food! The homemade bread on my dlt was delicious. My husband loved his pork burger. Chow chow was a sweet slaw, which was good but a little too sweet for me. Service was outstanding!!! My husband and I split a salad and a beer and they split them both! Atmosphere was nice and relaxing. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"input": "Really nice place to get a pedicure! People are very friendly and it is a relaxing environment. Definitely recommend if you are looking for a clean place to get your toes done!"}
{"input": "Terrible service, food came out cold even after waiting about 1 hour during lunch, way too pricey. Don't waste your time."}
{"input": "Nothing special. Came for brunch and got the big combo which included two eggs, two bacon, two pancakes and home fries. The eggs and bacon were fine but nothing out of the ordinary. The home fries were extremely bland; no amount of salt, pepper or ketchup could make them any better. The pancakes were alright but again- nothing special or worth raving about. The prices were, however, good for the amount of food you get.\n\nService was slow initially. We were seated outside and then it seemed as if the host didn't tell the waitress she had new customers outside, because we waited about 15 minutes for our order to be taken, and it required us asking a waitress walking by if she could take our order. From that point on, the service was good, but it lacked initially. \n\nThe back porch was nice and quiet and overlooks the water."}
{"input": "This is the worst service I have had at a restaurant in Philadelphia. First, they charged myself and the rest of my group a $5 cover, but then proceeded to seat us outside. The server forgot about us and we eventually were able to put our drink orders in. When they came,  we had lower than average margaritas and sangrias. I wouldn't come back here again."}
{"input": "Terrible American Mexican restauraunt. Extremely bland food. Excessively uncomfortable seating.\n\nHad the fish tacos. Got food poisoning. Our chips had hair in it. \n\nI'd rather eat at Taco Bell even if i had to pay the same ridiculous prices they have at Las Tortugas. 2nd worst restaurant I've been to in my life."}
{"input": "My daughter and I went to this litte GEM and it was great.   I had the Catfish Nuggets and it was some of the best I've ever had.   My daughter had a burger ( which I ate half off) and Wow.  It was the best 3.99 burger ever!  Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"input": "They make the best birthday cake HERE, lil pricey but their cake is very very exceptionally good, their bakery is good too, but also a lil pricey, but well worth the extra couple bucks, only downfall to this place is that the people in there don't really speak English, and I have to point at stuff  lol, other than than great place!"}
{"input": "An upscale mexican joint? Really?! I enjoy good authentic mexican food, this is by far the most upscale Ive seen.  Im more of the food trucks and hole in the walls type, so this was different than what Im used to. \n\nThe atmosphere at Besito is tough to beat. They have Merengue & Salsa on the background which doesn't really go with the Mexican theme but who's paying attention. An ideal Date night atmosphere for sure. \n\nFood here is fantastic. A little pricey, but you get your money's worth. You have the ($3) valet outside, great service, waiters have always been friendly and happy to discuss the menu, Besito more than met our expectations. \n\nIf you love Mexican food, and feel like taking it to another level for once, Besito is your place. It's a gourmet mexican restaurant, certainly worth trying."}
{"input": "Short and sweet - Been here three times and haven't been impressed. This last time I called in an order. The guy taking my order was rude and not helpful. I don't know the menu and asked him some questions and he knew about as much as I did. When arriving to pick up. Had to look for service. Was surprised by the 27$ bill for one entree. Got home, missing salad, over cooked steak, over cooked fries. Never again. Hope not everyone has that experience! Good luck. \n\nP.S bring your cash cow. This place is PRICY especially for the quality of food"}
{"input": "I really enjoy this place. Lots of healthy options and I love the blueberry pie!  I always stop in after a day of shopping and haven't been disappointed yet!"}
{"input": "Great great place. Everything in this tiny restaurant was quality..from the friendly service to the amazing food. The staff makes you feel like you're home."}
{"input": "Visited tonight for take-out.  16 bucks for the tutto du Mari, which had 6 small shrimp and a bunch of nasty canned clams, most of which were so mushed up I couldn't tell what they were.  No seasoning except salt and tons of pepper.  Sauce tasted like flour and water.  Salad was limp and soggy.  Bread was ok, but basically a giant unheated roll.  16 bucks for one bite of salad that I spat out, six small shrimp, a bite of bread, and 2 forkfuls of pasta.  The rest went into the trash.  If I hadn't gotten take-out, entire meal would have gone back.\n\nGooey butter cake was ok but not particularly fresh, and t-ravs were edible (but easy to get frozen so hard to mess up).  Hubby had the chicken portobello pasta and reported it bland but inoffensive."}
{"input": "Dave's Dogs is a hot dog stand in a parking lot.  Nothing fancy just delicious hot dogs and a place to sit and enjoy them.   But they are not your usual hot dogs.  They are gourmet hot dogs five to choose from:  Dave's Style, Western Style, SB Style, BBQ Bacon and Pizza Dog.  \n\nI tried the Pizza Dog it was sooooo good.  A wiener topped with pepperoni, pizza sauce, cheese and Parmesan ($5.00).\n\nThe secret ingredients to \"Dave's Dogs\" hot dogs is the quick and friendly service,  cool and calm personality  and it seems great pleasure is taken to making each hot dog a masterpiece. \n\nOverall a great atmosphere for hungry Yelpers, good times and delicious hot dogs."}
{"input": "Great value for Chinese food! Was super happy with General Tso's chicken for $6.75.  I wish this place was closer to me so I could walk-in, but I got it because it was rated highly on Uber eats. Will definitely order again!"}
{"input": "Great burgers, very good value for your money. Family friendly, good service, pretty clean. Will be returning."}
{"input": "Amazing place! Mead was some of the best wine I've ever had! Atmosphere is perfect to get away from the center of convention/conference land...worth the cab ride!"}
{"input": "I love YATS!!!  This was one of my favorite things about living right by Broad Ripple when I was in college.  The food is excellent and freaking cheap.  You may not love everything you can get here, but you will find SOMETHING you love.  I still go here anytime I am in the Indianapolis area.  \n\nUPDATE:  They recently stopped allowing credit cards again.  It's a cash-only joint."}
{"input": "Tried the Brew Bros. Burger challenge as a dare from friends. What are friends for? Though I came close to finishing all 4lbs of burgers, fries, and fixings, I fell short on time. Our server was kind enough to issue me a shirt for attempting and \"coming the closest to finishing.\" Whatever that meant. The food was good, staff was great, and the challenge left me with a stomach ache for 3-days. \n\nI did not get a chance to sample their beer selections but from what my friends said, it's good. I would not recommend the burger challenge if you're going to drink beer. Otherwise for $24, it's by far the best deal on the menu; especially if you split with friends! (splitting the meal violates the rules of the competition)\n\nIf I'm ever in the Reno area again, I will be back to conquer that elusive challenge!"}
{"input": "Beautiful place. Excellent food. I only gave it a 2 because they gouge you on the drinks. My manhattan was $16. A very small glass of house wine was $11.50. There is no justification for that. We eat out often in good restaurants. This is the only place that gouges you on the drinks.\nI got the halibut. It was delicious but quite small with nothing on the side."}
{"input": "Love sitting at this bar. Mezcal Mule is really nice summer drink. I'd recommend the Salsa verde doused chilaquiles with steak/chicken & egg. Fish tacos were great as was the chorizo & steak pizza app. Good prices for high quality"}
{"input": "Locations at both Ina Rd and Oracle Rd have equipment that is out dated and or needs repair.  If in need of repairs the average time to complete the repairs is at least 3-4 weeks."}
{"input": "Soul food done right.  Better than most other places, except for Dunbar's, and the staff is an unusually happy bunch.  If you're vsisting from out of town and want some New Orleans soul, you won't be disappointed.  Good Pralines too, of course."}
{"input": "Amazingly amazing wings and homemade bleu cheese. Had the ribeye: tender, perfectly prepared, delicious. Nice selection of craft beers. Would DEFINITELY recommend checking out this hidden gem."}
{"input": "It seems ridiculously silly, almost petty, to review a chain store like Sephora, but this particular location is so unpredictable that it's worth mentioning.\n\nI have nothing against the products or the product selection, mind you -- Sephora always comes out on top when it comes to their wide selection and fair pricing.  However, the service fluctuates like crazy -- I've had decent service from the salespeople who mind the skincare products at the back, but been absolutely ignored (and when I say ignored, I mean I've been walked away from) at the makeup section of the store.  It's a shame, because I generally have a good idea about what to buy for skincare, but need a ton of help when it comes to makeup.  Maybe they don't like my desperate face?\n\nSadly, the service has been so bad that I've just about resigned myself to their online store or the King of Prussia location, where they're just a shade friendlier and more helpful."}
{"input": "Hate to be harsh but dang! After having a limited selection at terminal F I finally decided to go with Tony Luke's. I was looking forward in trying there Philly Cheese Steak been in Philly and all. So I unraveled the sandwich and to no surprise the sandwich I got didn't look nothing like the picture on the overhead display of the sandwich. The part that got me even more was the meat. I don't know what it taste like to eat dog food, but I am sure I just paid $10 for it."}

A co-worker talked me into trying it out one day (by going there and getting me something and putting it in front of me) and she created a monster. I may not order every day but I sure do think about them. And their delicious salads! Every time I go there I am greeted with a smile and there are tons of other people waiting for their food, as well. Good company =)"}
{"input": "So my favourite Indian in St Louis is still Spice and Grill on Olive, Husband said lets have a change so we tried out Indias Kitchen this evening and ordered a portion of the goat curry.\n\nSorry to say this curry was not great, the sauce was very heavy on the salt and tomato and the goat was tough as an old boot, the naan bread was below mediocre. Only nice thing was the rice.  Very Very dissapointed"}
{"input": "A terrific place to grab a quick bite to eat. Friendly, fast and reasonable prices for the quality they serve up. It the best chick-fl-a I have ever gone to. Most likely because of consistent service of their staff. The manager \"Chris\" is always working his tail off to make sure everything is running as normal. I must say to \"Chris\" thanks for all the support thru the years....you are the best. You have the cleanest, friendliest, all around best restaurant that I know is always there for our family to get a perfect meal...fast!"}
{"input": "I'm pleased to say that I tried the Elm Cafe Catering! \n\nThe sandwiches were amazing and the bread was so fresh. I loved the muffins and can finally understand what all the hype is about. \n\nI had both a BLT and a vegetarian and I found the vegetarian most flavourful and packed with some delicious spice and tasty vegees.\n\nI would definitely order from them again and the table was most pleased with the order too. Can't speak to the coffee as I just had a water."}
{"input": "My friends and I all got one of each that were available to try out. I love the many fun donut flavors they have there. The thing that stood out to me was their fried chicken. I got the chicken sandwich and it was SO GOOD. I highly recommend it."}
{"input": "Good prices. Great food, glad it's part of Trolley. If they stayed open late they would make a killing when the car closed... Just like college towns do !!"}
{"input": "This place was awesome! Even better than I expected! We ordered the Wagyu burger with a side a sweet potato fries and the the filet mignon with a side of asparagus and brussel sprouts. The burger was decently seasoned and had perfect melted cheese on top. The onion jam on top provided the perfect sweet to the burger's salt. The sweet potato fries are skinny fries and are the prettiest, brightest shade of orange I've ever seen! They had a nice texture and good seasoning. \n\nNow, the filet mignon was incredible! It had one of the most amazing textures I've ever experienced in a steak. It also had a very strong pepper flavor that was perfect! The asparagus great and the brussel sprouts with pancetta were everything I want out of life! I will definitely visit this place again!"}
{"input": "Enjoyed traditional bowl... service good... food hot and tasty... Price was reasonable as well... I think I found a new regular lunch spot..."}
{"input": "My friend and I had dinner here on Sunday. I was surprised to be seated next to another party on the same table with just a small partition separating us. This is how some of the tables are if you are a party of 4 or less. The restaurant is small and can get loud. We had very good service. The food was ok, we got the Kale Ceaser and the Fried chicken with mac n cheese. They were out of watermelon so the salad that was supposed to come with the chicken had to be changed to something else. I was impressed with the soft egg that came with Kale ceaser, it was nicely encased in a crispy crust and the yolk was nice and runny."}
{"input": "It's 4am, you're hammered, you're hungry... find one of these carts on Bourbon St. and get a loaded up dog (chili is a must)! Damn good dog! The next morning you'll thank me... or maybe not."}
{"input": "Horrible, old, cigarette smelly (even tho we requested smoke-free); room was never serviced during our 2-night stay, toilet starting leaking the morning we left. Needs a complete, total, expensive remodel!!!"}
{"input": "Love Newk's! First visit. Southwest corner of US19 & Gulf to Bay. Specializing in sandwiches, pizza, soups &salads, all fresh and taken up a notch.\n\nI chose Newk's Q sandwich which is sliced, flame broiled chicken, thick cut bacon and imported Swiss cheese served in a crispy semi-soft sub roll with their signature white BBQ sauce. Very delicious. Then I ordered  a bowl of corn and crab soup. Great flavor and a half Caesar salad which had fresh, crisp lettuce, toasted, seasoned croutons and plenty of Caesar dressing. All very flavorful. All that and an Imported bottle of Italian water for $10. I used one of the $5 off coupons direct mailed to my home. You order at a counter. You're given a number to display on your table and food is brought to you. \n\nManager and personnel very friendly and helpful. Nicely designed interior with an outside patio. Good quality entrees, lots of menu variety. They also have Mac n cheese and a dessert menu from Brownie's to home made cakes. Great format. I'll be back."}
{"input": "I can say this is the best burger of my life!\n\nYou sit outside and Goleta holester Ave is nothing special.   But the burger is the best"}
{"input": "This has to be one of the strangest business decisions ever. Take your very popular B-B-Q joint at the corner of 12th and Porter and move it to a totally out of the way, falling down, probably-soon-to-be-demolished minor league baseball stadium.  WHAT?!?!?  Was this the only space available after Whitt's opened their location at the airport 's C-Concourse? I mean seriously, I was so bummed to hear that they moved here. (If  you can't tell.)\n\nAnyway, the food is generally good. The tamales are bland and gluey. The brisket is highly recommended. The diablo beans should be avoided if you don't have an office with a door that you can close."}
{"input": "The best part about this place was the service. The waitress was so nice. The food was pretty good. Nothing to rave about. I would rather make my own eggo waffles at home. It wasn't bad though! The place is cute and has a nice atmosphere."}
{"input": "I was so disappointed in this meal. First of all the Shakin Bacon Fries had so little bacon that they should really take the word bacon out of the name. Our food was flavorless and when my boyfriend asked why the bbq sauce wasn't cooked in the manager proudly said, \"That's not the Red Hot and Blue way\". He told us how their meat is smoked with nothing on it. So, you get a bunch of flavorless meat on your plate. We both ordered the Five Meat Treat; they gave us plenty of food. Unfortunately it wasn't food that either one of us wanted to eat. The service was fine, just a little slow but our server told us that he was new and he seemed high-school aged; I'm such a sucker for kids who work that I give him a pass. Because the manager knew he wasn't satisfied with the food they took his meal off the check."}
{"input": "This place was a great find. I'd say its a 4.5 but just because of the interior decor. The food was really good, that's a solid 5. We had a vegetable samosa, chicken tikka masala, onion kulcha & lamb rogan josh. Go expecting great indian food but not great decor. We were giggling on the paint job, very easy to tell it wasn't done by a professional. It sits right behind Nifty Fifties so it kind of gets lost & not seen well from Grant Ave but so worth the effort."}
{"input": "Our animals are an extension of our family.  So, we aren't going to take them to any old place for boarding, grooming and medical examinations.  I'm a big fan of the Animal Clinic because they treat the pets as if they were their own pets.  You can't ask for any more.  I would have given them 5* but the location is a little difficult to get out of when leaving."}
{"input": "I'm not sure what changed over the last year at this restaurant, but now it's just terrible food. Before, when I first started coming, it was decent: nothing fancy, but filling and palatable. Now, though, the food is disgusting. 90% of their buffet offerings are WAY too salty. The pulled turkey was tough, the fish tasted like licking a bottle of meat tenderizer, and the vegetables cooked to a putty-like state. The only thing vaguely edible was the corn pudding and mashed potatoes. The desserts are ok, almost store-bought quality. \n\nThe service at least was good. Our waitress refilled our drinks promptly and removed plates often. The only good I saw all night."}
{"input": "Katie's is a neighborhood restaurant that has existed in one form or another for a few generation.  It's classic New Orleans fare with an Italian-American slant.  Great meatballs.  You'll see all types of classic New Orleans old people dinging before 8pm.   You won't be disappointed if your expectations aren't too high."}
{"input": "My first visit and my last. Just spent $21.00 for fried oysters and fries. Fries were the best part of the meal (ketchup was okay). They presented 8 little balls of fried crust covering the smallest, mushy oysters. I eat 3 hoping it would get better but the 4th was mush and foul.\nI told the waiter and he said he was sorry. I paid the bill. Lesson learned but it was not cheap."}
{"input": "The tour bus provided for the OYE: Yelp's Jingle Bus Holiday Lights Tour was perfect for the event. The driver Danny was awesome.  He was friendly, patient, and knowledgeable of Santa Barbara and in the Christmas spirit.  He kept us on track and took us on a great Christmas Lights Tour.    \n\nThis tour was a new experience for me and it was fantastic.  I was impressed with how organized it was.  The bus arrived at Reds Bin 211 on time.   The layout inside the bus was designed for large groups to face one another with a couple of double sets in the back and front of the bus.  The bus was clean and in great condition.  \n\nThey also do other types of tours so if you are planning a bus tour event be sure to check them out."}
{"input": "An oasis at the train station. Very good beer selection, as others have noted. Could be a problem if you weren't planning on having a beer at lunch, cuz you really must. And screw the side salad, though it looks quite good, go for the  awesome fries. For cryin out loud, it's a pub in a train station.  You can go back to the rabbit food when you get home."}
{"input": "It is an actual speakeasy! Very cool and chill place. The ambience is classy but the vibe of the place is casual. Highly recommend if you just want to have good cocktails/drinks with good music. \nWarning: They literally serve one dish of appetizer (which is not that tasty). Don't go empty stomach and with expectation of good food (or any food). As I mentioned, it is true to its speakeasy status."}
{"input": "What a great children's museum! We took six children-ages 1-7. All had something to do and had a blast!"}
{"input": "Parking lot was a bit small and crowded (a good sign).  I was greeted and brought directly to my table immediately (I did make a reservation).  I ordered the Chicken/Filet Tapanyaki with an avocado roll. Salad was a bit too garlicky for my taste.  Soup was hot and tasty (metal spoon and not a traditional spoon).  Avocado Roll was great!\n\nDinner - Good show.  Very personable chef.  Talented.  Fried rice is the norm (no upcharge).  Veggies were hot and still crunchy."}
{"input": "We wanted to pick up some Zima and a male employee was very nice and said they were sold out and Zima is sold out everywhere in town. So he helped us pick out something he said will be similar but turns out grocery stores and Walmart have Zima. Lies. Oh, and P.S. Mr. Man, Truly Lime and Midori tastes nothing like Zima and Midori so thanks for that too."}
{"input": "Waterpark was ok, bathrooms were clean, not a lot of slides but they are expanding in 2017.  We got a cabana which was very expensive but so worth it! Food was ok, but nothing to write home about.  My kids are 13 and 11 and they said they wouldn't go back because it gets really repetitive going down the same slides.  It was very busy and the lines for the slides were long.  If you live within 2 hours of the park, do not stay there over night unless you are dying to get up and go on the slides all over again.  I would suggest doing the afternoon pass, after a few hours, you are ready to go home.  Our server at the cabana was very nice, Rob B."}
{"input": "Love love love The Studio BUT parking has turned into such a headache...unless you get there extremely early and at the right moment (from a previous class letting out) then maybe you can get a spot.  With the new distillery below, the already small parking lot is split...causing for some not so \"woosahhh\" moments trying to get to class.  Case in point, due to 5:00pm traffic for a 5:30pm class and the parking issue, I was 15 minutes late for class and didn't want to be rude to other students or the instructor interrupting class, I missed my class..."}
{"input": "This little gem is bursting with charm and was our favorite breakfast stop in NOLA.  The staff is incredibly friendly, the prices are reasonable and both the beverages and crepes are delicious. Our favorite drink was the Dirtychai. This place is awesome!"}
{"input": "We never got the oysters that we ordered before our entrees. When our entrees came they were far too salty to eat. As former residents of Belgium we were not impressed at all with the food. We were offered dessert to apologize for the oysters but honestly with so many other restaurant options in NOLA we still will not be back.\n\nThe cocktails, however, were good so maybe happy hour would be decent but again, I unfortunately can't comment on the oysters."}
{"input": "Peppermill has done it again with service and accommodations that are second to none.  Gaming at the mill (i only play 1 dollar or 25 cent slots) seems to provide better outcomes and I know reno. Spent a lot here and found the peppermill is the best. Food is some of the best and reasonably priced."}
{"input": "This is sushi for philistines, all sauce and fried things. The spicy tuna is so spicy you won't taste the tuna at all. Flavorful and heavy, like pub food. We got nigiri as a palette cleanser, I don't think there was any vinegar in the rice at all (which is what sushi means). It was good, but not what I expected. Like when you invite a couple friends over for a quiet kickback and it turns into a rager. Fun in an overestimating kind of way."}
{"input": "Just ok. This restaurant was attached to our hotel. \n\nBread pudding was burnt on top and all of the yummy sauce dripped off before it was served.\n\nThe \"bacon onion pizza\" (I cant pronounce the actual name, but we felt \"flamin cootchie\" was a possibility)was supposed to be awesome, but I felt the torte was soggy. \n\nThe beet salad was great. Shrimp étouffée  had a good sauce, but small portion. \n\nAs mentioned in other reviews, expect to spend some time there because the waitstaff is very nice, but slow.\n\nAll in all, there are better places to eat in NOLA."}
{"input": "Service was crappy, and food was mediocre.  I wish I would have picked some other place for my last dinner in town."}
{"input": "This place is in serious need of updates. It's a tired, worn out, and slightly grungy with musty-smelling rooms. I had the executive suite, and no matter how many times I told the front desk that the boardroom table was dirty and that there were crumbs on the chairs (not from me -- from when I checked in), it stayed that way for my entire stay, and I was there for six nights. My colleagues who stayed at the downtown Embassy Suites fared much better, as it's a lot newer and nicer."}
{"input": "Decent movie theater for the area. Nothing really to write home about. I have to admit the wife and I are spoiled from the Archlight theaters in LA, and almost very digital HD theater in SoCal. \n\nThe clientele here on weekend nights can get a little interesting if you know what I mean. Also long lines for tickets so go early."}
{"input": "Seriously I love this theater! You can go on Tuesdays for 1.50 and something like 3.50 on other days. It is the \"cheap theater\". This is where they show you movies that have been out for a while. And WOW. I cannot believe this is the cheap theater. It is so nice! The screens are big, the sound and lighting and chairs and everything is just what it should be: comfortable, clean, and nice. I have been to many cheap theaters in my life and this is by far the best. I just wish it was closer to me! The Oracle cheap theater is closer to me, but by a long shot, this one is better. If it was closer I would go to movies all the time! \n\nAnother plus, everyone there is friendly and the parking lot is huge. If this is close to you and you like movies, you should be here!"}

{"input": "Having been to Greece and eaten at a villa-turned-resto a stone's throw from the sea separated by a white sand beach, the gustatory resonance of that experience still informs whether I think a resto is horrible or amazing. And this place is truly divine. \n\nI had a kedegree platter for brunch, and the rice was seasoned full of life and the veggies and fish were both extra fresh! I normally don't drink anything than water, but the mint tea + lemonade (lemonanna) was too intriguing to pass up, and boy I'm glad I splurged. That had to be one of the finest blends of balance I've had in a drink. \n\nI had always thought that this place was exorbitantly expensive, but my meal was actually very affordable for brunch. Dinner is still pricey. I do appreciate that there's an upscale vibe on the inside, however, alongside a more casual one under the outdoor awning."}
{"input": "The food was good, service was horrible. I ordered orange juice for my kids and waited till we were almost done eating then finally got the juices. They take cash or checks only. Everything else was OK, but they could do a little bit better on their service."}
{"input": "I love going in there just to look around. The prices are a bit high, but the store is like a Disneyland for adults. I LOVE IT!"}
{"input": "The food is excellent and the service was awesome, and Scot the Executive Chef and Proprietor makes you feel like you are part of the family. I got the grilled oyster and shrimp po'boy, and I asked for the Tabasco mayo. And if you like libations, the Old Fashion is definitely a good choice! Featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives"}
{"input": "Having worked 5 doors down from Fairmount Pet Shoppe for the last few months, I have been passing by and seeing the oh-so-cute kitties in the windows for a while now. Today, I finally relented and went in. \n\nKnow this about me: I love cats. I have 8 cats. My mission in life is making them happy. The wife and I buy them the best food we can, groom them and keep them general pampered pusses. I am a cat person. \n\nSoooo it is with AWSOMENESS that finally a pet shop opened which caters more to cats than dogs. Let's face it- dogs get the glory. Every pet shop- from the small boutique to the overwhelming superstores- is about 60% dogs, 25& cats, 15% everything else. \n\nBut not Fairmount Pet Shoppe. This joint is 75% cats. Who cares what else is there? NOT ME!!! Cat toys, cat grooming products, cat treats and best of all- CATS!\n\nProps for spelling \"shop\" the way they do. Pointless. And cool."}
{"input": "Went here 08/25/2017.  Over all rating is just OK.  Fries are on the sandwiches but they were cold and old.  Beer selection is mostly local type and server did not know much about any of them.  Food was underwhelming as was the entire experience.  Location is convenient but we dined outside and had two different people come to table and ask us for money when they were walking by the outside dining area."}
{"input": "I dig this place. Great Cobb salad. Great flatbreads. Amazing BBQ sandwich. Super solid ingredients, pretty good service and a nice cafe environment. Not the cheapest place in the world, but it has delicious food. Always worth it."}
{"input": "I highly recommend this place! This was our first \"Chef Tasting\"! It was exquisite!! We had 9 courses and all were truly delicious. Wine was amazing. If you are in Philly, I highly recommend Vetri."}
{"input": "In town for the weekend. I was headed to Starbucks and saw Northwest as I was driving by. I'm glad I stopped there. The House Blend coffee was excellent. Very  flavorful and smooth blend. Didn't need to to add anything to make it taste better as I would have done at Starbucks. The staff was very friendly and helpful."}

{"input": "Took a while to get actual service but once we did I was happy. The gumbo was awesome and loved the chicken & waffles. Friendly staff and right on Bourbon St for good people watching!"}
{"input": "TNT shrimp and the conch fritters were to die for. The lobster roll was really good. The appearance on the outside is a little iffy but it's a hidden gem on the inside :). Will definitely be back!"}
{"input": "A very nice hotel and a good value. ($175/night) The king bed was primo, the room tastefully furnished. The  rotating Carousel bar is fun and the pool at the top of the building is a great way to cool off on a 95 degree day.We stay there given the great location in the French  Quarter, but our room facing Royal St. was very loud, especially on Friday night. Try for a room not facing the street if you are there over a weekend. Make sure they remove the extra $60 per night they tack on to your room charge for incidentals."}
{"input": "Absolutely fantastic service! I made a last minute appointment for a mani pedi and was taken care of with such ease. My nails look perfect and an extremely relaxing experience overall. Everybody there is very sweet and accommodating :)"}
{"input": "Love love love this hotel!!! Had the most amazing time! Went for labor day weekend and needed a place to stay for Reno's annual Rib fest. The best stay ever. We had the deluxe room. Such a beautiful, luxurious and clean room! The bed was extremely comfy! The pool area is great! Plenty of lounge chairs, to where you don't have to rush to get a one. The bf and I ate at the island buffet which was just ok, for the price it was about right. Next time we go I definitely want to try the steakhouse and biscotti restaurant. We will be staying at this hotel every time we visit Reno!"}
{"input": "The service here is just incredible. I was always a little shy asking what whiskies to try.....its a whiskey bar filled with whiskey fans. I didnt be made fun of!\n\nBut nope. The bartender, Scott I believe his name was, told me about the flights. He said if I was a newbie, the flights wouldnt be that great for me and made me a custom flight. And it was perfect. I now know exactly what to get and what style I like. Scott was also there any time my glass was empty....even when the bar got packed, he was on top of ever drink order with the quickness. \n\nOh, and get food. Anything you get here is awesome."}
{"input": "Phenomenal!\n\nI was in NOLA for a conference and a local suggested this restaurant to me, so I checked it out with a co-worker on a Tuesday evening. The food and live music made for an incredible atmosphere. It would be a great date spot! I got the fish tacos and the crab cake/hangar steak, both of which were amazing. I would definitely make the effort to go back if I find myself in New Orleans again."}
{"input": "Nail technician was fast, but not 100% thorough. They didn't have the color I wanted (Mademoiselle.. a very common color!) Salon has chemical smell from the gels etc.\nWith so many salons in the area,  and the fact they charge the same price as the no chemical smelling slalom, will go to those  next time.."}
{"input": "Reasonable price for seafood, but not to die for. Seems like we ordered everything in mini size :( Clams were mostly shell only, mussels were almost the size of the baby clams. Dungeness was too salty, seasoning seemed like they just threw on pinches at a time. I think they could do better! Our server was too slow with requested items,  and it wasn't even busy when we were dining.  Overall seafood needs more taste. Butter and lemon will not cut it. We'll try it out again in another 3 months and hopefully they improve."}
{"input": "Place is horrible. They make it look on the website like it is a made to order deli but we disappointed to find this morning that it's actually just a couple day old sandwiches in a refrigerator and a bunch of random other crap. On top of that the sandwich was ass."}

{"input": "This is one of my favorite bead stores in Nashville, walls and walls of seed beads and glass strands!"}
{"input": "Had the tenders and chicken mix, and both were great. The tenders were not processed, but pulled chicken breast. Fries were perfect (crispy and slightly thicker than your average fry) and the honey biscuit was really great. Their daquries are good and large as well (apple, mango, pina colada, hurricane, hypnotic, margarita and more). I had the mango hurricane mix. Definitely good drunk or not."}
{"input": "Fabulous, quick, stress free windshield repair. .. didnt cost a penny out of pocket. I would definitely use this company again and would recommend to anybody!!"}
{"input": "I LOVE this place!  Every single thing I've had here is good and FRESH.  They do take a little longer than a grab and go, but thats what fresh requires.  Staff is very friendly and the decor is beautiful.\n\nThe owner's take pride in their place and it shows.  \n\nCAUTION: You will become addicted LOL."}
{"input": "This is not a review for all UPS Stores, but specifically for this one.  I ship something out multiple times per week and they are extremely fast every time.  They don't make me wait around for them to box it.  I have been here dozens of times and have always left quickly and satisfied.  They make my job easier.\n\nI stopped going to the Fedex Kinkos down on the circle as I always had to wait around and multiple employees were even rude to me!"}
{"input": "Delicious food.  The place is located outside of Nashville and the interior has a lot of rustic charm.  Their bbq ribs were moist and flavorful, mac n cheese was creamy, and their tacos were simple but delicious.  We also ordered the wings without the sauce and they were fried and seasoned perfectly.  Wished we lived nearby, would come here regularly for sure."}
{"input": "Long story short:  It was West Philly Comics 3 weeks ago and I was sorry to see the shop move...it was conveniently located by my house around UPenn;  however, I followed them because the owner impressed me with his customer service.  \n\nHe calls to check in with me about picking up my books, the service is great, the staff respectfully provides opinions on other graphic novels I might like.  Check them out.  The shop is smaller but the area has some good restaurants to chill or geek-out with friends or just read some killer graphic novel you bought.\n\nDrake"}
{"input": "Be patient, the owner/chef/cook whatever you want to call him, he's unqiue, talks a lot and can be difficult to understand but you can see he simply loves to cook. He doesn't skimp nor cheat you. He asks whatever you can pay for and gives you more. The food is great but its his love of customers & food that drives this business."}
{"input": "The Grand opening was really nice. They were passing out a lot menu items. They were really good and the service was excellent. Our waitress was very attentive and congenial. We had the roast beef poboy with mac n cheese. Poor quality. We also had a chocolate malt  really good."}
{"input": "I'm pretty sure this place has been open since before I was born and it's no surprise as to why. \n\nThe absolute classic of an American diner, polite and attentive waitresses and most of their food made entirely from scratch. I would definitely say their fried chicken is the best I've had before, and fresh! Bottomless coffee too, for $1.75 which I think is quite reasonable. Nice pie, too :)"}

{"input": "This little unassuming shop is tucked away in a strip mall full of furniture stores. Had it not been for Yelp, I would never have known it was here. Now, I won't be taking a trip to Brentwood without stopping for a scoop!\n\nThe flavors are quite varied and innovative. I had pumpkin and some sort of whipped cream cheese flavor--both were divine--which when mixed tasted just like pumpkin pie! The owner, Michael, is absolutely a sweetheart and is generous with the samples and the recommendations, and he's always coming up with new flavors to whip up. I can't wait to see what he concocts next!"}
{"input": "We did a one session clay workshop. At first we were super happy and enjoying the experience but the closer it got to the end of the session the less enjoyable it got. Our initially lovely teacher got cranky and short with all of the students. We felt rushed and the evening was ruined. When it came time to remove our clay from the spinning table the instructor ripped ours off and completely mushed the shape. We asked if it would or could be fixed and she advised she would fix it when she did the cutting and were snapped at to get cleaning up. When we left we were told 3-4 weeks until pick up and that we would be called. Three weeks went by and we called to check in. At that time we were advised they were ready a week later and we should have come sooner to get them. When we went in the squished pot was never fixed. We won't go to this place again which is disappointing because it started out so lovely."}

{"input": "My daughter and I go here often. Best FroYo in Reno. Creamier and better tasting yogurt than other FroYo places in town. Reasonably prices. You choose how much or how little yogurt and toppings to take. Paid for by weight, so be careful! This location is right next to Bertha Miranda's in the same building at the corner of Longley and S. Virginia."}
{"input": "Studying previous  yelp reviews, we decided to take the kids to hibachi and sushi.  This place did not disappoint. The sushi was amazing and the hibachi was awesome. The dessert of fried bananas and ice cream ended a great experience. The service was great and attentive.  Will definitely return for more!"}
{"input": "Recently moved here & been trying various meat & 3's with little success.\nCourtney's excels.  The best cornbread I've had in a long time.\nGreat chicken & sides, many choices...great service."}
{"input": "Really liked this place. \n\nIt was a bit busy as it was a Sunday morning when we visited so I feel like our waitress was a bit overwhelmed however, the food was so good. I love the fresh and healthy options. I had avocado smashed w/olive oil and salt over toast and their fresh juice. Awesome."}
{"input": "I'm from out of town and picked up an awful sinus infection. I neeeeeded hot and sour soup. I got broth with some vegetables and about 2 ounces of corse ground pepper. It was awful. I ordered for my son and husband and their food was awful. The crab Rangoon was burnt. \nThree entrees, 1 pint hot and sour soup and one order crab Rangoon. It was almost 60 bucks for tiny boxes of food."}
{"input": "Got the vegan bowl and my sister got the vegan burrito with siracha cauliflower in it(the best tasting cauliflower by the way).  We also got the loaded vegan fries. Overall, the second best vegan meal. Will be back soon!"}
{"input": "I came here with a group of four and had a great experience. There are tons of interesting appetizers to try--we had dumplings with corn and mushrooms, wings, and some specials that are escaping me. Each of us also got an order of noodles. These are not chinatown noodle house portions, but they also aren't chinatown noodle house ingredients. Interesting, fresh, and tasty. Plus its a great deal and BYO to boot. Great addition to 10th street!"}
{"input": "Great place to go for breakfast, brunch, lunch or whatever! Service is great...selections are great for coffee, tea and now beer and wine! Atmosphere is nice and laid back. Staff actually remembers your name."}
{"input": "We went to Burger Up for the first time recently during a trip to Nashville. I ordered a burger with sweet potato fries. The burger was pretty good, but the fries were cold. Not warm at all. I would have sent them back but the wait itself for the food was a bit much, didn't want to wait longer for warm fries. My husband asked for ketchup for his fries but the waiter forgot it. My husband liked his burger."}
{"input": "Nice. Great room; Great price. Had a little problem with the hot water the first night, but it got better. They offered a free night due the problem. Nice location of the French Quarter. The fourth floor concierge lounge was not much."}
{"input": "If you're looking for cheap, fast, and decent tacos this place rocks. I like the ordering process itself.  Got guacamole tacos which were delicious but I think the guacamole could be a little fresher, was just a tad too dark. \n\nVery chill setup that reminds me of the place in That 70's Show.... but with tacos."}
{"input": "don't order the chips they're awful! I told our waitress they were stale and she was very nice but said that everyone thinks they're stale but that's just the chips they use."}
{"input": "Came late Friday night for a bite to eat. Much of the soup, hot takeaway were cleaned up. Settled for an individual pizza to share. Crust was too thick, but we could debate pies until the cows come home. Wandered the store while it was baking and found Scharffenberger chocolate! Pie may not be up to our standard but the chocolate hit the spot. At 8pm at night, the staff was exhausted"}
{"input": "Take someone with you when visiting the Mello Freeze.  This will allow you to at least sample two different items.  Growing up in the area brings back great memories...The brown derbies, the slushes, crunch cones, slushes with ice cream.  Yummy!"}
{"input": "Excellent place for gelato! The best there is on St. Louis! Lovely garden patio in the rear, ample seating with tables and armchairs both downstairs and upstairs, with free wifi throughout!"}
{"input": "Tried this place the other day the pizza was not very good at all the place before this one was so much better all home made food with it would've stuck around"}
{"input": "Restaurant has an excellent service, good tasting food, for someone on a rush, or someone looking to have a vegan experience.. I Totally recommended."}
{"input": "Amazing day with Shawn!! He was punctual even though some in group were not!! Loved each winery and the brewery - he was excellent in explaining the wine process.   Great day. And a fabulous wine bottle surprise at the end!!"}
{"input": "No better department store in the world.  A Texas tradition.....they publish the world famous NM Christmas Catalog....Never seen it? You should.\n\nGreat service in the Tampa store at International mall."}
{"input": "Overpriced for what you get. I think this is a cute spot to meet up with a friend, but that's about it. I prefer my own homemade coffee to be honest. Adorable concept, just could use some improvement to products offered and prices."}
{"input": "Love it here\n\nThe atmosphere is great the options are more than average and the lunch bento boxes are great.  If you have the opportunity always try the boba as well.\n\nThose complaining are just picky and should go back to eating at home.  \n\nTry their beef braised soup as it is hearty and delicious."}
{"input": "Great atmosphere with a large outdoor seating area. Usually great bands. And love that you can pick out your cheeses and they will make a rather large cheeseboard for you! Place can get packed especially if it starts to rain!"}
{"input": "Very cute brunch spot. Avocado toast is filling and worth the hype. Loved every bite."}
{"input": "I stopped in here on my way to another restaurant, it looked that good. I got in and scanned the menu. But the only thing I could see was the Fatty Filet. Nothing else would register. So, after I clarified what the waitress the explanation of what Tobacco fries where, I made my order. \nDelicious.\nNot sure what else they sell, but the Fatty was spectacular."}
{"input": "$0.75 oysters were delicious and I'm not even usually an oyster eater. We sat at the bar and the service was wonderful. We ordered the shrimp and grits for the two of us and it came out already split. Drinks were strong and a great value at 50% off. I would recommend the French 75. Gumbo was pretty good too. Happy hour is 3-6!"}
{"input": "When I moved from Philly to NYC, one of the biggest things I was worried about was finding a spin studio I loved as much as SoulCycle.  I found others to pass the time, but when RHSQ finally opened its doors in March, I knew I was home again.  I leave each class with the feeling of an incredible burn and my heart full thanks to the motivation and dedication of the studio instructors.  I have taken pretty much every instructor's class and could not even tell you my favorite.  If I had to Nick Turk and Ryan take the cake, I don't know how they do it, but they leave you feeling with a sense of balance and an incredible satisfaction of a great workout.\n\nFor beginners or those trying SoulCycle for the first time, do not be intimidated.  That was my biggest thing when I started, I was intimidated, but the Soul community is a force to be reckoned with and once you're in, you're part of the family.  \n\nI love this place.  My bank account doesn't, but it's worth every penny."}
{"input": "I recently ate here after driving by several times. I was originally tuned off by menu I first saw due to the pricey entrees . They have since changed and now offer 17 dollar entrees. Food was excellent and the service was perfect. I'm glad to have a local place with great food. I have read several reviews that seem to target the chef.. I have never met him but it seems as if some people have an axe to grind.. Simply put.. The homemade linguine with seafood was unbelievable... The buffalo cracklings were amazing. I wish I had some right now!  Great food in a cozy atmosphere served up by smiling staff... We will be eating here regularly..."}
{"input": "I love pho and this place did not let me down.  I had the pho with rare flank and brisket.  The broth was heavenly, the meat plentiful, the noodles cooked to perfection.  I will definitely go back for more.  The price point is more than fair.  I had the medium bowl and it was more than enough for one person.  Highly recommend!"}
{"input": "Second time eating here, I had the classic cheeseburger with sweet potato fries.  Good burger, really good fries.  Service was good.  Atmosphere is upbeat, high-end casual.  Decent noise level for group conversation.  $12 for burger & fries is pricey for the size of this burger.  There are better places for a burger.  Huge selection of beers on tap makes this a great place to hang out and drink with friends though."}
{"input": "Reading the other reviews, I would have to agree that if one wants to 'wander through' a voo doo shop in New Orleans, this is the place to go.  But if one is actually seeking to embrace the art, it is even better than a shop, it is a spiritual mecca.  The people here are not the stereotypical 'scary' folks from television and film, they are lovely, genuine people whose practice is founded in a belief centered around helping others.  Without being an expert in the field, I can say that they counsel and practice from the best of places.  And the charms they made for my new office worked! (They are the first to tell you that any juju for success must be coupled with effort and skill, but just the same, we've been remarkably successful early on, and I know their blessings were in part responsible).  Love them.  Will be back in April, as they are a must stop shop, whatever the reason for dropping in."}
{"input": "An outstanding collection! Very spacious and my first impression was that it might be a bit too suburban, but I was pleasantly surprised to find many edgy and funky pieces for great prices! A great experience! Wonderful service and ambience too!"}
{"input": "Great menu & cozy place but probably better for dinner than brunch.   it's very small so don't bring more than 4 people, they only have one large table.   The menu is small but everything sounds great.  We would have tried more things but they were out of about 50% of the items:  doughnuts, pancakes, french toast & waffles. Which is probably a testament to how good the place is but not so great as a patron.   \n\nThe Sequel & Eggs Benedict were marvelous.  Atmosphere is cool, but our server might have been having an off day.  They also seem weird about bringing you salt and don't have hot sauce but that's forgiveable.  Not forgiveable:  the Bloody Wilbur.  visually gross looking (and can't stress that enough!) and not much on flavor.  don't tease about Bacon Flavored vodka and not deliver.  Also odd:  the biscuits & gravy tasted like supreme pizza.  not awful but weird i guess, good if you really like supreme pizza for breakfast.   to each is own!"}
{"input": "Finally got to check out Cafe Soleil. One word: Delicieux!! Being from France, I had high expectations, I don't play with my pastries! Boy do they deliver, the croissants were buttery, nice and flaky, and melt in your mouth...even better then some of the ones I had in France. Not surprisingly, the baker \"Nico\" is french, and you could taste the difference in the food.  The fact that the products are imported does make a big difference in the taste, it's definitely authentic.  Nico was very personable and friendly, it was fun chatting with an ex-parisian :). The one negative thing is they are too far from me, 45 mins drive, but to satiate my sweet tooth, I will definitely be back! I highly recommend this bakery."}
{"input": "The bourbon chicken wings are to die for!!! Beyond delicious!!!! A great selection and GMO conscious!!! Woo hoo!!! Service was great, food was great, everything was great. I would come here again and again!!!"}
{"input": "My IPad quit charging so I bought it to Fixit to be repaired and paid $30. They called to tell me it wasn't the battery or the charging port but, was the mother board and they couldn't fix it. I saw a video on line that showed how to install a jumper to bypass the motherboard and asked if they could do that, they declined.  I asked them to not put the IPad back together leave it apart put it in a bag and I will pick it up. When I picked it up they had put it back together I asked why and was told they didn't want to lose any parts. So I paid $30 for nothing because they don't have bags or don't listen to your wishes."}
{"input": "Fun place, inviting interior and a pleasure to hang outside with the couches, etc. brunch food was very good, and beer selection exceptional.  Waiter, however, was a disaster.  Was jerky to us from the beginning (we were all sitting around asking each other why he was being such an asshole to us), did not know the menu at all, constantly disappeared on us, and was argumentative when he brought out the wrong order (twice).  Otherwise, would have gotten 4 stars."}
{"input": "This place was the perfect location, the perfect price, and the perfect choice for our stay in New Orleans. If you're looking to stay in the French Quarter and need a place to sleep this is the perfect hotel. The staff is extremely friendly, they had a free breakfast, and the hotel was very well maintained. \n\nIf you're looking for a hotel that your planning on spending a lot of time in you may want to look elsewhere. The rooms were nothing to wright home about and weren't very \"romantic\". \n\nIf we were to go back to New Orleans we would book Hotel Provincial again."}
{"input": "Wow, this place took the hassle out of everything! I was in and out in no time. The guy who answered the phone was funny and courteous.  The woman who did my smog was knowledgeable and very helpful. Definitely going back year after year!"}
{"input": "First of all, I know from working in customer service, that the way these people speak to you is not acceptable. I went in to get a ring for a facial piercing and the man working was so condescending and rude, telling me I was disrespectful for \"touching\" my nose in the shop. He could have easily told me nicely that that was a rule they had, but instead he made me feel like a complete idiot. The woman working was nice and helped me out. But they charged me for two rings that didn't even fit and then tried telling me to wait a couple months and try to stretch out my hole instead of just offering to refund the money. They also tried telling me most places don't sell 20 gauges and then I went to the tattoo shop across the street and they told me completely otherwise. Luckily, it ended up working out because the people at energy tattoo actually have good customer service and helped me out. \nBad vibes from golden eagle. Won't be going here again."}
{"input": "#TampaBayBrewingAn outstanding #Brewery and Food establishment. The Brew is wonderfully diverse and Delicious while the Food is On Point\nThe atmosphere and service at #Westchase(sure it's the same in #Ybor)is wonderful and makes you never want to leave.\nA MUST if you've never been here\nLoved the \"Grand Raison Belgian Strong Ale 12.2%\" WOW\nToo bad there aren't more Stars"}
{"input": "I ordered chicken tikka masala and fish curry for dinner. They didn't taste as fresh and good as I have expected. However, the owner of restaurant called back right away and apologized. I was impressed by the restaurant's candor and diligence in customer satisfaction. Thus, I think I am going to go back and try it again in a few weeks to see whether there is any improvement in the quality of food."}
{"input": "I went to see Dr. Lake with pretty severe knee trouble (i.e. ongoing and increasing pain, popping, cracking when walking, going up/down stairs, sitting, etc).  Dr. Lake was very nice, but his assistant was a challenge to deal with.  Dr. Lake prescribed an MRI, which was denied by my insurance company.  My insurance company said the doctor could appeal the decision by writing a letter, so I called the office.  Tracy, Dr. Lake's assistant at Premiere, said they would not be willing to write the letter to appeal.  When I asked why Premiere wouldn't write the appeal, she said \"Talk to your insurance company\" and hung up.  Headed over to Penn Orthopedics, who said they'd get me the MRI."}
{"input": "This place is amazing, and if you're a foodie you will be very impressed!  Do get there early though.  For the full menu, you need to be seated by 9, or you will have a wait.  We get there at 830 or 845 get pastries from the coffee bar and then order at 9... we have kiddo's so we don't like to wait too long.  By the way, it's great for kids, and the decor and vibe is very unique and awesome.  We love the lox pastry that you can get at the counter, their espresso is top notch, our kiddos love the ovaltine on the menu, and the boozy campfire cookies (although just a cookie, it is THE BEST cookie i've ever had) .  We've also had the cinnamon sugar donut holes (amazing!) and much more... but I'll just leave it at that.  Enjoy!"}
{"input": "Not at all impressed...dingy and not the cleanest.  I actually was scared to place my luggage anywhere near the floor.  I think this may have been former government housing.   Trying to figure out how it has the Marriott name.  I do have to say, the front desk people in addition to the breakfast ladies, were professional and polite.  The hotel is just in desperate need of renovation."}
{"input": "Best sushi we have ever had. Very friendly service too.  Try the Toro press box.  Also the coconut curry mango shrimp.  Prices are a little higher but worth it.  We got there before 5 and beat the crowd."}
{"input": "Awesome place! The atmosphere of this market is great. The outdoor patio area is really modern and pleasing and it overlooks the train tracks. I ordered the hummus sandwich, which was delicious. I really liked how it came with a pickle and chips and the portion was rather large to where I wasn't hungry for dinner...so bring your appetite. \n\nThe inside market has a wide selection of bottles of wine at what appeared to be decent prices. They also sell frozen tamales and other delicious looking treats. Next time I'm in Tucson, this place is on the list!"}
{"input": "Second time at the great restaurant. I liked everything on the very fresh menu. Great atmosphere,great service. More than two staff plus chef came to the table to check on our meal and if we were enjoying our meal."}
{"input": "On the way back home if traveling on Route 42 instead of the AC Expressway I always stop at Licio's. If it is an early stop it might just be for some of their great bread, and a piece of pizza. At lunch I would  get one of my two favorites; The Minute Man (Italian) or the Wedgewood Paisano which has different Italian meats in it) both are delicious. My wife loves their Vilotti Veggie with Oven Roasted Portobello Mushrooms or Eggplant, Roasted Red Peppers, Broccoli Rabe & Sharp Provolone. I try not to load up on their tasty baked goods but trying to decide on whether to get a canolli or Sfogliatelle is tough."}
{"input": "Sweet spot in the Waterline. Came for some live music with friends on Saturday. Very cool. Best local beer in town by far. Seems like the concept is a few notches up from Fig Mountain. Definitely prefer Topa. Even cooler is that you can order incredible food from the Nook Restaurant, and walk two feet into Lama Dog which is part of the Waterline. I love it!!"}
{"input": "I want to like this place: it's just down the street from where I live, and I really really want to live down the street from a great Thai restaurant. Unfortunately, this place doesn't do it.\n\nI worry that this is a case of excessively high expectations (due to the high Yelp ratings), but I've been twice and was underwhelmed both times. The spring rolls mentioned in other reviews were truly beautiful looking, but without the peanut sauce they were flavorless. I also tried the Tom Kha Kai, the papaya salad, a salmon dish that was the special of the evening, a curry, and another dish or two that I can no longer remember. The papaya salad was delicious (although a little light on the papaya part), the rest was forgettable. This place may be authentic (for all I know) but I prefer many of the other Thai restaurants in town. Much to my dismay."}
{"input": "After coming here for many years, I was very disappointed by my last trip. The one place you never cut corners is in the food, and that's exactly what they did. 2 of the 3 salsas were so watery that you didn't get any tomatillo or tomato on your chip, at all. The third salsa, the pics de gallo, was the worst chop job I've ever seen in a restaurant. Huge pieces of Serrano pepper with varying sizes of everything else, and in stark contrast to the other 2, completely dried out. \n\nWithout even looking at the menu, I know what I want... #15. That decision hasn't changed for over 10 years. Today I should have made a different choice. I'm not sure if they recently went thru a purveyor change but the quality of everything on the plate was horrible. \n\nI used to love the rice, it changed. I used to love the chicken quesadilla, now it's flavorless and covered in 2 lbs of cheese for 1/2 a breast.\n\nPlease go back to your old ways and cut costs elsewhere, other than the food."}
{"input": "I am sort of a simple man, so I had never been to a liquor bar before. I have been to The Libertine twice and had a good experience both times. They use fresh ingredients all the way down to the crushed ice, which they crush with a mallet right at the bar. \n\nThe biggest problem I ran into was figuring out which restroom was the men's. You have to look at the hair on the dimly lit pictures that indicate which is which, all the faces look the same."}
{"input": "The chicken and the ribs entrees were overly-salty. I like my foods full of flavor, but not salt. But still it was pretty good, and the parking lot was convenient. The sides were good though."}
{"input": "i didnt want to give up a star but... the place sucks!"}
{"input": "I was on a trip to Philadelphia when I had my very first Cannolis there and OMG I wasn't disappointed! \n\nFresh, sweet, and addictive are the best three words to describe my Cannolis experience! The filling comes in three different flavours, chocolate, vanilla, and ricotta with chocolate chips. I tried the ricotta and chocolate chips one and I can't even describe how heavenly it was. \n\nOn the other hand, I tried their Éclaires, naah not that good and I definitely had better ones in several other places. But hey, it's an Italian shop, didn't expect them to make great French pastry anyways.\n\nI live in VA but I'd drive all the way back to Philly for those cannolis. \nBottom line, this place gets 5 stars from me because of the cannollis."}
{"input": "I'm typically a carnivore, but Hip City Veg was very tasty!  I had the fajita wrap for lunch.  It was a little pricey (around $9) for me, but it was big and filling and delicious.  It was busy around lunch but the service was apt and friendly."}
{"input": "Best nail spa in town.  It is peaceful and quiet unlike some of the other chaotic nail salons in Green Hills.  It's always a pleasant experience, and my nails always look great."}
{"input": "An upscale mexican joint? Really?! I enjoy good authentic mexican food, this is by far the most upscale Ive seen.  Im more of the food trucks and hole in the walls type, so this was different than what Im used to. \n\nThe atmosphere at Besito is tough to beat. They have Merengue & Salsa on the background which doesn't really go with the Mexican theme but who's paying attention. An ideal Date night atmosphere for sure. \n\nFood was very good but I must say a bit on the pricey side, you have to consider the fact that you are paying for more than a meal... You have the valet outside, truly great service, our waiter was friendly and happy to discuss the menu, he more than met our expectations. \n\nGuess if you and your date love Mexican food, and feel like taking it to another level for once, Besito is your place. It's a gourmet mexican restaurant, certainly worth trying."}
{"input": "I did not have a problem with the restaurant my food was good I got the steak sandwich with the French onion soup. The place was clean and presentable I would recommend the restaurant. The only issue I had was the guy taking my order he needs to be retrained as I asked for my sandwich and for my French Onion soup after that he told me the total without even allow me to get a drink. After giving me my total I asked for a bottle water, he seemed bothered that he had add something else to my order. The guy just seemed like he didn't want to be there, he is someone who I would want to interact with my customers. I didn't get his name but I added a picture on here"}
{"input": "First off the bathroom smell like dirty seafood which almost took away my appetite to start with we order the king crab and lobster tacos there was hardly any meat in the king crab and considering that it was more expensive than the 3 pounds of a different kind of crab you would think that there would've been plenty of meat My lobster tacos was over an under cooked but the next two days hunched over the toilet so disappointed"}
{"input": "Not what I was expecting, very disappointing! After all the great reviews I expected much more. The atmosphere is great! Food was hot and came out fast, but was very bland. Everything looked amazing when it arrived but wasn't seasoned!! Everything from the salad dressing (Italian) to the dipping sauces, to the sauce on my pasta was extremely oily and over powering. This place is not worth the trip or the money!! Only plus is that the shrimp were deveined."}
{"input": "What can I say, Herbie's has provided another wonderful Happy Hour for me and my friends. We had great food and wonderful service. Our waitress was attentive, knowledgable and gave wonderful advice on cocktails.I had the seasonal heirloom caprese salad and a taste of flatbread with chicken, spinach and jalapenos. They were both absolutely amazing. It is a bit pricey so if you want to go the budget route this place is not for you."}
{"input": "Its a good location.I don't like the coffee at the place next door, but combine a Starbucks coffee with a tart from the other place and its a win-win. Well maybe not for my waist line or pocket book. \n\nI like they have large common tables with plenty of outlets under them for computers. I really appreciate the multiple outlet on the walls. Too many people bogart every one of the power plugs, but thats not going to happen here."}
{"input": "Great smoked fish and the fish spread is amazing. I reccommend getting the smoked salmon, or mackarel."}
{"input": "This is really great pizza. The Hawaiian pizza has fresh pineapple not from a can. They will make pizza slices with what you want, but they don't really want to. Compared to what is in the area, this one is the best pizza."}
{"input": "Great breakfast place! Off the main strip. Still very new so not too busy. \nI had the Louisiana Skillet with crawfish and andouille  sausage. My wife had the broken egg chicken biscuit sandwich. Both were excellent!! \nWas tempted on getting the crab cakes Benedict. Definitely next time!"}
{"input": "Update: Lowered my review by one star.  I still frequent this place for breakfast fairly regularly and it doesn't disappoint.  Always decent, never WOW amazing.  The A/C used to be blasting all the time, a great perk for that hangover hot feeling.  Now its much warmer... maybe they finally realized their entergy bill was more than their rent."}
{"input": "I  drove  by  this  restaurant  last  night.  What  a  fun ,  brightly  lit  neighborhood.  I  hope  to  return  and  eat  here.  Looks  like  Florida  has  some  great  new  nightlife.\nHidden  somewhere  between  Ybor  City  and  downtown  Tampa...."}
{"input": "I'm giving my visit to Aveda Institute a 5 for a series of reasons, and the price is definitely a factor.\n\nFor $16, I was greeted promptly (promptly in my book at a salon is within 15 minutes of my appointment) by my student stylist, Miata. Miata is about the cutest sweetest thing north of Atlanta as far as I am concerned. She was talkative and had a lot of suggestions for what I could do with my hair. \n\nShe also listened to exactly what I wanted -- and delivered. I have fairly course hair (for a white girl) and I don't treat it with much, nor do I blow it dry (on my own it never works). She cut a little less than an inch off (my guesstimation), feathered in fantastic layers, and then blew out my hair. \n\n\nI am extremely satisfied -- I normally can't have this type of a cut without spending upwards of $50. \n\nDefinitely tip, but I think they pool tips, FYI. \n\nMy bf has an appointment on Saturday, so I'll update then."}
{"input": "I haven't had too much Greek food in my life (other than your typical gyros). I have been to Athens though...and had pretty good food there (really good lambs, street-gyros, and a lot of mythos beer).\n\nEating at this restaurant on a hot, humid summer day brought me back to my trip to Athens, except that I didn't have the view of greek ruins lit up at night, those narrow winding streets, or bottles of mythos on my table (it's a BYOB).\n\nBut the food did bring me back to my memories in Greece. We had the dips, moussaka, rabbit, and lamb. I can't say anything bad about them. However, the meal wasn't spectacular...it just didn't have that extra flare for me to give that last star (then again, I'm a big food snob). I would recommend the place to anyone looking for Greek cuisine, and I would definitely recommend coming here during summer and getting a seat outdoor."}
{"input": "Horrible horrible!!! Got a flat tire.. took them 3 hours to send somebody!! I know the flat tire happens but 3 hours??!! When I was only 20 min from the rental car center... I will never use them again.. I travel every week and thought I would give them a try.."}
{"input": "Went on a Sunday afternoon and there were only a handful of people there.  We sat at the bar and were greeted by a bartender who started by telling us they were out of most food items.  No worries, we just wanted a couple of beers.  We sampled several varieties, all of which were average.  Nothing memorable about any of the six styles we tried.\n\nUnfortunately,  the staff was in a snit because their relief was late.  I get it, but they were having a full blown discussion behind the bar which all patrons could hear.  Kind of put a damper on things.\n\nCool location and cool place, but not sure we would go back based on this visit as there are better options near by."}
{"input": "This review is based on the location in Atlantic city.\n\nGot the strawberry flavor and O.M.G!!! I was not expecting it to be that good. It is not as sweet as others but it's perfect. It had little bits of strawberry in it. The price is really good also $2 for a small I believe. My only regret is not trying all the other flavors. Next time I'm in Philly/AC I will def be getting this!"}
{"input": "Rarely do I come here(by design) but today it was more convenient to do so. My main issue with this and other military barbershops is that there is usually only one or two barbers that can cut ethnic hair well. Usually those with said hair know exactly who that is, which means there is always a wait for this barber. There are very few things I hate waiting on more than a haircut, so I usually avoid these places. Today however was my lucky day. The one gentleman who usually has a line was available, and I quickly jumped in his chair. He did a great job, while discussing fantasy and real football. He also didn't keep digging his clippers into my scalp for my line up, which a lot of other barbers seem to do. I left satisfied and went on with my more important plans for the day happily. Oh, and the dude to see is the tall gentleman in the first chair on your left upon entry. You're welcome."}
{"input": "OK. Decent place for pancakes and breakfast. Is it worth the ridiculous line that usually forms and runs out the door and around the corner? No. I'd rather go to Waffle House, eat, drive back home, get in comfy pj's and watch a game on the couch than still be there standing in line.\n\nAgain, good food, worth the money, not worth the ridiculous wait. Go when you can walk right in and eat without a wait. It'll make it taste better. I promise."}
{"input": "Oh my goodness their Mac and cheese is to die for. Tried it for the first time today since they \"popped up\" at our office building. I expected plain Mac and cheese but it was soo much better then Mac and cheese. I also got their chicken tenders and the biscuit. Equally good!"}
{"input": "I love pump it up and have happily gone there for years...however, I had a really gross and disappointing experience today. About 25 minutes into our 90 minute Open Jump, a child threw up...retching sounds in the obstacle course and full on vomit outside the slide. The workers cleaned up the carpet, but not only didn't check the obstacle course, but let the child return and play! I asked all three employees about their policy and they said \"We can't  ask him to leave because he's a paying customer\" and wouldn't refund our money so we could go another day. You will lose your healthy customers until you assure them their kids aren't playing alongside vomit and fevers."}
{"input": "My favorite hang out for food and ambiance, speak some French, outdoors. It does not get better than that!"}
{"input": "Excellent staff and services.  They took all of the concerns and mystery out of oral surgery.  Definitely a place to get Excellent, respectful treatment."}
{"input": "I ordered my one pizza online and went to get it in the time that they had recommended. The pizza was almost cold when I got it and had to reheat it in the oven. Overall not the best pizza experience and the dough almost tasted just like digiorno's pizza. The toppings might have been good if it weren't so Luke warm. Probably won't go again."}
{"input": "Really, really love this bar. The drinks were great, just enough alcohol and not too expensive. Staff was pretty fast in serving us. The live music was what made us go in and it was so good it kept us in for a great number of hours. I would definitely visit the 21st Amendment again if we ever get to visit NOLA gain."}
{"input": "We had so much fun on Friday night that we came back on Saturday. The bartenders here are super nice and even recognized us. The music was great on Friday with lots of hip hop. It's a spacey venue and has outdoor area so plenty of space to hang out without feeling like a packed can of sardines. Fun place overall."}
{"input": "I assumed brews meant beer  once I got over that I appreciated the Donuts. I mean Donuts and beer would seriously be the greatest  pairing since PB&J. My friends assumed beer also. We came for beer and stayed for the Donuts which were amazing and giant but it wasn't memorable amazing it was \"ohh these are giant donuts they made in front of me. Me and friends ordered different ones so we could sample each others. The establishment was cool but again I repeat there are no beers. Just nice people and Donuts."}
{"input": "We stayed at the Sheraton and they recommend this place. It was really great. I had the sampler and it was amazing, especially the crawfish ettouffe ! My husband had the shrimp and grits and he loved it. The staff was very friendly, I will definitely come again."}
{"input": "So much care is given to healthy, delicious food (ex. Japanese squash rather than white potatoes in curry). Thay have nice touches like a welcome snack and straw wrappers twisted in a rose. The sauces are amazing, menu has so many options, they accomodate special dietary needs easily since everything is made from scratch; even the desserts have that extra touch using both white and black sticky rice. This is our go-to for Thai from now on!"}
{"input": "Good basic pizza. Good crust. Typical older pizza place environment. Friendly to newbies. Would go there again."}
{"input": "Hands down the best pancakes I have ever had.  I have been here 4 times already and I have never been disappointed. The pancakes here are so good and the milky cinnamon syrup that they serve is the best thing I've put in my mouth. Must try are the sweet potato pancakes and the banana pancakes. I've also tried their eggs and sausage combo and their omelettes and they both were amazing.  The great thing about the combos is that you can substitute your regular buttermilk pancakes with any of the specialty pancakes. If you want a hearty meal I recommend the omelette. The staff is really nice and the inside is bigger than I thought when I was outside. The only downside about the place is that if you go on weekends there is going to be a line that is wrapped abound the building. This place is super popular when tourists so it might be a long wait, but I think it is so worth."}
{"input": "This place has great food, a great atmosphere, and very friendly staff. Hubby and happened upon this place accidentally and I'm glad we did. We will definitely be back...and we'll bring friends."}
{"input": "I stumbled on this adorable local coffee house while waiting for a store to open in the same shopping center. The service was excellent. It's well furnished with both tables and lounge areas, including a small reading book. Cute, cute, cute! And....the coffee is brewed to perfection."}
{"input": "Good:  very clean. I saw a housekeeper wiping drawers out. Carpet, bathroom, etc all very clean. Lots to do and a neat atmosphere. Great for conferences. Bad: tiny bathrooms. Small rooms in general. Restaurants are overpriced because they can. During conferences they sell parlor rooms separate from regular rooms. NOT worth it. Though the room is large you will be sleeping on pull out sofa and wake with sore back and neck. As a Platinum member I expected to be \"upgraded\" to a regular room as there were many available due to last minute cancellations. No such luck. Make sure to book a normal room or go elsewhere. Internet speed was okay. Location is near a mall and a short cab ride to downtown."}
{"input": "I have to admit, I'm kind of over Starr restaurants.  They were cool 5 years ago, but they seem to be a dime a dozen anymore.  That said, I still do love Jones, after all of these years.  The service is generally pretty good.  I still love the decor, feeling like I'm stepping into the Brady Bunches living room.  The food is great when you want comfort food.  \n\nOn the downside, it's always crowded, even during lunch hour.   But I guess the upside is the food and the fact that the people that work there aren't full of themselves, the way that most other servers are in his restaurants."}
{"input": "We stayed at the Four Points for 3 nights in November, while here on business.  Nice hotel, and a good experience. \n\nCheck in was a breeze.  We had a good price on the room via my Sheraton/SPG member and AAA discount, which included the free breakfast.  The hotel is literally 5 minutes from the airport, and there are several other hotels right on the same block.\n\nStaff was friendly and helpful.  Room was fine, parking easy, quiet at night."}
{"input": "I was in Indianapolis on business and walked to Joe's from my hotel to watch the Super Bowl (they have a wall - sized screen! )  The teriyaki wings were really good.  The drinks were generous and the bartender was friendly. The weekday specials look interesting. I'll definitely come back when I am in on this side of the city."}
{"input": "First, I want to clarify that the service was great! Unfortunately the food sucked so hard that they only came out with the rare one-star rating. \nI was really, really disappointed in the quality of food! It was basically inedible...the best thing was my daughter's French toast (which was still just average). My meal was hash browns covered in peppers & onions, salsa and cheese. The peppers & onions weren't fully cooked, the hash browns were like mush and it was smothered in plain old pace salsa from a jar. Sick. And so, so disappointing. Also incredibly over priced at $10 for a breakfast meal. We had 2 adult and 1 child meals, and used a free meal coupon and the bill still managed to be over $20?! When we go to Cracker Barrel around the corner the tab is $22 (no coupons or discounts) and we get way more food of much higher quality. Breakfasts will be at Cracker Barrel from now on!"}
{"input": "Most under-rated brewery on this list. Sun King is garbage. It's just popular from publicity and ads. Granite City has amazing food as well. Keep away from their mixed drinks. Their margaritas are a joke. Downtown location is better than Carmel."}
{"input": "My friend and I went for a late dinner. Very nice, music was play as a background so we could actually talk. Our server was very pleasant and fast. We both had the NY strip and were both very pleased. Will return."}
{"input": "Place is empty and there is a 40 minute wait. The problem I have is the snooty attitude of the waitress. Then  after our\nlong wait we found out people called in and she said she caught us kissing at the sunset and said how cute we were. Luv her then she showed us to the table before the server came. Which is Tom...was is phenomenal!"}
{"input": "The little deli belongs in little Italy. Wonderful subs, pastas, desserts and deli items. TOP NOTCH subs.  Always busy so don't be a douche and give a 1 star review because your delivery took too long. Call ahead for pick up.\nAfter coworkers see you eating anything from here, they will want in next time you go."}
{"input": "The good... Sangria and Guacamole, but way overpriced compared to other Mex Restaurants in Tucson\nThe Bad... Taco plates were skimpy, overpriced. Moreover, the tortillas were mushy.\nThe Terrible...The rest rooms are not clearly marked. You have to go thru an exit door (with crash bar) to get to them. The feeling is that if you go thru the door, you can not return. The ADA ramp may be compliant, but coming back thru (the exit door), the lighting is poor. It would be very easy for someone to get really hurt."}
{"input": "Our family's favorite place for breakfast.  The hashbrowns are the reason to go... along with the Eggs Provencale.  My son loves the french toast with fresh strawberries so much, he eats an adults serving, no problem.  Visit the attached bakery for some of the best pastries in Tucson. \n\nIt could be a scary location for non-Tucson natives, but don't fret.  This kind of weird setting (in a ghetto strip mall, next to a crappy Safeway) is what Tucson is all about.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"input": "Food is quite tasty, I was skeptical because it's a chaotic mess in there with some sort of assembly line to get your food, however much of it gets pieced together at the register."}
{"input": "The food and service was amazing! I only wish they had any vegetarian/vegan options. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"input": "Really enjoyed zinger burger here! This place was small but the service was very quick! Good KFC experience, will come back to have more zingers!"}
{"input": "Some Haikus:\n\n\n\nFree Ice Cream Cone Day:\nYou closed early, left me out\nAlone and hungry.\n\n\"Come back tomorrow, \nand I'll give you a small cone\nfor $4.23.\"\n\nI smiled and left\nDejected, still hungry, but--\nTen points for humor.\n\n\nPreviously, I\nStopped in for Beer and Donut\nIce Cream. Delicious.\n\nHooray for Simpsons-\nThemed treats and stores that sell them.\n(and free samples, too!)"}
{"input": "My best friend and I got an Airbnb in the area and this place was suggested to us by the owner. We loved it so much we went twice on our trip. Ambience is amazing... outdoor patio with jazzy vibes and dim lit lighting. It was our first taste of New Orleans and it didn't disappoint. We chose 2 bottles of Italian wine and did a cheese board. SO GOOD. Definitely suggest going here!"}
{"input": "Decent place to study, work and what have you. Awesome, friendly and smiley staff. Moderately priced cafe fare. Ample tables and outlets. Hands down one of my fav cafes in Philly."}
{"input": "Good menu, solid ingredients, but these folks are not sandwich artists.  I had a Turkey and Brie Wrap one day and the Spinach Florentine Wrap the next.  Both \"wraps\" could have more fittingly been called \"crumples\" because that's how they were assembled.  While watching the sandwich line I kept thinking, \"Thank god they're not trying to fold burritos!\"  Everyone in the sandwich line either looked befuddled by anything other than a plain bagel or like they were supposed to be somewhere else ten minutes ago.  Also, can we please hang a few signs like \"order here\", \"pick-up here,\" \"pay-here\" to direct traffic instead of the east coast \"If you don already know, then leave!\" attitude?"}
{"input": "I brought a party of 4 to dinner at 6. After sitting for 15 minutes seeking waitstaff,\nwe waited an interminable amount of time (40) minutes for a couple of salads. The appetizers were served with filthy dish-ware with food particles from the prior customer. The salads were less than delightfulwith crushed avacado slices thrown into the bowl as an afterthought. Needless to say the experience was eminently less than satisfactory.\nI will not ever return."}
{"input": "Massage: EXCELLENT!!!\n\nService: Professional and friendly. (Note: They have limited English speaking skill, so please be patient and understanding.) \n\nTherapist: Gina. She is a highly experienced massage therapist who practiced Tui Na and Shiatsu. \n\nIn case you're wondering what's their prices, since they don't have a website:  \n30mins = $39\n60mins = $49\n90mins = $79"}
{"input": "Pretty average bar/restaurant with the menu offerings you can expect from a place like this. The food was OK, and the service was excellent."}
{"input": "I have been coming to Cd Roma's for over 10 years. I love this place! The old locations was a bit more home style feeling and cozy and the new spot has a more modern vibe to it. I applaud the change in style with the change in times. Too many places get stuck doing the same thing over and over again. I am glad to see that the food is still delicious. The Chicken Parm, Eggplant Parm, house salad and Alfredo are some of my favorites and they have great pizza. The alfredo sauce is made to order and taste amazing with their breadsticks. Some appetizer items leave something to be desired like the frozen cheesesticks or calimari. I would love to see these replaced with better quality items. Overall, I still love this place and would choose it over Olive Garden any day. I do miss the homey old school vibe from the old location but I also miss the good old days when people talked to each other, fragglerock ruled and hip hop was Wu Tang Clan. Oh well...."}
{"input": "First stop on the trip and it was absolutely delicious! This would be my recommended spot for shrimp and grits every time! I can't say enough about their delicious food, friendly staff, and speedy service."}
{"input": "The breakfast menu and pastry menu changes so some visits I have liked more than others, but I love the way they do there menu, the overall quality is top notch. The food is funky and creative. I would not say its an every weekend brunch spot with the old reliable eggs florentine/pancakes but it is fun and I love coming here from time to time. Beware the line can get long but they have very good coffee and pastries to hold you over while you wait.\n\np.s. The restaurant vibes are great!"}
{"input": "I was here on the soft opening day (11/18). The official opening is on 11/21. Drinks were buy one get one. They were handshaking all the drinks so it took a while. Our order was after a big group one so it took 30 minutes to get our two orders. They are still working things out so it's understandable. \n\nThe boba here are are very unique. They are clear and jelly like in texture with a hint of something fruity. It was a refreshing change. They appear to specialize in foam milk teas. I ordered a standard boba milk tea, which is the equivalent of ordering chicken tenders and fries at a restaurant. It was okay but the boba made it worth it. My sister ordered a boba Sakura oolong tea without the foam. She enjoyed it very much and will be coming back. \n\nThe decor of this place is super cute and I would rate it the cutest bubble tea in Chinatown. The owner is also very friendly and nice."}
{"input": "Had great reviews. Tried someone new..my husbands cut looks great. My sons cut does not."}
{"input": "Haven't been here in years. Went here for first time in over a decade. Food still good. Pecan pancakes were delicious. My father enjoyed his breakfast lunch. Catfish dinner was still good. Fried up nice. Would return if in area. This is one of my favorite spots."}
{"input": "Service was GREAT! Food....meh. Jambalaya was almost room temperature and no okra at all. Won't be back."}
{"input": "I love the waxing method from EWC! Less pain, no irritation (I have sensitive skin) and they don't double dip the part that they spread the wax with. I usually go with Despina or Jenny."}
{"input": "I always enjoy a trip to TacoSon. They have good, authentic mexican cuisine. The building isn't much to look at, but it really is a diamond in the rough. Great, fast service and customizable menus make this a must visit lunch destination. If you do get the shredded beef tacos, make sure you eat them quick because those shells will get soggy and break apart on you. Still, you can just sop up the spill, it's all good."}
{"input": "They call a chicken salad sandwich two cubes of chicken with mayo in it and a salad with a salad that is a bowl Of lettuce a salad? Hmm left here hungry...."}
{"input": "Always loving this place..been coming there for more than 10 years...always had good service and good food,love their satay tofu and seafood scrambled egg chow fun...no one compares theirs..!!"}
{"input": "Can't say enough nice things about this place!  Reasonably priced and delicious options!  They have a gluten free bread that's pretty tasty so there are options for that! Love it!"}
{"input": "Omg this is sooooo good, the fried rice is gorgeous,   Good price good food, one of the best Asian restaurant on the town."}
{"input": "I will not return to this location. I contacted the manager in regards to a poorly made pizza I received, he replied to my online inquiry but never followed through on taking care of things. I even sent a photo to prove that the appearance of the pizza was not acceptable, and I never heard back from him."}
{"input": "I took my son here as a surprise yesterday because he is a big fan of lobster rolls. I had a Groupon coupon, and it was well worth the money. The lobster roll dint disappoint, though I'd like to try other menu items, as well. My son thoroughly enjoyed his lobster roll, too, so again, it was money well spent to see him pleased! The restaurant itself is a little short on space and ambiance. When we were there, they were slammed all at once, but the owner stepped in, apologized, got us seated, and took our order. He was humorous and kind, which took the edge off. I will visit again and this time, I'll try the steamed shrimp or crab legs... GIVE IT A TRY, ITZ WORTH IT!"}
{"input": "I grow up in Spain and now living in the USA. We were very excited about having an Spanish dinner at Nashville, well americano was ok but not perfect,it's free stile tapas nothing like in Spain,don't expect traditional Spanish food this is different but still good.wehad: patatas bravas totally worth it I recommend them, Brussels sprouts were delicious, sauté mushrooms were good but the portion was too small. And the the low part of the experience we ordered the Gambas al ajillo,which were not Gambas but another kind of shrimp and paying 9$ for 3 shrimps is a robber for real. We had also some chicken but it was not good. I give 4 stars because bravas, Brussels sprouts were great! I would come here again now that I know what to order. Service was nice and friendly!"}
{"input": "Amazing service,  food, menu and people.  Bacon pastry has no rival....  Simply amazing......"}
{"input": "A+++ service and accommodations. Food was delicious and came promptly. Servers were friendly and clean. A little pricey but we chose to eat on the pier, so we knew it ahead of time. Overheard a conversation with the manager and a patron where the manager was going out of his way to accommodate for the patron but the customer chose to leave instead. Great service we will come back every year."}
{"input": "If I could give negative stars I would. Terrible service. No one acknowledged me for over 10 minutes and that's only because I was leaving. The other customers told me don't bother ordering because I've been waiting over 30 minutes."}
{"input": "This is by far my favorite Chinese place to eat. And my 5 year old LOVES their sweet and sour chicken with lomein noodles."}
{"input": "Great staff. They really know their menu well. Pricing was very fair. My girlfriend and I enjoyed everything we ordered! Will return!"}
{"input": "I just paid $7 for .5oz of ahi tuna mixed with .5oz of avacado, romaine, and tomatoe. Grey goose martini was mostly dirty. Totally disappointed but I understand corporate training standards on drinks. Bartender was very nice, humorous. Also asked how my drink, as well as my food was on key. A+ on service. Totally cheap on food!"}
{"input": "Found this place online as I am traveling across country with my dog. I was assured it was dog friendly and that they would do \"and and everything to accomodate my dog.\" I dont expect much. I walked in the front entrance and had 2 servers walk within inches of me by the door and look at me as if i was in the way. I walked to the bar and a really friendly brunette bartender was super friendly. Thats the only high point. The server made it clear that we were a burden; 6 different staff members watched me wait for what i thought was a single person bathroom which turned out to be a 6 stall room. I even asked and they told me to wait. Ive worked in F&B for 16 years. I would fire the entire staff minus the one bartender (black hair, rasta tattoo on her shoulder, rasta necklace on; she was cool.) and get this place in shape. what a shame......not to mention the rare tuna panini was beyond well done; nothing like a canned tuna panini and shitty, rude service."}
{"input": "Great bar Happy Hour 4-7 every day. Wine & Drafts $3, $5 pizza, $4.50 apps. To-go Dinners and lunches are very reasonable and fast. Staff are as friendly as it gets."}
{"input": "Probably my least favorite thing I did in New Orleans. It was a boring boat tour with a guide that had the strangest accent. It felt like he was slurring through the entire two hour tour. Not very interesting insights either and it was so freaking hot on the boat I was just trying not to pass out from the heat and humidity. They stuff these boats to the brim and it's a total tourist trap. The water is brown and there is little to see. Much better off doing a swamp tour so you can at least see alligators and birds.  The one positive is they don't charge an arm and a leg for cold drinks which are an absolute must on this tour if you must go. So many other fun things to enjoy, I'd skip this one if I were you."}
{"input": "This place was awesome. Clean, beautiful and the food was outstanding. The staff was lovely, very attentive and accommodating. I brought my 11 month old there to meet a friend for lunch and we had a great time and a great meal. This is my new favorite joint."}
{"input": "I have been at this fantastic restaurant three times, each time the same old results..........superior quality, excellent service, and an atmosphere unlike any place in St. Louis..............if you want to have a romantic, fun, and very quality meal check out Modesto....."}
{"input": "This place might surpass me going to halal guys.Came in at 9:50, they close at 10; felt bad but this guy Jules was friendly throughout the whole ordeal, explained what I didn't know on the menu. Ordered the steak shwarma with rice with all the sauces. He even gave a sample of the Baba ganoush which was pretty good. The food however was.....ABSOLUTELY delicious!!! This had that healthy feel to it and was filling. Definitely coming back"}
{"input": "I think this Nordstrom's shoe department is better than other locations.  There was a lot of variety and they carry some higher end lines here.  The sales professionals were very good.  A gentleman named Erwin helped me locate two pairs of shoes throughout the Nordstrom's network AND price matched them to Bloomingdale's clearance sale price.  And no charge for shipping and handling.  Nordstrom's has won my loyalty due to the very high level of customer service!"}
{"input": "Tried this place out with a coworker for lunch and loved it. The setting is modern, rustic and comfortable. Tables offer decent privacy and sitting at the bar you have a front row seat to the kitchen and can watch your meal being prepared. The feed is flavorful and fresh! I had the chicken schwarma with lamb bacon. I substituted lettuce for the alfalfa sprouts and it was delicious! I also tried the crispy beets, they were good though surprisingly a little spicy. I love spice so it was a pleasant surprise for me. My coworker had the burger which looked heavenly, he also had the sweet potatoes topped with sweet potato chips. I tried it and immediately had food envy. I'll be getting that next time. Definitely recommend, two thumbs up."}
{"input": "The guy was super nice and attentive and told me what would go good on my white sauce pizza, I listened to him and my pizza was great!! I went with friends and we all got something different and all taste tested each others food and all of it was tasty. Definitely will be going back. We also got the free pesto breadsticks, yum! Their marinara is delicious!!"}
{"input": "Great service and food!! The portion sizes were perfect!  Will definitely be back"}
{"input": "Their prices are standard for salons in the Manayunk area.  It is usually pretty easy to get an appointment.  I never really had a bad haircut although I never do anything crazy with my hair either.  The space is very open and clean with friendly staff everywhere.  My only gripe is that there seems to be a high turnover with their stylists.  I only had the same stylist twice.  They do send a discount in the mail to apologize for the inconvenience."}
{"input": "They say the 3rd times the charm,not here. Maybe it's just the evening crew,I don't know. This was my 3rd and last time(not charmed). For the 3rd time my order was incorrect,burger was very greasy,bun was cold and so were my fries. However the coke was great. Not up for another try. Skip it!"}
{"input": "I walked all the way up Magazine St. to get here, sure I could have taken the bus but where is the fun in that? I wanted to go slow and enjoy it, which I did. I had credit from my local Buffalo Exchange so I figured I might as well try and spend it here.  I found a vintage Los Angles (Yes, in NOLA) graphic shirt which is very cool, I wear it regulary. I also traded in a shirt and chatted with friendly person at the counter about DIY shoe repair which is a hobby of mine. I will be back next time I visit."}
{"input": "WOW! We love this place, always clean and waited on hand and foot. Love to play the slots and eat and its all great. The rooms are always the best in Reno. Thank you Peppermill love everything about you!"}
{"input": "I am from WA state and was in town visiting my sister the week of Thanksgiving. She scheduled us hair appointments with Ally W.  I was very nervous because I hadn't colored my hair in 7 years(it was just a very boring brown color) ;) I have hard water and didn't want my water to change the colors. I explained to her kind of what I wanted (blonde highlights) then told her about my hard water. She said she had a plan for me and would love to do caramel since my water is so hard. I let her do what she thought was best (usually I wouldn't), but she seemed to know what she was talking about and was VERY VERY confident in her job. I trusted her and walked out of the salon feeling fabulous. She did such an amazing job and I have never gotten so many compliments on my hair.  I love the confidence that she had and she was so personable. If I lived closer I would go back in a heartbeat. The next time I come and visit I will definitely be making another appointment with her. Thank you again Ally. \nCarrie"}
{"input": "I have to agree with John N.  This was probably the least friendly and least efficient Subway I have ever experienced.  I'm not sure if the employee's dogs had all just died, or what the deal was, but they barely said 'hi' and barely made eye contact.  \n\nI have been to many great Subways in my day.  This is certainly not one of them.  They get two stars only because my sandwich was good.  But when there is a Subway on nearly every street around Vandy, you better believe I won't be coming back to this one."}
{"input": "First off... Tampa has really impressed me with how many Thai restaurants there are.  2nd off... Jasmine Thai is really yummy!\n\nIt's cozy and casual, but still pretty!  The decorations are awesome, and the tables are really elaborately done.  I was impressed.\n\nThe food was authentic and the service was great.  \n\nThere's not much more that I can say."}
{"input": "Is it worth waiting in line for? Probably not. \nLife-changing? No. \nBut if there's no real wait, and you've got nothing else planned that afternoon and can take the siesta necessary to digest all the carbs, you should go. The sweet potato pancakes are really good, but if you're looking for something less sweet, more savory, order the cornmeal cakes. If you want an omlet, head next door to Jackson's."}
{"input": "My husband and I tried the restaurant for our anniversary. It was new to me but not to my husband, while I love trying new places with a relaxing adult atmosphere; the food appeared to a little salty, the paring of the appetizer (bread) was odd. However, will try the place again; and would recommend to others."}
{"input": "My fiancée and I went to lunch on MLK Jr day around 1pm.  It wasn't busy so we expected the service to be excellent and to my surprise it wasn't.  The hostess was less than excited to greet us with barely a smile and such a low voice we could hardly understand her.  After we sat, it took our server about 10 minutes to greet us, although he was apologetic and cheery.  It then took another 6-7 mins to bring our drinks, one beer and water.  The good was far below par.  My jalepeno shooters were luke warm at best.  My half pound burger was average and her special sirloin lacked any seasoning.  All I can say is that I'm glad we had a gift card from Christmas we used because I would've asked to speak to a manager...which I didn't notice one at all patrolling the floor.  Maybe in the future we will try again but most likely at a different location!!"}
{"input": "My wife and I have been to Peggs many times and have always enjoyed it, the pizza and wings never fail to please. They also have a very good Philly style sandwich ,and some tasty salads. The service has always been friendly and courteous.  I do feel that the size of the wings has decreased lately. \n  We like to arrive and eat early, because although I like the idea of family restaurants , it does get very loud , due to lack of acoustics , and pretty hectic once the families start to arrive for dinner hour. \n  That being said we always enjoy our meal at Peggs."}
{"input": "Good deal if you get the large order for like 35 dollars. Definitely worth splitting among your friends"}
{"input": "Food was excellent but when asked to honor their yelp offer of 10% off our bill for checking in and reviewing their business, We were told that they would not honor the deal until our next visit even though the yelp countdown said we had 4 hours to redeem the deal. Great food, but bad business practice :("}
{"input": "Great ambiance, good service and the food is delicious!"}

{"input": "The line can be intimidating, but moves pretty fast. The pancakes are the bomb. I love pancakes I thought it was worth it. I went on a busy Saturday and my group of 5 waited in line, sat down and finished our food in maybe less than 2 hours, probably less than that. The coffee wasn't great, but lets be honest I was there for the chocolate chip pancakes."}
{"input": "So Chad was a douche but we loved joe. He made our visit awesome and also he told us the door wasn't working so we decided to drunk the phenomenal beer and go in through the enter. The girl in met p, Carly, would have been pissed. But it's ok I drank her tears!!!!!"}
{"input": "So I called and placed an order over the phone with pizza huts apparent call center. the little girl who sounded all of seventeen was very unprofessional no phone experience she messed up my order and put me on hold whole she had a side bar conversation about her friend finally showing up for work.  I say this because when I got there it was a all male crew! My order was wrong the lady had relayed a totally different order. The poor guy at pizza hut making pizza was so frustrated no his fault I totally understood at this point. He apologized and told me he would re make it right now correctly such a respectable man. Something between who takes the call somewhere else and who relays to the establishment has a disconnect. Annoying to have to drive all the way back!"}
{"input": "Went out for a late dinner in a city we did not know very well, after a few blocks saw this very nice looking restaurant in a area with many bars but weren't in the mood for bar food...meatball app was great so was the gravy that came with it, the caponata was good too and burrata just needed some seasoning.\n\nOrdered personal pizzas a margherita and then a clam/bacon but said panchetta on menu they both tastes great hot! But one cooled back at the hotel room tasted bad for some reason.\n\nAs a side ordered broccoli rabe which cost 6 bucks but the serving size looked like a 3 buck suggestion, the rabe was not bitter at all the freshest i'ver eaten prepared in oil and garlic just a bit too much red pepper flakes...but still damn good"}
{"input": "not impressed!..... the service was great but the pizza i ordered was not good. i love Stella and Trenos pizza so i wast expecting the same type. no desire to return again"}
{"input": "The food is great and so are the strawberry mojitos my favorite but , the service suck. My waiter took forever to come to check on us. We waited to get our check 20 minutes."}
{"input": "My go to ramen place in town! You'd think you were ordering ramen on the street in Korea or Japan! It's that good. Try to get there before 2 to get a seat reservation. Tends to fill up fast, due to it being in Sam Hughes area and close to the UofA. Worth going and trying then all. Chopsticks use are recommended otherwise you'll get stares for using a fork or spoon here!"}
{"input": "I can grant them that this is the busiest time of the year. Not my choice to move at this time, work directed. - but their consumer service takes piss poor to a new level. Instead of providing name of driver and #, all I get is he will arrive between 8-10 in the morning. Awesome! Quite possibly one of the hottest days of the year here (StL) and they may or may not start loading the truck until 10? Okey dokie. \n\nAnd the delivery window is five to eleven days. All of their paper work states I asked for early delivery. I did NOT! Then the kid on the phone says easy enough to drive 2200 miles by Monday. Truck may or may not leave on Wednesday or Thursday. How dare you tell me how far I can or will drive."}
{"input": "We've been coming here since I was a kid. The staff has watched me and now my kids grow up. They're personable and so nice. They're also very prompt with service. Yoli and frank are the absolute best! The food is amazing! I absolutely love their shredded beef burro and cheese crisp. I feel they have true authentic Mexican food."}
{"input": "Amazing dinner.  What a unique menu.  The service was top notch.  Adrian was our server and she was a delight.  I had the endive and beet salad - lovely.  And then the tongue.  Not what my grandmother made and that's okay.  This was spectacular.  Good wine list and yummy dessert.  The meal was wonderful and I'll be back next time I'm in town.  Bravo!!!"}
{"input": "Price is intimidating but worth it! \nOwner is an awesome human. \nBartender was fantastic!"}
{"input": "Just what Donelson needed! I am so happy this place opened up in the neighborhood! Their version of huevos rancheros is so freaking amazing! And their Baja fish tacos are bomb! I've only been twice so far but both times have been such a delight! Honestly I feel like this place is really boosting the popularity of Donelson! We are more than just a farmers market! Thank you Nectar!!!!"}
{"input": "Best nail salon I have been EVER. Very professional staff, super clean and great nails. I found something very odd on yelp, down below the reviews there is a link that writes '6 other reviews that are not currently recommended' but if you click on it all reviews are super great, no such thing as not currently recommended! Also you will notice that the stars are not red, they are tinted gray!!! In any case, Glossy nails is creating a good reputation. Keep up the good work ;-)"}

{"input": "I've been going back and forth for a while trying to decide how to describe how wonderful Elm is. Let me just say, I am always over the top satisfied every time I am there. \n\nI would recommend trying coffee, soup, and a sandwich to get an idea of how great they are!"}
{"input": "They sat us within 5 minutes and then took 40 minutes to even bring out sodas. The table next to us had the same server and got their good before their beverages came out. After almost an hour there with no drinks we tracked down a manager who told us our good never even got entered. I'm on my honeymoon and the friend we were there with had a date to make. Appetizer was the only thing to make it out and was decent boneless wings. Even with the manager begging us to let her get our food together free and not walk out, the service was beyond dismal and slow. First and last time coming to a Beef's. Made us all late. If we had waited at our table for the food we would have made our year anniversary before it came out. Better choices for food elsewhere. Avoid this place at all costs"}
{"input": "Pretty good place it only gets 4 stars because I like the one in carrollwood better that is the best one. But living over in south Tampa now I don't go to carrollwood anymore so this place will do. I like brick oven pizza and they make a better brick oven than grammandis ."}
{"input": "This was our first visit. We were greeted warmly and given a great table. The menus is really nice, with excellent specials. Our food was awesome! Crescenzo was superb! So charming! We will definitely be back and suggest to others."}

{"input": "Loved the abvionce.. got pampered and relaxed. It was hard to get a drink order place. Was the only reason I did not give them a 5. Had to ask 4 people before I was told to go call roommservice on the white phone."}
{"input": "I found this little gem while passing through TN to see family during a move. \nLOVED IT!! \n\n1. I'm a greater Seattle area girl at heart, so I love finding these little drive-up coffee stands. No matter where I'm at, if I spot one I have to try it out. In Hendersonville you will not find better coffee than this place. \n\n2. Manual machines. If you really appreciate espresso, then you'll appreciate the importance of what a manual espresso machine does for the taste of your drink. \n\n3. Great location. On a main strip, easy to get in and out of.\n\n4. Double-sided drive up windows. And no call/order box. The best coffee stands put you face to face with your barista right from the start.\n\n5. After coming here twice, the OWNER had me (an out-of-towner) and my drink memorized. \n\nIf you love GREAT coffee, don't pass this place up."}
{"input": "Jessica C. was Super Helpful, it's a Huge & Busy Store, \ni can't even tell how much she helped this newbie\non the South East corner across from the Speedwasy Shopping Mall, across the street from Marsh & also directly across from KFC"}
{"input": "Food here is mediocre, not great and not that bad. The pad thai had too much carrots mixed in with it, imo. My pineapple fried rice was ok. Boyfriend's spicy noodles were ok as well. I am visiting from San Francisco where there are a ton of excellent Thai restaurants so I can be a bit picky. I suppose this is good enough for Santa Barbara. Maybe go here if you are really craving Thai, but pass if you are looking for a memorable meal."}
{"input": "Stopped in for a really late lunch!! My brother told me if I am ever in hudson i should stop by, so I did, I had a job in Hudson at the end if the day. Was a great idea. Got right in no waiting. Ordered the blackened Mahi Mahi sandwich,  it came pretty quick. Looked good & sure was! The sandwich was worth the stop, the fries were good too! Where I was sitting i had a fantastic view of the Gulf. It was filling also. The atmosphere was good, the waitress did a good job."}
{"input": "Just fair.  Trout was good but not hot when it arrived at the table. Others had the corn chowder, burger, and chicken.  No complaints but not good enough to bring us back. Service was fair - food came slowly but it was Saturday night. The acoustics are poor."}
{"input": "This is a quiet quaint place hidden from the traffic. Madre is a clean modern looking restaurant. Tacos are the main food. Sandwichs, guaq and chips, beer and other drinks are available also. My wife had the Ensinada fish taco ( Baja style grilled). I had the Idaho Potato and chorizo, and mushroom tacos.  All were superb and unique with sauces and ingredients. I will gladly go there again and enjoy the quiet atmosphere and great food. Service was fantastic also."}
{"input": "I just popped in here to check out the new spot. I love the lighting and the size.  Looks like they have a yummy menu of food items, and great selection of cocktails.  $40 for 1-hour of unlimited bowling is a great deal.  The only thing that threw my off is the $10 cover charge to get it.  I'm not exactly sure what time this begins, I'm thinking around 8?  But I didn't realize this was a club.  It looks more like a sports bar, so I don't understand the reason for charging to get in.  I will for sure not go in there when there is a cover, it's not worth it to me.  Plenty of other spots around town that don't charge to get in.  If I'm going to pay for a club, I'm going to go to a club.\nLooking forward to going on an afternoon and bowling."}
{"input": "Awesome food and beer, best craft beer in Tucson! The tequila cilantro wings are a must with a Barrio Blonde."}
{"input": "One of the worst experiences I have had at this place , poor cut , undercooked, mushrooms were terrible tasting . Sent  steak back for a new one I thought, same grizzly piece came back burnt looking , offered a new steal at that point , but I had enough waiting for them to get it right. . Off to get something to eat elsewhere."}
{"input": "These donuts were amazing, nothing negative I have to say about this place. I was a little sad that they didn't have my strawberry donut I was looking forward to very much. & I did get a bit of a hard time about wanting a chicken sandwich with a glazed donut, being told they couldn't do that, but hey I ended up with a chicken glazed donut sandwich which I really appreciated after being told they couldn't do. The staff was very kind and I loved walking in back to use the restroom & seeing the huge deep fryer full of their freshly made donuts!! Biting into one of their donuts was nice because they're so freaking delicate they almost melt when you eat them!!!! The texture was amazing and the chicken was even a good quality. I was very impressed & I will never look at Krispy Kreme the same"}
{"input": "Good food, fresh and you can taste the quality. Good service as well. Went here at 7:30 on a Saturday night and walked right in. Was pretty dead but probably because there's so much going on in the city, State Fair, Symphony on the Prairie, etc. Had the Charleston BLT, which is a crab cake BLT. Crabcake was huge, all meat, and tasted house made. Spinach and artichoke dip was good as well. Easy parking."}
{"input": "Love the Fried Chicken there but have you tried Joe Bob's Baby Back Ribs? We travel a lot and I have to say that after the Stake Out's rib in Las Vegas, these ribs are the second best we have eaten anywhere in Nevada. Super tender, juicy, and very meaty with a mild but great tasting sauce. Unlike some other's ribs, these have a nice smoked flavor even before the BBQ sauce is added. \n\nNice local pub atmosphere with a few slots and sports orientated TV's. Smoke free too."}
{"input": "There was four of us and a 2 year old. So you can imagine how many times we called the server to our table. And I'll tell you what, Bill our server was excellent. He was extremely patient, fun and provided great service. We all enjoyed our meals, the food was great. We would definitely go back!"}
{"input": "I had take out from here tonight so this review is solely the food. My first time here even though I live around the corner. I ordered the Buffalo chicken salad with romaine letteus and blue cheese dressing. It was amazing! Greens were fresh and crispy, blue cheese dressing not full of chunks, and chicken delicious. I will definitly be going back for this salad."}
{"input": "The pharmacist is incredibly helpful. When my insurance would not cover the cost of a compound prescription, she researched the issue and was able to recommend a different way of formulating the compound so it would be covered by my insurance.  Excellent customer service!"}
{"input": "not many great bars in soco but this comes close.  lots of tvs, good atmosphere. we didn't eat but I'd definitely try the food.  overall a good time."}
{"input": "If you beat the crowd you're in. Small but that's the only negative. Everything I've tried on the menu is AMAZING! They even have vegetarian/vegan items. I always get whatever french toast special they have. I always take people who stay with me for Mardi Gras here for breakfast before we hit the parades."}
{"input": "Highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for some good Indian cuisine! Great service to top it off; will federal be back here whenever I am in the Phili area!"}
{"input": "Great spot for Sunday brunch. We were sat immediately, which is always a positive. The servers were extremely polite and kind. Our drinks were delicious and the food was great. \nI personally ordered the Petite Filet with the truffle scrambled eggs, was the perfect portion. My fiancé ordered their famous BBQ shrimp, very tasty but were a tad over cooked, was very difficult to remove the shells. When we mentioned it to our server she was very nice and even offered a complimentary dessert. Also ordered at the table were the Eggs Benedict and the Fried Oyster Sliders, they were also enjoyed very much. A tad expensive for breakfast but it was all very good. \nTo finish our meal we ordered the Bread Pudding....amazing, also the White Chocolate Brownie was very good!! Overall a great experience. \n\nKeep in mind they also have live music for Sunday brunch!"}
{"input": "Great gelateria on Grand. Also a cafe, but did not try their coffee. Nice cozy atmosphere, cute patio, and friendly service.\n\nThe salty caramel is out of this world. Being a connoisseur of this flavor, I would even go so far as to say it is possibly the best salty caramel flavor iced dessert concoction that I have ever had. The pistachio, raspberry, and lemon are also pretty darn good.\n\nThey set up with their gelato cart at Tower Grove Farmers market Saturday mornings. I am pretty sure that gelato is an acceptable breakfast food, especially on a hot summer day.\n\nAlso, they have Cheerwine and Sun Drop, which I've never seen outside of the Carolinas!"}
{"input": "Whenever I feel like eating pizza and wings, I get this delivered. Love the pizza as it doesn't taste like it was dough defrosted and baked with frozen toppings. The hot wings are delicious and they have a nitro option I've only had once (they are too hot for me but still taste good). This place is like the neighborhood pizzaria that everyone wishes they had. It's a little pricey but worth it. I give 4 stars because the bbq wings have a funky aftertaste."}
{"input": "Such an awesome place to get cocktails! Yes, the drinks are a bit pricey (to me at least), but even the glassware is cool and designs you've rarely seen. The cocktails are delicious- Dragon's Tear, Blackmail and I'm sure I had a third. My friends couldn't get enough either. \n\nThe music fits just perfectly with the laid back, mix-matched decor. I wasn't nuts about their choice of food, but for drinks I'll definitely be back."}
{"input": "We stayed at the intercontinental during our visit and this place was a no brainer in terms of the proximity to our hotel and the reviews. We dragged our hungover asses out of bed and walked in here with hopes of eating some delicious food and a well needed dose of caffeine. We each got started with coffee, which was absolutely fantastic. I ordered the southern breakfast and requested toast instead of sausage, while my friends ordered the soft shell crab and crab omelet. I loved the food I ordered.. except everything lacked a little seasoning. Also, the bacon was completely dry. I love bacon in any shape or form, so I didn't seem to mind the lack of grease. The jalapeno grits were spectacular and so was the biscuit. My friends seemed to really enjoy their breakfast as well. The fries again, lacked seasoning which seemed odd. How does one forget to add salt to fries? We were too hungover to notice or care.. Overall, its a pretty good place if you're looking for decent French food."}
{"input": "For pick up tonight I ordered the margarita pizza *added garlic and mushrooms to it and ordered the clam chowder. My favorite is thin crust pizza which this is and crispy. Both very very delicious!"}
{"input": "Doesn't look like much from the outside, but they have good food and decent service, plus they deliver in the T&C area."}
{"input": "I have had several meals and each and every one was exceptional.  From the very creative appetizers, salads, main courses and homemade desserts, it was a culinary adventure.  The Menu features everything from shrimp and grits to ravioli.  I found out recently that they were named \"Best New Restaurant on the Main Line by Main Line Magazine\".  Also, it's great that they have BYOB."}
{"input": "Very cute & cozy decor. Upscale but still casual. The food was all very good. We ate brunch. Will be back to try lunch or dinner."}
{"input": "I went on the Paradise ship to Cozumel, Mexico. I enjoyed everything from the food, to the cruise director, Calvyn. Our housekeeping person, Sean, was the best, and he knew our names on the first day. I definitely recommend this cruise line, they do a great job at keeping the activities fresh, and there is never a dull moment. I wish I could give it more stars but I can't!"}
{"input": "This was not the best hotel I've ever stayed at.  But it certainly wasn't the worst.  We were there during the week, and found the accommodations perfectly acceptable.\n\nThe beds were a little firm for my taste, but we were able to get a two-room suite for under $200 a night on (upper) State St. in Santa Barbara, which is not bad, especially in summer. It's not pretty or fancy, but the TV works and it was pretty quiet\n\nWe would return again."}
{"input": "Been training at Paragon since 2012. I was hooked since I first stepped on the mat. The top quality instruction makes me want to keep learning and progressing. Franjinha, Sean, and the rest of the instructors are always easy to come to with questions. The good friends I've made here motivate me keep coming to the gym, it definitely creates an awesome family environment to be apart of. Plus, the staff runs a clean/well-organized gym and they're always friendly and welcoming to anyone who walks in the door."}
{"input": "Cute place. But lame liquor selection and the pizza by the slice served at 10pm on a thurs was old and burnt. Good bartender. Overall, should be upping their game big time if they're going to be an off-the-beaten path bar right downtown. Beer selection was decent. Overall, not very impressed and probably won't be back unless I have to."}
{"input": "This place is a hidden gem.  The food here is a bit trendy but very well prepared.  The drink menu has original drinks from their bar.  I found the atmosphere very relaxing.  I would highly recommend you check this place out.  It's not cheap but I  found my meal worth the money and I am looking forward to returning for another. meal."}
{"input": "Bummer, just moved to this area and this was my first visit to this location.  I didn't receive my change or receipt,  it was just change but I asked for it and she said she gave it to me, um no. Was in a hurry so I didn't wanna argue.  And no spoon for my chili. Cheese on my burger was old, which means my burger wasn't freshly made. Tasted ok but won't return."}
{"input": "So happy my trainer turned me on to this place.   I walked in feeling terrible about myself and left feeling motivated and excited.  The products are amazing and Anna is extremely knowledgable.   Everyone there is friendly and motivating..."}
{"input": "Great spot. Spicy here is spicy... be careful... but definitely enjoyed the spicy fish. We also did the fried wontons, good but nothing crazy special, and a rice noodle dish with pork. All was delicious. There were six in our party and the bill was 42 bucks. We brought a couple bottles of wine and after tip had a great authentic dinner for under 10 bucks each.\n\nMost importantly the service was great.  Accomodating the two vegetarians in our group was only possible with the waiters help. They also were able to seat us, as they asked another party of three to move to a smaller table so two tables could be put together. \n\nA great experience for our entire party."}
{"input": "Not sure where all the love has gone, cus this is a great place to eat! The food is nice and yummy, and so are the drinks! \n\nDon't be surprised if you order a couple drinks and entrees and your bill is closer to 100$ for two, but it's worth the price...top to bottom the food has always been a delight...except the shoe string fries...they are a side to be avoided...they are too thin a cut of potato...otherwise, a nice place and good place to eat :-)\n\nIf you are looking to save a few dollars, go for happy hour and sit at the bar...they have good deals for happy hour!"}
{"input": "Great dinner started with a wonderful fresh Caesar salad and bread followed by delicious cheese ravioli with pesto cream sauce. The pesto sauce was perfect, not overpowering the delicate pasta. I also enjoyed the Dunham cabernet. Delicious. Welcome to downtown, Richard's."}
{"input": "MMMMMMMM.\nThe place is slowly starting to get more crowded, but I'm enjoying my slightly empty sunday dinners.  Really great service, the people there know their stuff and I've seen them guide people through picking a beer and food.\nTheir daily burger and grilled cheese specials are awesome and they've just added some new items like tortillas and salsa that are really good too. Brunch is rather new too.... but good! Love it here."}
{"input": "Very fresh food- they actually make their own stuff! We ate lunch at the bar and the bartender went out of his way to help my husband find a good gluten free option. \n\nI ordered the black bean burger and it was delicious! Great atmosphere as well. Definitely recommend this place as there are not all that many fresh and relatively healthy places in the area. Wish we had found it sooner!"}
{"input": "We know PJ's from other locations. We welcomed it to Oaks. It has a wide range of good bar type food. Sports bar atmosphere. This store is for a younger sports loving crowd. Their wine list is tiny which limits older guests. Don't sit at the bar as the service with 2 exceptions is inattentive at best. Great salads. Wide range of sandwiches. Happy Hour choices limited but still very crowded."}
{"input": "Although the term is often overused, \"farm fresh\" truly applies here. Inventive, flavorful dishes and just-right portions amaze. A cozy dining room, friendly atmosphere and attentive service make it the perfect setting to catch up with friends and loved ones (BYO, so grab a good bottle). Try the Bloody Beet Steak!"}
{"input": "disappointed that they wouldn't fill my dogfish head growlers and the beer itself wasn't memorable."}
{"input": "As an update to my previous review, we had tried the pizza tonight and it was delicious. The   crust is light, thin and tasty. The sauce is sweet and spicy. Mozzarella and provolone is the perfect combination of cheese. Just add those amazing meatballs and you have a wonderful pie!"}
{"input": "Love this place. Great sandwiches at a great price. I've yet to (m)eat a sandwich here that i didn't like. They have a different special each day, and those are always a good option. Wednesday see's the \"Aporkalypse\" rolled out and it is fantastic. I love their reuben, especially when i go for the large size, but it makes it hard to get any work done for the rest of the day.They also have a great chip selection, if the sandwich is not enough. \n\nDespite the long line that is often snaking around the outside, it moves really quickly so don't leave! Service is friendly and efficient and the decor is unique. The live jazz/blues on a Saturday might be popular but i'm not a fan. Just way too loud and crowded. This Benton Park gem is a must for your next lunch break."}
{"input": "I walked in at 9:30 on a Tuesday and the owner told me they were closed. They need to change the hours online and lock the doors when they're closed."}
{"input": "Not sure how to review this place fairly. The effort on the part of the owners is top notch--love how the order process follows you to the table so any follow up dishes you might want don't require waiting in the front line again. However, the culinary execution failed somehow, or at least it fell strangely flat. While all the food we had (beef souvlaki, lamb pita, and grilled octopus) was decent, it definitely wasn't transcendent. It was just food. Also, the ubiquitous french fries were only semi-addictive as were a  little dry. \n\nWhile this is maybe the best Greek food in Nashville, that in itself doesn't warrant 5 stars. What we concluded after eating all the food was, while Greko was \"okay\" there was nothing that we had that would draw us back."}
{"input": "When I ate here I chose something a little off compared to the other things on the menu. Unfortunately my sense of trying something new was unsuccessful because I didn't really like the meal. Every pasta I had tasted dry to me, like it needed more sauce. But the environment there is perfect and you feel amazing . Just wish they could work on the food a bit."}
{"input": "Best WalMart on the southside. Nice location. If you're looking for a southside WalMart, this is the one to visit.\n\nProduce tends to be good and fresh because they move a high volume. The produce selection is not great for unusual stuff, but the basics are fresh."}
{"input": "This place is pretty lame. Band was average. Cover was too high ($10) and the owner or whoever was running the show was kind of a dick and the food out of the accompanying bbq joint was pretty shitty. The owner or manager is currently being an asshole to another member of my party as we try to leave."}
{"input": "Exactly what you want a dive bar to be. I'm lucky to have graced its presence. In town with a world traveling band and couldn't have been a better atmosphere."}
{"input": "Terrible! Rude service, and very dirty. Floors had trash on them. The bathroom that I used had water (or some other substance) on the floor. \nI was pregnant and taking the glucose tolerance test which takes a long time. I had to use the bathroom often. I was scolded for using the bathroom because the water was turned off which they apparently do during a urine drug test. I had no idea...and then I couldn't flush the toilet or wash my hands. I wasn't even offered to use another sink. Ridiculous!"}
{"input": "These folks are great... kept me in the loop as they progressed on a tag transfer, pleasant to deal with and reasonably priced for their services. I highly recommend them."}
{"input": "Exactly what I was looking for. Got the fried chicken,  mashed with gravy, biscuits. Huge portion , excellent service, very fair price. Will definitely be back."}
{"input": "We are visiting from Indiana for the month. It was time for my daughter to  go back to Indiana and I discovered this place through Yelp. When we got to The Three Coins Diner we thought oh my. Are we going to be safe in this neighborhood and what kind of food are we going to get?\n\nWe entered the restaurant and we were told to seat ourselves. We looked at the menu and the prices were very reasonable. We ordered our meals.  Our meals were huge! My daughter had french toast and fruit. The fruit bowl was huge! My son had the country fried steak and eggs. I had 2 eggs, 4 pieces of bacon and 2 pancakes.  The food was great and so was the waitress. Our waitress kept coming up and asking if we wanted anything else. We haven't had service like that in a long time.  We will be coming back to this restaurant for sure!!!!"}
{"input": "No complaints here. Mom and Pops style diner with good traditional breakfast. Restaurant was small so was worried it would be busy but was pretty dead when we walked in. The service was quick and the food came out hot and fast. I orderd the farmers omlet which had ham, bacon, sausage, and potatoes. It also came with a large portion hash browns that were just as good! I would definitely recommend this late night breakfast joint!"}
{"input": "Great weekday buffet ! Mattar paneer was off the hook!"}
{"input": "I went in today because of neck and shoulder pain. Marisa was awesome. I've never experienced a massage like this before. She did a deep tissue massage and stretched my body as well. I already feel better and it's 5 hours later. I'm definitely going back to her soon!"}
{"input": "OMG I just left this place an hour ago and I'm considering pressing charges !! I walked in about 30 mins before closing i simply went In asking for their price for a fill the lady said $18 && if I waited 5 mins they can do them tonight ! The lady who does the fills claimed her name was \" Tracy \" seemed mad she didn't even say hello then she started arguing with her coworker and during their argument she pulled my arm and twisted my hand i seriously wanted to cry !! She also cut me !! My fill looks horrible ! She was very  rude !! They ended up charging me $24 how ?? Idk never going there again !! I will be calling them tomorrow for a full refund or I will press charges after all she knows she messed up because after she pulled my arm she said \" sorry \" and kept arguing !!  I was the last one there and when my nails were done she just said \"ok bye \" no thank you for coming or legit  Apology !!"}
{"input": "I needed a last minute carpet replacement and R&N came through.  Rob came to the house to measure the room, explained everything in detail, didn't try to upsell/pressure me, and charged a fair price.  Then him and his guys came in the next day, texted with timely updates, and put in the carpet as requested.  R&N made it easy during a stressful time and that is awesome in my book.  Highly recommend."}
{"input": "First of all this is a music lover's mecca.  I cannot say enough good things about Preservation Hall.  We showed up as recommended 45min before they opened the doors and were about 10th in line, sat in the first row of benches and proceeded to have the best time over the next three sets.  Having read that they don't serve food, drink, or have bathrooms I packed a little bag with some of Zapp's and a beer.  \n\nThis is the only venue in New Orleans where music wasn't blasted at us from speakers...there are no amps, mics, or ringing in the ears, just pure and simple jazz.  \n\nMy only regret is not having come here every night of our stay."}
{"input": "Honestly the food doesn't knock my socks off but other people seem to love this place. I go because my husband likes it as for me I'd rather go to a different BBQ spot. I guess it also depends on what you order."}
{"input": "Go here and get a burger.  Get the King Burger and the Village Whiskey Burger.  Also get some pickles and eat your face off.  I like going here and just stuffing my face and enjoying every minute of it.  From the duck fries to the deviled eggs - order, eat, and enjoy.  Just go and eat and savor.  Yeah your gonna pay but it is worth it."}
{"input": "First know that the shop works by appointment only.   Don't find out the hard way like I did.  Even though I arrived while Jack was there he told me both that he closes at 5 and works by appointment only.  I guess he has more customers than he needs.  I won't be one of them."}
{"input": "Penca looks like it was plucked straight out of Bushwick, Brooklyn. Hardwood paneling, fancy cocktails, Edison light bulbs, bow ties and facial hair all belie the strong Mexican bent on the menu (Mexico City cuisine, to be precise) and the Tucson prices. While the hostess was a little green, the rest of the staff was warm, and very knowledgable (\"penca\" is the name for the shoots of the agave plant). The drinks are expertly mixed and the food looked great."}
{"input": "Really good Pho! \n\nLike, really good Pho. \n\nThe Thai Coffee is on point ... and bubble tea... oh, yeah... fantastic bubble tea!"}
{"input": "This is like a high class Benihana's.  The food was excellent, the service was professional and entertaining.  Great place for a first date or with a big group of friends.  I had a business dinner there, which brought our group closer together (I thought).  They also serve sushi so don't think you have to grill it up.  This place is a must try!"}
{"input": "I'm in no way a pho pro, but I liked Saigon Deli better than this one, but those who are looking for Pho, that place is not open in the evenings, at least I do not believe so.  The spring rolls here are smaller, there is definitely a lot less meat in the vermecilli noodles dishes, and the seasoning was not as tasty in my opinion.\nI'm glad I also tried something different, the sweet and sour fish, it was pretty good but I think after a while the taste would be pretty strong.  I did really like the veggies in the dish though.\nI couldn't stop thinking about the other place. The flavor, the sizes for the price, and the service at the other place was much better than my experience at Pho An Hoa."}
{"input": "Forget The Company Burger - THIS is the best burger in New Orleans! I hadn't been here since it changed owners (and names), but I went tonight for the first time in over 5 years and was not disappointed. My only minor complaint is that they changed the bun since the last time I ate here. Other than that, this is still by far the best burger I've ever had. Period."}
{"input": "I went In For a diagnostic. Told the issue (that is unrelated to this post)....afterwards my car would not start. So the mechanic put my car in neutral ....not drive....and then it started. It did not do that to begin with.....so when I got home it would not park!!!! And I didn't go for that problem at all!!!!!"}
{"input": "Honestly haven't left a place more disappointed in my life. The service was terrible from the start. The servers were very rude and extremely slow. It almost seemed like they were all extremely hungover or just stupid. After waiting for 15 minutes with absolutely no service we ended up walking out. I hear the beer is good though."}
{"input": "Oh, SATCO.  You're not the best taco shop but you do have your moments.\n\nI come to SATCO for:\n\n1.  An inexpensive lunch.\n2.  Queso\n3.  Outside seating with music loud enough to drown out thoughts of my To Do List.\n4.  Great for groups.\n5.  Cheap beer.\n\nWhat I don't come to SATCO for:\n\n1.  Authentic Mexican food.\n2.  A quiet lunch.\n3.  A Vandy student-free lunch.\n4.  Their guacamole dip.\n\nYep, that about sums it up!"}
{"input": "Love this place come here everyone I'm in this area. I had a veg plate and all items were wonderful. The deviled eggs are good but the German Chocolate Cake is to die for!!!!!"}
{"input": "I had an awesome experience at Champs today. I told the groomer how I wanted Harley's haircut and she did it exactly as requested. And it looked fabulous. In addition, the groomer, manager, and Pat all courteous and helpful. I also had the opportunity to see the dogs out back during our playtime. Backyard is so big they have more than enough space to run around and have fun. I would highly recommend them for grooming and boarding. And I look forward to seeing them again."}
{"input": "Great surprise sushi place. The miso soup was the best we have ever had, the house salad was actually good. I ordered Dinner Box A which came with four different items which three were fantastic and the steak over vegtables just ok. So we ordered more food. One eel and one tuna. That was amazingly fantastic. wow. I am really liked the sound of the waterfall."}
{"input": "I went here on a VERY busy day and everything moved very quickly! The ingredients are fresh, delicious, and beautiful. You have your option to creat your own bowl (chipotle style) or order one of their suggested combinations. They top it off with a cute little flower at the end :) I loved this place and will definitely be coming back!"}
{"input": "I went today to buy a growler of Oh Coaly Night ( hard to get and just released) The lady was helpful and worked with me as I did not have a growler. She let me buy a 5 litre bottle and gfilled it and charged  me accordingly. She could have blew me off. The Oh Coaly was  ( is) wonderful"}
{"input": "We waited for 1 1/2 hours to be seated which is fine considering they told us that when we put our names down, but after being seated we waited 45 min for our food to come which is ridiculous. The food was very good. The biscuit was soft and yummy, but no meal is good when you have to wait as along as we did."}
{"input": "Me and my family went yesterday. We ordered 12 donuts. All different. We didn't know that you couldn't order with two toppings bc they only can \"hold one topping\" ... the donuts where made fresh and topped to order. They were amazing. They did take a little longer because they are fresh but we made it just before a rush. They were warm and GREAT! Would highly recommend... a little bit more expensive than dunkin but worth it. I'm not normally a cake donut (no yeast here) fan but these are a treat!"}
{"input": "Loved this place!!! Beautiful room, and awesome location. The streetcar runs right in front of the inn and it takes you to canal. Stay here!"}
{"input": "Food was reasonably priced and the portions were large. Half priced sushi on Wednesday is awesome. Service was really good. I would give it a try."}
{"input": "Salad portions are great. I always go with the Greek. One of the few Nick's spots that serves a rustic roast beef sandwich. Highly recommend that one. Pizza isn't that bad. I'd recommend an XL if having guests over. It's probably there better pizza, surprisingly."}
{"input": "Great place to go for your fitness needs. Friendly staff and state of the art equipment and well maintained. Saturdays seems to work out for me compared to others days. \n\nGood environmental setting that motivates and I love to go there rather than doing the cardio at home."}
{"input": "It's pretty obvious that they care about their critters.  It's hard to comparison shop for vets, but they seem a little expensive.  But our dogs are well taken care of there."}
{"input": "This place is just the best. If you really have to ask why it's all in the name itself. If u don't like chicken then don't come here bc their birds are fly! Don't forget to try their fried corn on the cobs. It's dank!"}
{"input": "Love this place introduced almost 25 years ago when I enrolled at the UD and have loved ever since. For longest time it was basically just a Delaware treat but so happy it is so many more places now. Just want to know when you are coming to the Huntsville AL area. Sorry this review is not about this specific location but if it is half as good as others I have been to it will be great!!! This location has plenty of seating was real clean and playing good tunes as I waited. About only negative is it doesn't have Herrs chips like the Delaware locations but that is not really a problem."}
{"input": "I walked in to an amazing set by an all-female bluegrass outfit (with the owner, Layla, on drums) and soon the talent segued into a tears-in-your-beer and honky-tonking country four-piece."}
{"input": "It was our first visit and we loved it!  The grouper was fresh, the coleslaw and hush puppies were delicious and my husband has a new favorite fish-Pompano.  Definitely will come back!"}
{"input": "We just moved to Narberth and had our first meal at this neighborhood gem. What a wonderful surprise. This restaurant is quiet and unassuming. When you enter it is busy, warm and down to earth. The service was excellent and the food a fantastic surprise. I enjoyed the Rosemary Chicken and Artichoke over Bowtie Pasta. It was savory, fresh and fragrant with herbs. My dinner partners enjoyed their dishes, too-  Shrimp with Andouille Sausage, Grilled Wild Striped Bass and a Veal dish.\nThere were many homemade dessert options. We tried a generous portioned Chocolate Mousse cake.\nDefinitely recommend this place and will return to check out the weekend brunch menu!"}
{"input": "Great beignets and chicory coffee. This location is closing it's doors after 40 years. This will be my first and last time here. I would have liked to have come back. I think I am now addicted to beignets."}
{"input": "Stopped in for a late lunch upon arrival. We were famished. Our server was on the case and he took great care of us. Made recommendations regarding menu items and drink suggestions--everything spot on. My oysters were fresh and tasty. The boiled shrimp were incredible--a huge portion and SO fresh. Crab cakes were big and crisp. Loved my cup of gumbo as well. Even though it was hot outside and all the windows were open, it was nice and cool inside due to the many large overhead fans. Go here."}
{"input": "Thoroughly enjoyed our dinner here a few weeks ago. Very cool atmosphere and love that you can byob or order wine there. Set menu of multiple courses, with the only option to choose if you wanted beef or lamb for the main course- we chose lamb. Every dish was flavorful and distinct. The belly dancer was fun and the other groups in our room were nice as well. Would definitely go back again."}
{"input": "Love the lamb gyros plate. It's a distance for me to drive, so sometimes I get an extra order to take back home.  The tiramisu is very good too. The dolmas are good but more vinegary than I prefer.  The Greek salad that comes with the entree' is good also."}
{"input": "So glad to have stumbled upon this place. Everything is homemade and AMAZING!! Service was fast and jovial-JOVIAL! I had the homemade bacon & potato soup and a chicken salad sandwich. My mother had the same soup and a tuna salad sandwich. Homemade bread!! This was easily the best lunch I've had in a very long time. Highly recommended and hope to venture to Plant City again just to eat here."}
{"input": "Great clothing at a great price. They have suits and tuxedos from $25 to $50 and they are high dollar suits too. The best part is all proceeds go towards college students to help them financially. So shop here for great clothing at great prices."}
{"input": "I recently moved in a few blocks away from Henry's and was looking forward to having a neighborhood coffee spot not far from my house. So, on a beautifully humid August morning I walked over to check it. \n\n1) The atmosphere is pretty standard. Open space with the coffee bar in the back left corner and ordinary tables and chairs scattered throughout. No college coffee shop couches or armchairs but no industrial airbnb chic vibe either. Lacked uniqueness. \n\n2) The name Henry reminds me of Thomas the tank engine. Was there a train named Henry on there or not? If so, was he chill or not. Could add one star for chill train association. \n\n3) The coffee was not good. I got an iced coffee (STFU) and it was super bitter. The amount of ice in it wasn't obscene so it had that going for it but other than that idk.\n\nI'm coming back to try some hot coffee or espresso on a cooler day but damn Henry :((( not a great first impression."}
{"input": "Completely inconsistent. Used to be much better. Half of the time everything falls completely off the pizza. Staff is programmed to tell you at least 30 minutes to pick up your food no matter what you order or how busy they are. I have called from the parking lot knowing they were empty at 11:30 on a.sunday and told 35 minutes. I went in after 14 minutes and pizza was sitting there ready.  Overpriced and inconsistent. Long island and Massimo's are both way better, oh and they deliver!!"}
{"input": "The Habit is my weekly habit. I love this place. they are fast, inexpensive, and delicious. I could eat here everyday of the week and not get tired of it. Teriyaki burger is the  greatest thing invented."}
{"input": "We got the Taiwanese meat ball, beef chow fun, and a mango smoothie. \n\nThe meat ball was a little bit hard--I suspect they made them beforehand, refrigerated them, and then didn't heat them up as much as they needed to before they served them. There was not enough sauce on top of it for a Taiwanese meat ball.\n\nThe chow fun was good. No complaints there.\n\nThe smoothie was terrible. Either the mango that they used was not ripe or they used mango juice instead of real fruit. 0/10, would not recommend."}
{"input": "Just came from my first wax at Heads & Tails and let me tell you - they have a lifetime customer out of me. And that says a lot coming from me.\n\nWhat is there not to love? The place is adorrrrable! Just a small corner location with two blow-dry stations and two waxing rooms. It's decorated in a cute, feminine style that fits the theme of Heads & Tails perfectly. \n\nThe price is very, very fair. A $60 brazilian wax with blue wax is beyond reasonable, and the $45 custom option is brilliant - it's perfect for people who want a brazilian without the back (if you know what I mean). And $35 blow outs? If only I could afford to get my hair professionally dried every few days!\n\nI honestly never thought I'd say this, but I look forward to the next time I come back to Heads & Tails. Jenne is super talented at what she does, and the entire experience could not be better. Beyond 5 stars!"}
{"input": "Best iced latte and beignet we tried. The live music also creates a great atmosphere. We also visited Cafe du Monde but in our opinion Cafe Beignet is much better. The service is also very good and there are hardly ever lines."}
{"input": "Wow! Great recommendation by the Green House Inn staff!  Happy hour was great - although there was wait to be seated (we eventually were sat in the back room that was completely empty until we were shown our table). Oysters, pate, fried oyster salad were impalpable - but food envy of neighboring tables burger, gumbo, and the special!\n\nA must!!"}
{"input": "Dear Lord the biscuits here are heavenly! The biscuits and gravy are well seasoned with a very nice portion for $5.89. \n\nThe pancakes were sweet and tasty, not dry at all. \n\nI also ordered the breakfast burrito with sausage and will definitely order this next time I am there! :) \n\nThe coffee is great too, and they will give you a nice to-go cup to take some on the road. \n\nThe Roost: \"Worth the wait and the weight.\""}
{"input": "Worst concert experience I've had. Buyers, beware. They're only interested in your money NOT your experience. My husband spent A LOT of money on an Imagine Dragons VIP package and it left much to be desired. The \"gift bag\" was filled with a small, cheap crumpled poster, plastic sunglasses, a pop socket, and a phone charger fit for a circa 2015 android. The \"crowd free shopping\" consisted of about 200 people crammed in a small area with general admission goers, and the \"hassle free entry\" took 45 minute. So, all in all I sit here really pissed about the experience, feeling bad for my husband who wanted to surprise, and the concert hasn't even started yet. Bravo CID. Thank you for seriously putting a damper on my night."}
{"input": "Best hummus in the world!! I come here almost every week, and I am always loving it! Friendly people, great food, yum yum!"}
{"input": "We had the Fellini salad and it was excellent...tons of ingredients, artichokes, mussels, shrimp, clams, crab, Italian meats and cheeses, etc. The 2 pastas were cooked perfectly.  It was extremely busy, but we didn't have to wait long at all for our meals.  Nicki was both professional and friendly."}
{"input": "Everything here is sticky. Sticky floor, sticky table, sticky soy sauce bottles, sticky receipt book...  I got the sushi lunch special. The salad was pretty good, but the miso soup was super super salty. The sushi (crunchy shrimp roll) was good, but next time I'll go to Koi which is close, clean, and has much better food."}
{"input": "Whenever we can't decide where to go...we go to Hollywood grill. They have something for everyone. It is a typical diner but slightly cleaner than most. The food prices are competitive but not \"cheap\". The service is sufficient but not outstanding. \n\nIf someone wants pancakes and you want dinner...you came to the right place"}
{"input": "A bacon-lover's paradise. Huge fan of the bacon sampler (would have never guessed that I liked chocolate bacon) and the LTA (lettuce, tomato, and avacado...with bacon, of course!). It's awesome that they also do drinks. Fast service, friendly staff. Only downside that we noted in the two times we went was the bad habit of telling us they were out of ingredients after we'd already ordered (out of this kind of bread or that kind of mixer), which was a little frustrating because we would have changed our order if we'd known in advance. All in all, though, definitely worth a visit for breakfast or lunch."}
{"input": "Karma is very delicious! I typically get the acai bowls, or the energy squares that they sell. I come here quite a few times in a month. The only negative thing I can say is that when I order my bowls. Sometimes it has almonds and others it doesn't, it kind of pisses me off because I love almonds, so I expect them each time, too little of a detail to ruins someone's day about but I just feel it should be a little more consistent"}
{"input": "A group of us recently stopped n for dinner. While we were seated right away it took 15 minutes to place a drink order. They were not real busy either. The beers were great as usual. The food quality was another story. I order the pork steak. It was as thick as in the past. It was way over cooked to Beijing like the old saying dry as a bone. A friend ordered a medium burger. The cow was killed twice. It was well done. My girlfriend the pretzel chicken. It had no seasoning and dry.  A totally unexpected disappointing experience."}
{"input": "We love the craft cocktails and craft beers. The food is hit and miss. The batter on the fish and chips doesn't hold up. It's soggy and gross. The quality of the fish is good but a new batter recipe is mandatory. Their classic burger is good and so are the fries."}
{"input": "Companion is one of the best lunch spots in Clayton.  The menu is salads, sandwiches and soups.  If you get there on the earlier side you may be able to grab some of their delicious baked eggs or oatmeal.  I actually worked at companion back in 2001... What a change it has gone through, but the food is still just as yummy.  \n\nMy salad rotation goes between the Picnic Basket and the Go Green... But all of the salads are a good sized portion with lots of goodness in them.  You can't go wrong with any of the salads.  The sandwiches are all also great - my husband loves the Frenchie, I love the Mermaid or the regular chicken salad sandwich or the Fa La La... YUM, the breads are all made in house.\n\nI will always love Companion and go for lunch a lot - it's basically every week at this point."}
{"input": "Great food but it is a little touristy. I am spoiled because I am a local and go to the spongedocks a lot. If this is your first time in the area, Hella's is a must. Even if only for their bakery. If i could write a separate review for bakery, it would be 5 star"}
{"input": "I am a huge fan of Elmo's and I will probably like this place a lot more next time I go. \n\nI made the mistake of getting the \"Izzy style steak\" which was a pepper encrusted sirloin. It was overpowering and all you could taste was the pepper. I am sure the beef was good but just could not taste it. The orange brandy glaze sounded great but tasted awful.\n\nThe shrimp cocktail, as usual, was awesome and should not be missed."}
{"input": "The quality and service here are excellent. We've loved every meal we've had at Ron's, and we've had many! It's our favorie place for a family dinner out."}
